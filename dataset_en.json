{"text":{"0":"All persons are fit to evaluate or to be made the subjects of evaluation, are fit to vow another's worth or have their worth vowed: priests, Levites and ordinary Israelites, women and slaves. The tumtum and the hermaphrodite are fit to vow another's worth, or to have their worth vowed, and are fit to evaluate, but they are not fit to be made the subjects of evaluation, for the subject of evaluation must be definitely either male or female. A deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor are fit to have their worth vowed or be made the subject of evaluation, but they are not fit to make either a vow of another's worth or to evaluate, because they have no intelligence. A person less than one month old may have his worth vowed  but not his valuation.","1":"A non-Jew: Rabbi Meir says: he can be evaluated but he cannot evaluate. Rabbi Judah says: he can evaluate but cannot be evaluated. Both agree that he can vow another's worth and have his worth vowed by others.","2":"One at the point of death or about to be put to death cannot have his worth vowed, nor be evaluated. Rabbi Hanina ben Akavia says: he can be evaluated because his value is fixed, but his worth cannot be vowed because his worth is not fixed. Rabbi Yose says: he may vow, evaluate, and consecrate to the sanctuary, and if he caused damage, he is obliged to make restitution.","3":"If a woman is about to be executed, they do not wait for her until she gives birth. But if she had already sat on the birthstool, they wait for her until she gives birth. If a woman has been put to death one may use her hair. If an animal has been put to death it is forbidden to make any use of it.","4":"There is no evaluation less than one sela, nor more than fifty selas. How so? If one paid a sela and became rich, he need not give any more. But if he gave less than a sela and became rich, he must pay fifty selas. If he had five selas in his possession: Rabbi Meir says: he need not give more than one; The sages say he must give them all. There is no evaluation less than one sela, nor more than fifty selas. If a woman makes a mistake in her reckoning there is no re-opening for her of the niddah count earlier than seven, nor later than after seventeen days. No signs of leprosy are shut up for less than one week and none more than three weeks.","5":"There are never less than four full months in the year, nor did it seem right to have more than eight. Two loaves were eaten, never earlier than the second day, nor later than the third day. The shewbread was eaten never earlier than the ninth day, nor later than the eleventh day. An infant may never be circumcised earlier than the eighth nor later than the twelfth day.","6":"There are never less than twenty-one blasts in the Temple and never more than forty-eight. There are never less than two harps, nor more than six. There are never less than two flutes, nor more than twelve. On twelve days in the year the flute was played before the altar: At the slaughtering of the first pesah, At the killing of the second pesah, On the first festival day of Pesah, On the festival day of Atzeret (Shavuot), And on the eight days of Sukkot. And they did not play on a pipe abuv of bronze but on a pipe of reed, because its tune is sweeter. Nor was anything but a single pipe used for closing a tune, because it makes a pleasant finale.","7":"They were slaves of the priests, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose said: they were of families from Bet Hapegarim, Bet-Zipparya and from Emmaus, places from which priests would marry women. Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonos said: they were Levites.","8":"There were never less than six inspected lambs in the chamber of lambs, enough for Shabbat and the two festival days of Rosh Hashanah, and their number could be increased infinitely. There were never less than two trumpets and their number could be increased infinitely. There were never less than nine lyres, and their number could be increased infinitely. But there was only one cymbal.","9":"There were never less than twelve levites standing on the platform and their number could be increased into infinity. No minor could enter the court of the sanctuary to take part in the service except when the Levites stood up to sing. Nor did they join in the singing with harp and lyre, but with the mouth alone, to add flavor to the music. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob said: they did not count in the required number, nor did they stand on the platform. Rather they would stand on the ground, so that their heads were between the feet of the levites. And they were called the youth of the Levites.","10":"The law of evaluation is sometimes lenient, and at others times strict. The law of the field of possession is sometimes lenient, and at others times strict. The law concerning a warned ox that has killed a slave is sometimes lenient, and at others times strict. The law of the rapist and the seducer and the defamer is sometimes lenient, and at others times strict. The law of evaluation is sometimes lenient, and at others times strict. How so? Whether one has evaluated the fairest in Israel, or the ugliest in Israel, he must pay fifty selas. But if he said: \u201cBehold, his monetary worth is upon me,\u201d he pays only as much as he is worth.","11":"\u201cThe law of the field of possession is sometimes lenient and sometimes strict.\u201dHow so? Whether one dedicates a field in the sandy plain of Mahoz or in the orchards of Savaste, if he would redeem it he must pay fifty shekels of silver for every part of the field sufficient for the sowing of a homer of barley. But if it was a field which he bought, he must pay what it is worth. Rabbi Eliezer says: it is all the same whether it is a field of possession or one that he bought. What is the difference between the field of possession and one that he bought? A field of possession he must pay the added fifth, whereas for a field that he has bought he need not pay the added fifth.","12":"\u201cThe law concerning a warned ox that has killed a slave is sometimes lenient and sometimes strict.\u201dHow so? Whether it killed the fine looking slave or an ugly slave, he must pay thirty selas. If it killed a free man he must pay what he is worth. If it wounded, whether this one or the other, he must pay the full damage.","13":"\u201cThe law of the rapist and seducer is sometimes lenient and sometimes strict.\u201dHow so? Whether he raped or seduced a girl from among the best of the priestly stock or the humblest in Israel, he must pay fifty selas. But compensation for shaming and for blemish is in accord with the circumstances of him who shames and of the one who suffers the shame.","14":"The law of the defamer is sometimes lenient and sometimes strict.How so? Whether he defamed a girl from among the best of the priestly stock or the humblest in Israel, he must pay one hundred selas. Thus it turns out that he who speaks with his mouth suffers more than he that commits an act. For thus we have also found that the judgment against our fathers in the wilderness was sealed only because of their evil tongue, as it is written: \u201cYet you have tested me these ten times, and you have not listened to My voice\u201d (Numbers 14:22).","15":"The sufficiency of means is according to the ability of the vower. And the age is according to the subject of the vow. The evaluation is according to the subject of the evaluation. And the evaluations shall be paid according to the rate prescribed at the time of the evaluation. The sufficiency of means is according to the ability of the vower. How so? If a poor man evaluated a rich man, he pays only the valuation of a poor man. But if a rich man evaluated a poor man, he must pay the valuation of a rich man.","16":"But it is not so with sacrifices. If he said: \u201cI take upon myself the sacrifices of this metzora,\u201d and the metzora was poor, he brings the sacrifices of a poor metzora. But if the metzora was rich, he must bring the sacrifices of a rich man. Rabbi says: I say the same applies with regard to an evaluation. Why is a poor man who evaluated a rich man obliged to pay only the evaluation of a poor man? Because the rich man is not obligated at all. But if the rich man said: \u201cMy value is upon me\u201d and the poor man, hearing that, said: \u201cWhat this man has said, I take upon myself,\u201d then he must pay the evaluation of a rich man. If he was poor and then became rich, or rich and then became poor, he must pay the evaluation of a rich man. Rabbi Judah says: even if he was poor and became rich and then again became poor he must pay the evaluation of a rich man.","17":"But it is not so with sacrifices. Even if his father was dying when a man vowed and left him ten thousand, or if he had a ship on the sea and it brought to him ten thousand, the sanctuary has no claim at all on them.","18":"\u201cAnd the age is according to the subject of the vow:\u201d How so? If a child evaluates an old man, he must pay the value of an old man. And if an old man evaluates a child he must pay the value of a child. The evaluation is according to the subject of the evaluation. How so? If a man evaluated a woman, he must pay the value of a woman. And if a woman evaluated a man, she must pay the value of a man. \u201cAnd the evaluations shall be paid according to the rate prescribed at the time of the evaluation.\u201d How so? If he evaluated one who was less than five years of age, and he became meantime older than five years of age, or if he evaluated one who was less than twenty years of age and he became twenty years old, he must pay only in accord with the age at the time of the valuation. The thirtieth day is considered to be under this age. The fifth year or twentieth year is considered to be under this age. For it says: \u201cAnd if he is from sixty years old and upward\u201d (Leviticus 27:7), thus we can learn thus with regard to all others from what is said about sixty years: just as the sixtieth year is considered to be under this age, so also the fifth and twentieth years are under this age. Is that so! Just because the Torah accounts the sixtieth year to be under this age, thereby being more stringent, shall we make the fifth or the twentieth year be considered under this age, in order to be lenient? Scripture says, \u201cYears,\u201d \u201cyears\u201d as a gezerah shavah: just as with the sixtieth year the word \u201cyears\u201d means that it is considered under this age, so the word \u201cyears\u201d with the fifth and with the twentieth year are considered under this age, whether this results in being lenient or being stringent. Rabbi Elazar says: this rule holds good until they are a month and a day beyond the year.","19":"One who said: \u201cI vow my weight,\u201d he must pay his weight, in silver if he had said in silver, or in gold if he had said in gold. It happened with the mother of Yirmatia, who said, \u201cI vow my daughter's weight.\u201d She went up to Jerusalem and weighed her and then paid her weight in gold. If a man said: \u201cI vow the weight of my hand,\u201d Rabbi Judah says: let him fill a barrel with water and put it his hand in up to the elbow. Then let him weigh the flesh, bones and sinews of a donkey and put it into the barrel until it is filled up again. Rabbi Yose said: \u201cBut how is it possible to account exactly one kind of flesh against another kind of flesh, and one kind of bones against another kind of bones? Rather: one estimates what the hand is likely to weigh.","20":"If one said \u201cThe worth of my hand is upon me,\u201d they estimate his worth with his hand and what it would be without his hand. In this respect vows of worth are more stringent than vows of value. There is an aspect of vows of value that is more stringent than vows of worth. How so? If one said: \u201cMy value is upon me\u201d and then he dies, his heirs must pay it. But if he said: \u201cMy worth is upon me,\u201d and then he dies, his heirs need not pay anything because dead persons have no worth. If he said, \u201cThe value of my hand or foot is upon me,\u201d he has said nothing, But if he said, \u201cThe value of my head is upon me,\u201d he must pay his whole value. This is the general rule: Anything upon which his life depends, he must pay his full value.","21":"If one said: \u201cHalf my value is upon me,\u201d he must pay half his evaluation. But if he said, \u201cThe value of one half of me he is upon me,\u201d he must pay his full value. If he said \u201cHalf of my worth is upon me,\u201d he must pay half his worth. If he said, \u201cThe worth of half of me is upon me,\u201d he must pay his whole worth. This is the general rule: Anything on which his life depends, he must pay his whole worth.","22":"If he said: \u201cThe value of so-and-so is upon me,\u201d if both the vower and the subject of the vow died, then the heirs must pay it. If he said, \u201cThe worth of so-and-so is upon me,\u201d and the vower died, the heirs must pay it. But if the subject of the vow died, the heirs need not pay anything because dead persons have no worth.","23":"If someone said: \u201cThis ox shall be an olah a whole burnt offering,\u201d or \u201cThis house shall be an olah,\u201d and the ox died or the house fell down, he is not obligated to pay. But if he said: \u201cThis ox is upon me as an olah\u201d or \u201cthis house is upon me as an olah\u201d and the ox died, or the house fell down, he is obligated to pay their worth.","24":"With regard to those who made a vow of value: they take a pledge from them. With regard to those obligated to bring a hatat or asham: they do not take a pledge. With regard to those obligated to bring an olah or a shelamim: they do take a pledge. And even though he is not atoned for unless he is willing to pay his obligation, as it is said: \u201cwillingly\u201d (Leviticus 1:3), they coerce him until he says: I agree. The same is true in the case of divorce documents: they coerce him until he says: I agree.","25":"The property of orphans which has been evaluated must be proclaimed for thirty days. And the property of the Sanctuary which has been evaluated, for sixty days. They must make the proclamation in the morning and in the evening. If a man dedicates his property to the Sanctuary and he is still liable for his wife\u2019s ketubah: Rabbi Eliezer says: when he divorces her he must vow that he will not derive any further benefit from her. Rabbi Joshua says: he need not do so. Similarly, Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said: Also if one guarantees a woman's ketubah and her husband divorces her, the husband must vow to derive no benefit from her, lest he make a conspiracy against the property of that man the guarantor and take his wife back again.","26":"A man who dedicates his possessions to the sanctuary while he is still liable for his wife's kethubah or in debt to a creditor, the wife cannot collect her ketubah from the consecrated property nor the creditor his debt.  Rather he who redeems them must redeem for the purpose of paying the wife her ketubah or the creditor his debt. If he had dedicated ninety maneh, worth of property, and he owed one hundred maneh, then he the creditor must add one dinar more and he redeems the property for the purpose of paying the ketubah to the wife or the debt to the creditor.","27":"Even though they said: they take pledges from those who owe vows of value, they allow him food for thirty days, clothing for twelve months, bed and bedding, shoes and tefillin. For himself, but not for his wife and children. If he was a craftsman, they leave him two tools of every kind. If he was a carpenter, they leave him two axes and two saws. Rabbi Eliezer says: if he was a farmer, they leave him his yoke of oxen. If a donkey driver, they leave him his donkey.","28":"If he had many tools of one kind, and few of another kind, they may not say to him to sell the many and buy some of the few, but one leaves him two of the kind of which he has many and all that he has from those of which he has few. One who consecrates all his possessions to the Sanctuary, they count his tefillin in the evaluation.","29":"Whether one consecrates his property or evaluates himself, it the Sanctuary has no claim to his wife's garment or his children's garment or to the dyed clothes which he had dyed for their use or to the new sandals which he has bought for their use. Although they said: \u201cSlaves are sold with their garments to increase their value,\u201d because when a garment for thirty denars is bought for him his value is increased by a maneh. And likewise with a cow, if it is kept waiting to the market-day it increases in value, and similarly a pearl, if brought to a big city increases in value. Nevertheless, the Sanctuary can only claim the value of anything in its own place and at its own time.","30":"One may not consecrate a field of his possession less than two years before the Jubilee, nor redeem it less than one year after the Jubilee. One does not reckon months to the disadvantage of the Sanctuary, but the Sanctuary does reckon months to its own advantage. If a man consecrated his field at a time when the law of the Jubilee is in force, he must pay fifty shekels for every piece of field sufficient for the sowing of a homer of barley. If the field contained ravines ten handbreadths deep or rocks ten handbreadths high, they are not included as part of the field. But if less than this, they are included. If he consecrated it two or three years before the Jubilee, he must pay one sela shekel and one pondion for each year. If he says: \u201cI shall pay for each year as it comes,\u201d they do not listen to him, rather he must pay for all the years together.","31":"It is all the same whether the owner or anyone else redeems the field. What is the difference between the owner and any other man? The owner must add one fifth, whereas any other man need not add one fifth.","32":"If a man consecrated his field and then redeemed it, it does not go out of his possession in the Jubilee. If his son redeemed it, it reverts to his father in the Jubilee. If another person, or a relative redeemed it, and he redeemed it from his hand, it goes out to the priests. If one of the priests redeemed it, and it was still in his possession, he cannot say: \u201cSince it goes out to the priests in the Jubilee, and since it is now in my possession, therefore it belongs to me.\u201d Rather, it goes out of his possession to all his fellow priests.","33":"If the Jubilee arrived and it was not yet redeemed then the priests enter into possession of the land and they pay its value, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Shimon says: they enter into possession but they do not pay its value. Rabbi Eliezer says: they neither enter into possession nor pay its value. But it is called an abandoned field until the second Jubilee. If the second jubilee has arrived and it was not yet redeemed, it is called a \u2018twice abandoned field\u2019 until the third Jubilee. The priests never enter into possession of the field until someone else had redeemed it.","34":"If one bought a field from his father, and his father died and afterwards he consecrated it, it is considered a field of possession. If he consecrated it and afterwards his father died, then it is considered a field acquired by purchase, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Shimon say: it is considered a field of possession, as it is said: \u201cAnd if a field which he has, which is not a field of his possession\u201d a field which is not capable of becoming a field of his possession, thus excluding a field which is capable of becoming a field of possession. A field acquired by purchase does not go out to the priests in the year of the Jubilee, for no man can consecrate an object not belonging to him. Priests and Levites may consecrate their fields at any time and redeem at any time, both before and after the jubilee.","35":"If one consecrated his field at a time when the law of the Jubilee was no longer observed, they say to him: \u201cYou open the bidding!\u201d because the owner must pay an added fifth, whereas others do not pay an additional fifth. It happened that one consecrated his field because it was bad. They said to him: \u201cYou open the bidding.\u201d He said: \u201cI will acquire it for an issar.\u201d Rabbi Yose said: he did say that, but rather \u201cfor an egg,\u201d because consecrated objects may be redeemed by either money or money's equivalent. He the Temple treasurer said to him: It\u2019s yours. It turns out he lost an issar and the field was his again.","36":"If one said: I will acquire it for ten selas, and another, for twenty, and another for thirty, and another for forty, and another for fifty, If he that bid fifty reneged, they take pledges from his property up to ten selas. If he that bid forty reneged, they take pledges from his property up to ten selas. If he that bid thirty reneged, they take pledges from his property up to ten selas. If he that bid twenty reneged they take pledges from his property up to ten selas. If he that bid ten reneged they sell the field for what it is worth, and collect what remains from him who bid ten. If the owner bid twenty and any other man bid twenty, then the owner comes first, because he must add one fifth.","37":"If one said I will acquire it for twenty-one selas, then the owners must pay twenty-six. If one said Twenty-two, the owners must pay twenty-seven. Twenty-three, the owners must pay twenty-eight. Twenty-four, the owners must pay twenty-nine. Twenty-five, the owners must pay thirty, For they need not add one fifth to what the other bids more. If one said: I will acquire it for twenty-six, if the owners want to pay thirty-one and an extra denar, the owner comes first. And if not, we say to the other: It has become yours.","38":"A man may proscribe part of his flock or of his herd, of his Canaanite slaves or female slaves or of his field of possession. But if he proscribed all of them, they are not considered validly proscribed, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah said: just as when it comes to the Highest One, one is not permitted to proscribe all of his possessions, how much more so should one be careful with his property.","39":"If one proscribes his son or his daughter, or his Hebrew slave or female slave, or the field which he acquired by purchase, they are not considered validly proscribed, for one can proscribe something that does not belong to him. Priests and Levites cannot proscribe their belongings, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Shimon says: the priests cannot proscribe, because things proscribed belong to them. But Levites can proscribe, because things proscribed do not belong to them. Rabbi says: the words of Rabbi Judah seem acceptable in cases of immovable property as it is said: \u201cFor that is their perpetual possession,\u201d and the words of Rabbi Shimon seem acceptable in cases of movable property, since things proscribed do not fall to them.","40":"Things proscribed for the use of the priests cannot be redeemed but are to be given to the priests. Rabbi Judah ben Batera says: things proscribed without specification fall to the fund for Temple repairs, as it was said: \u201cEvery proscribed thing is most holy to the Lord\u201d (Leviticus 27:25). But the sages say: things proscribed without specification go to the priests, as it is said: \u201cAs a field proscribed: its possession belongs to the priest\u201d (Leviticus 27:21). If so, why is it said: \u201cEvery proscribed thing is most holy to the Lord\u201d? This teaches that it applies to most holy and less holy things.","41":"A man may proscribe his holy things, whether they are most holy things or less holy things. If they had been consecrated as a vow, he must give their value, if as a freewill-offering, he must give what it is worth to him. If he said: \u201cLet this ox be an olah,\u201d one estimates how much a man would pay for the ox to offer it as an olah, which he was not obliged to offer. A first-born, whether unblemished or blemished, may be proscribed. How can it be redeemed? They estimate what a man would give for this first-born in order to give it to the son of his daughter or to the son of his sister. Rabbi Ishmael says: one verse says, All first-born males you shall sanctify,\u201d and another verse says: \u201cThe first-borns among beasts no man shall sanctify it\u201d (Leviticus 27:26). It is impossible to say: \u201cYou shall sanctify,\u201d since it was said already: \u201cNo man shall sanctify,\u201d and it is impossible to say: \u201cNo man shall sanctify,\u201d since it is also said: \u201cYou shall sanctify\u201d? Therefore resolve thus: you may sanctify it by consecrating its value to the owner, but you may not sanctify it by consecrating it to the altar.","42":"If one sold his field of possession at the time when the Jubilee was in force, he may not redeem it for two years, as it says: \u201cAccording to the number of the years of the crops he shall sell to you\u201d (Leviticus 25:15). If there was a year of blight or mildew, or a seventh year, it is not included in the count. If he only broke the ground without planting or left it fallow for a year, that year is included in the count. Rabbi Elazar says: if he sold it to him before Rosh Hashanah year, and it was still full of fruit, he enjoys three crops in two years.","43":"If he sold it to the first for one hundred denars and the first sold it to the second for two hundred, then he need reckon only with the first, as it says, \u201cWith the man to whom he sold\u201d the man in possession of the field. One may not sell a distant field in order to redeem a near one, or a poor field in order to redeem a good one. One may not borrow money in order to redeem, nor redeem it in halves. But in the case of objects consecrated all these things are permitted. In this respect the laws concerning a person\u2019s property are more stringent than those concerning sacred things.","44":"If one sold a house among the houses of a walled city, he may redeem it at once and at any time during twelve months. This is a kind of interest, yet it is not interest. If the seller died, his son may redeem it. If the purchaser died, it may be redeemed from his son. One counts the year only from the time that he sold it, as it is said, \u201cBefore a full year has elapsed\u201d (Leviticus 25:30). When it says a \u201ca full\u201d year the extra month is included. Rabbi says: he is allowed a year and its extra month.","45":"If the last day of the twelve months has arrived and it was not redeemed, it becomes his permanent possession. This applies whether he bought it or received it as a gift, as it is said: \u201cbeyond reclaim\u201d (Leviticus 25:30). In earlier times, he the buyer would hide on the last day of the twelve months, so that the house might become his permanent possession. Hillel enacted that he the seller could deposit his money in the chamber and break down the door and enter, and that the other the buyer, whenever he wanted, might come and take his money.","46":"Whatever is within the city wall is regarded as the houses in a walled city, with the exception of fields. Rabbi Meir says: even fields. A house built into the wall: Rabbi Judah says: it is not considered a house within a walled city. Rabbi Shimon says: its outer wall is regarded as its city wall.","47":"A city whose roofs look as if they form its wall, Or that was not encompassed by a wall in the days of Joshua ben Nun, is not considered like houses in a walled city. A house in any of the following counts a house in a walled city: those in a city of no less than three courtyards, having two houses each, which have been encompassed by a wall in the days of Joshua ben Nun, such as the old acroplis of Tzippori, the fort of Gush-Halav, old Yodfat, Gamla, G'dod, Hadid, Ono, Jerusalem and other similar cities.","48":"Houses in courtyards - we accord to them the advantages of houses in a walled city and the advantages given to fields: They can be redeemed at once, and at any time within the twelve months like houses in a walled city, and they return to the owners in the Jubilee or at an earlier time by payment of a reduced price like fields. The following are considered houses in courtyards: a city which has two courtyards, each having two houses, even though they have been encompassed by a wall since the days of Joshua ben Nun, they count as houses in courtyards.","49":"If an Israelite inherited from his mother's father who was a Levite, he cannot redeem it according to the order prescribed here. Also if a Levite inherited from his mother's father who was an Israelite, he cannot redeem it according to the order prescribed here, As it says, \u201cAs for the houses of the cities of the Levites\u201d this order does not apply unless he is a Levite and in the cities of the Levites, the words of Rabbi. The sages say: these things apply to the cities of the Levites. One may not turn a field into pasture land, nor pasture land into a field, nor pasture land into a city, nor a city into pasture land. Rabbi Elazar said: When is this so? When it comes to the cities of the Levites, but when it comes to cities of Israelites one may turn a field into pasture land, pasture land into a field, pasture land into a city, but not a city into pasture land, in order that they should not destroy the cities of Israel. Priests and Levites may sell a house at any time and redeem it at any time, as it is said: \u201cThe Levites shall forever have the right of redemption\u201d (Leviticus 25:32).","50":"An Israelite who buys a fetus of a donkey belonging to a non-Jew or who sells one to him, although this is not permitted, or who forms a partnership with him, or who receives an animal from him to look after or who gives his donkey to him to look after, is exempt from the law of the bekhor, for it says: \u201cI sanctified to me all the firstborn in Israel,\u201d but not in non-Jews. Priests and levites are exempt through an argument made by a kal vehomer: if they exempted the first-born belonging to the Israelites in the wilderness, it follows all the more so that they should exempt their own.","51":"If a cow gave birth to a species of donkey, or a donkey gave birth to a species of horse, it is exempt from the law of the firstling, for it is said, \u201cthe firstling of a donkey,\u201d \u201cthe firstling of a donkey,\u201d twice to teach that the law of the firstling does not apply until that which gives birth is a donkey and that which is born is a donkey. And what is the law with regard to eating them? If a clean animal gave birth to a species of unclean animal, it is permitted to be eaten. But if an unclean animal gave birth to a species of a clean animal, it is forbidden to be eaten, for that which comes out of the unclean is unclean and that which comes out of the clean is clean. If an unclean fish swallowed a clean fish, it is permitted to be eaten. But if a clean fish has swallowed an unclean fish, the latter is forbidden to be eaten, because it is not the clean fish's growth.","52":"If a donkey that had never before given birth gave birth to two males, he gives one lamb to the priest. If it gave birth to a male and a female, he sets aside one lamb which he keeps for himself. If two donkeys that had never before given birth gave birth to two males, he gives two lambs to the priest. If they gave birth to a male and a female or two males and a female, he gives one lamb to the priest. If they gave birth to two females and a male or to two males and two females the priest receives nothing.","53":"If one donkey had given birth before and one had not given birth before and they gave birth to two males, he gives one lamb to the priest. If they gave birth to a male and a female, he sets aside one lamb which he keeps for himself. For it says, \u201cAnd the firstling of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb\u201d (Exodus 34:20), the lamb can come either from the sheep or the goats, male or female, large or small, unblemished or blemished. He can redeem with the same lamb many times. And the lamb enters the pen to be tithed. If it dies before he gives it to the priest, he can benefit from it.","54":"We do not redeem with a calf, a wild animal, an animal slaughtered, a terefah, kilayim or a koy. Rabbi Eliezer permits redemption with kilayim because it is a lamb. But he forbids with a koy, because its nature is doubtful. If he gave the first-born of a donkey itself to the priest, the latter may not keep it, until he sets aside a lamb in its place.","55":"If one sets aside a lamb for the redemption of the first-birth of a donkey and it died: Rabbi Eliezer says: he is responsible as is the case with the five selas for the redemption of the first-born. But the sages say: he is not responsible, as is the case with the redemption of the second tithe. Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Zadok testified concerning the redemption of the first-born of a donkey which died that the priest receives nothing in such circumstances. If the first-born of a donkey died after the lamb for redemption had been set aside: Rabbi Eliezer says: it shall be buried, but the lamb may be used. But the sages say: it does not need to be buried and the lamb belongs to the priest.","56":"If he does not wish to redeem it, he breaks its neck from behind with a large knife and buries it. The mitzvah of redemption takes priority over the miztzah of breaking its neck, for it says: \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t redeem it, you must break its neck\u201d (Exodus 13:13). The mitzvah of designation takes priority over the mitzvah of redemption, for it says: \u201cWho has betrothed her to himself, he must let her be redeemed\u201d (Exodus 21:8). The mitzvah of yibbum is prior to the mitzvah of halitzah. This was so at first when they intended to carry out the mitzvah. But now that they do not intend to carry out the mitzvah, the rabbis have said: the mitzvah of halitzah takes priority over the mitzvah of yibbum. The mitzvah of redemption of an unclean animal whose value has been dedicated to the Temple is upon the owner. He takes priority over any other man, for it says: \u201cIf it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your evaluation\u201d (Leviticus 27:27).","57":"An Israelite who buys a fetus of a cow belonging to a non-Jew or who sells one to him, although this is not permitted, or who forms a partnership with him, or who receives an animal from him to look after or who gives his cow to him to look after, is exempt from the law of the bekhor, for it says: \u201cI sanctified to Me all the firstborn in Israel,\u201d but not in non-Jews. Priests and Levites are subject to the law of the first-born pure animal. They are not exempt from the law of the first-born of a clean animal, but only of a first-born son and the first-born of a donkey.","58":"All consecrated animals whose permanent physical blemish preceded their consecration and were then redeemed:Are subject to the law of the firstling and to the priestly gifts, And when they become like hullin by being redeemed they may be shorn and may be put to work. And their young and their milk are permitted after they have been redeemed. And he who slaughtered them outside the sanctuary is not liable. And they do not render what is substituted for them holy. And if they died they may be redeemed, except for the firstling and the tithe of cattle.","59":"All consecrated animals whose consecration preceded their permanent, or their impermanent blemish preceded their consecration and subsequently they contracted a permanent blemish, and they were redeemed:Are exempt from the law of the firstling, and from priestly gifts; And they are not like unconsecrated animals to be shorn or put to work; And even after they have been redeemed their young and their milk are forbidden; And he who slaughtered them outside the sanctuary is liable; And they render what was substituted for them holy, And if they died they must be buried.","60":"If one receives flock from a non-Jew on \u201ciron terms\u201d their offspring are exempt from the law of the first born. But the offspring of their offspring are liable to the law of the first born. If the Israelite put the offspring in the place of their mothers, then the offspring of the offspring are exempt, but the offspring of the offspring of the offspring are liable. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: even for ten generations the offspring are exempt from the law of the first born since they are pledged to the non-Jew.","61":"If a ewe gave birth to what looked like a kid, or a female goat gave birth to what looked like a lamb, it is exempt from the law of the first born. But if it some of the signs of its mother it is liable to the law of the first born.","62":"If a ewe which never before had given birth bore two males and both heads came forth simultaneously: Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: both belong to the priest for scripture says: \u201cThe males shall be the Lord\u2019s\u201d (Exodus 13:12). But the sages say: it is impossible, therefore one remains with the Israelite and the other is for the priest. Rabbi Tarfon says: the priest chooses the better one. Rabbi Akiva says: we compromise between them. The second one in the Israelite's possession is left to pasture until it becomes blemished and the owner is liable for the priest's gifts. Rabbi Yose exempts him. If one of them died: Rabbi Tarfon says: they divide the living one. Rabbi Akiva says: the burden of proof is upon the claimant. If it gave birth to a male and a female, the priest receives nothing in such circumstances.","63":"If two ewes which had never previously given birth bore two males, both belong to the priest. If they gave birth to a male and a female, the male belongs to the priest. If they gave birth to two males and a female, one remains with him, and the other belongs to the priest. Rabbi Tarfon says: the priest chooses the better one. Rabbi Akiva says: we compromise between them. The second one in the Israelite's possession is left to pasture until it becomes blemished and the owner is liable for the priest's gifts. Rabbi Yose exempts him. If one of them died: Rabbi Tarfon says: they divide the living one. Rabbi Akiva says: the burden of proof is upon the claimant. If they gave birth to two females and a male or two males and two females, the priest receives nothing in such circumstances.","64":"If one of the ewes had given birth and the other had never previously given birth and they bore two males, one remains with him and the other belongs to the priest. Rabbi Tarfon says: the priest chooses the better one. Rabbi Akiva says: we compromise between them. The second one in the Israelite's possession is left to pasture until it becomes blemished and the owner is liable for the priest's gifts. Rabbi Yose exempts him. For Rabbi Yose says: wherever the priest receives an animal in its place, he is exempt from the priestly gifts. Rabbi Meir however makes him liable. If one of them died: Rabbi Tarfon says: they divide the living one. Rabbi Akiva says: the burden of proof is upon the claimant. If they gave birth to a male and a female, the priest receives nothing in such circumstances.","65":"With regard to an animal that was born through a cesarean section and the first born which came after it:Rabbi Tarfon says: both go out to pasture until blemished and are eaten with their blemishes by the owners. But Rabbi Akiva says: neither of them is a first born; the first because it did not open its mother\u2019s womb, and the second, because another preceded it.","66":"If one buys an animal from a non-Jew and it is not known whether it had given birth or had not given birth: Rabbi Ishmael says: that born of a goat in its first year certainly belongs to the priest; after that, it is a questionable case of a first-born. That born of a ewe two years old certainly belongs to the priest; after that, it is a questionable case of a first born. That born of a cow or a donkey three years old certainly belongs to the priest; after that, it is a questionable case of a first born. Rabbi Akiva to him: if an animal were exempted from the law of the first born only with the birth of actual offspring, it would be as you say. But they said: the sign of offspring in small cattle is a discharge from the womb.  In large cattle, the after-birth; in a woman, the signs are the fetus and the after-birth. This is the general rule: Whenever it is known that it had given birth, the priest receives nothing. Whenever it had never given birth, it belongs to the priest. If there is a doubt, it shall be eaten blemished by the owners. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: if a large domestic animal has discharged a clot of blood, it the clot shall be buried, and it the mother is exempted from the law of the first born.","67":"Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel says: if one buys a nursing animal from a non-Jew, he need not fear that perhaps the offspring belongs to another animal. If he went among his herd and saw animals which had given birth for the first time nursing and animals which had not given birth for the first time nursing, we need not fear that perhaps the offspring of this one came to the other or perhaps the offspring of the other came to this one.","68":"Rabbi Yose ben Meshullam says: one who slaughters the first born, first clears a space with the butcher's knife on both sides and tears the hair, as long as he does not remove the wool from its place. And similarly one may tear the hair to show the place of the blemish to a sage.","69":"If a portion of the hair of a blemished first born fell out and he placed it in the window, and then he slaughtered the animal, Akavya ben Mahalalel allows it. But the sages forbid it, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Yose said to him: Akavya ben Mahalalel did not allow only in this case, but even in the case where the hair of a blemished first born which fell out and he placed it in the window, and the animal died subsequently, even in this case Akavya ben Mahalalel allows, but the sages forbid. If the wool of a first born is hanging loose, that part which appears on a level with the rest of the wool is permitted, whereas that which does not appear on a level with the rest of the wool is forbidden.","70":"For how long is an Israelite bound to take care of a first born? In the case of small cattle, for thirty days, and large cattle, fifty days. Rabbi Yose says: in the case of small cattle, three months. If the priest says to the Israelite during this period \u201cGive it to me,\u201d he must not give it to him. But if the first born was blemished and the priest said to him \u201cGive it to me so that I may eat it,\u201d then it is allowed. And in Temple times, if the first born was in an unblemished state and the priest said to him \u201cGive it to me, and I will offer it up it was allowed.\u201d A first born is eaten year by year both in an unblemished as well as in a blemished state,   for it is said: \u201cYou shall eat it before the Lord your God year by year\u201d (Deuteronomy 15:20).","71":"If a blemish appeared on it in its first year, he is permitted to keep it all the twelve months. If after the twelve months, however, he is not permitted to keep it except for thirty days.","72":"If one slaughtered the first born and then showed its blemish to an expert:Rabbi Judah permits, But Rabbi Meir says: since it was not slaughtered by the instructions of the expert, it is forbidden.","73":"If one who is not an expert sees a first born and it was slaughtered by his instructions, in such a case it shall be buried and he shall make reparation from his own pocket. If a non-expert judge gave a judgment and declared innocent a person who was really liable or made liable a person who was really innocent, declared unclean a thing which was clean or declared clean a thing which was really unclean, his decision stands but he has to make reparation from his own pocket. If the judge was an expert sanctioned by the court, he is exempt from making reparation. It happened once that a cow's womb was removed and Rabbi Tarfon gave it the cow to the dogs to eat. The matter came before the sages at Yavneh and they permitted the animal. Todos the physician said: no cow or pig leaves Alexandria of Egypt before its womb is removed in order that it may not breed. Rabbi Tarfon said: \u201cThere goes your donkey, Tarfon.\u201d Rabbi Akiva said to him: you are exempt, for you are an expert and whoever is an expert sanctioned by the court is exempt from reparation.","74":"If one takes payment for seeing first borns, they must not be slaughtered by his instructions unless he was an expert like Ila in Yavneh whom the sages permitted to accept four isars for small cattle and six as for large cattle, whether unblemished or blemished.","75":"If one takes payment to act as a judge, his judgments are void; to give evidence, his evidence is void; to sprinkle or to sanctify, the waters are considered cave waters and the ashes are considered burned ashes. If he was a priest and he was made unclean regarding his terumah, he must give him food and drink and rub him with oil. And if he was an old sage, he mounts him on a donkey. He also pays him as he would a workman.","76":"If one is suspected in connection with first borns, one must not buy from him even deer's flesh or unprocessed hides. Rabbi Eliezer says: one may buy from him female hides we may buy from him. One may not buy from him washed or dirty wool, but one may buy spun wool or garments.","77":"If one is suspected of ignoring the sabbatical year, one may not buy from him flax, even combed; but spun or woven flax may be bought from him.","78":"If one is suspected of selling terumah as hullin, one may not buy even water and salt from him, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Shimon says: one may not buy from him whatever is connected to terumah and tithes.","79":"One who is suspected of ignoring the sabbatical year is not suspected of ignoring also the tithes. One who is suspected of ignoring tithes is not suspected of ignoring also the sabbatical year. One who is suspected of ignoring both is suspected of ignoring the rules of purity. And it is possible for one to be suspected of ignoring the rules of purity and yet not be suspected of ignoring the two laws cited above. This is the general rule: one who is suspected of transgressing something must not give judgment on it or testify concerning it.","80":"All dedicated animals which became unfit for the altar are sold in a market, slaughtered in a market and weighed by the liter, except for a first born or a tithed animal, as their profit goes to the owners, whereas the profit on dedicated objects which became unfit goes to the Temple. One can weigh one piece of meat of the first-born against another piece of ordinary meat.","81":"Bet Shammai says: An Israelite must not be invited to share a blemished first born with a priest. But Bet Hillel permits this, even in the case of a non-Jew. If a first born has a blood attack, even if it is going to die, its blood may not be let, the words of Rabbi Judah. But the sages say: he may let its blood, as long as he does not make a blemish. And if he made a blemish, he must not slaughter it on account of this. Rabbi Shimon says: he may let blood, even though he makes a blemish.","82":"If one makes a slit in the ear of a firstborn animal, he may never slaughter it, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But the sages say: when another blemish appears, he may slaughter it on account of it. It happened that a quaestor saw an old male lamb with its long wool hanging down and asked: what is the meaning of this?  They replied: \u201cIt is a first born and is not to be slaughtered until it has a blemish,\u201d The quaestor took a dagger and slit its ear. The matter came before the sages and they permitted it.  After they had permitted, he went and sliced the ears of other first borns. The sages forbade them. Once children were once playing in a field. They tied the tails of sheep one to the other and one tail which belonged to a first born was severed. The matter came before the rabbis and they permitted the first born. When the children saw that they had permitted the first born to be slaughtered, they proceeded to tie the tails of other first borns. The sages forbade the other first borns. This is the rule: wherever the blemish is caused with the knowledge and consent of the owner it is forbidden, but, if it is not with his knowledge and consent, it is permitted.","83":"If a first born was running after him and he kicked it and thereby blemished it, he may slaughter it on account of this. Any blemish which might have been made by a person, Israelite shepherds are trustworthy whereas shepherds who are priests are not trustworthy. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: he is trustworthy with regard to somebody else's first born, but he is not trustworthy with regard to his own. Rabbi Meir says: one who is suspected of neglecting a religious matter must not issue judgment on it or give evidence concerning it.","84":"A priest is trusted to say, \u201cI have shown this first born to an expert and it is blemished.\u201d All are trust worthy with regard to the blemishes of a tithed animal. A first born whose eye was blinded or whose fore-foot was cut off, or whose hind-leg was broken, may be slaughtered with the approval of three persons of the synagogue. But Rabbi Yose says: even if twenty-three were present, it must not be slaughtered except with the approval of an expert.","85":"If one slaughtered a first born and it became known that he had not shown it to an expert: That which the purchasers have eaten, they ate, and he must return the money to them. That which they have not yet eaten, the flesh must be buried and he must return the money to them. And likewise if one slaughtered a cow and sold it and it became known that it was terefah: That which the purchasers have eaten, they ate, and he must return the money to them. That which they have not eaten, they return the flesh to him and he must return the money to them. If the purchasers, sold it to non-Jews or cast it to dogs, they must pay him the price of a terefah.","86":"In consequence of the following blemishes a first-born animal may be slaughtered:If its ear has become defective, from the cartilages inward but not if the defect is in the ear-flap; If it is slit although there was no loss of substance; If it is perforated with a hole as large as a karshinah Or if the ear has become dry. What is considered \u201cbecoming dry\u201d? If when pierced no drop of blood comes out. Rabbi Yose ben Meshullam says: it is dry when it crumbles when touched.","87":"One whose eyelid is pierced, defected or slit, Or if the eye has a cataract, or a tevalul, halazon snail-shaped, nahash snake-shaped or a berry-shaped growth on the eye, the animal is disqualified. What is a tevalul? The white of the eye breaking through the ring and entering into the black. But if the black breaks through the ring and goes into the white, it is not a disqualifying blemish, because there are no disqualifying blemishes as regards the white of the eye.","88":"Havarvar white spots on the cornea and water constantly dripping from the eye, are disqualifying blemishes. What do we mean by a permanent hawarwar? If it remained for a period of eighty days. Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: we must examine it three times in the eighty days. And the following are cases of constant dripping from the eye and how to test its permanency: if it ate for a cure fresh fodder and dry fodder from a field sufficiently watered by rain it is a permanent blemish, if not cured. If it ate fresh fodder and then dry fodder from a field requiring artificial irrigation, or if it ate dry fodder first and then fresh fodder from field watered by rain it is not a blemish unless it eats dry fodder after the fresh.","89":"If its nose is perforated, defective, or slit, or its upper lip perforated, defective, or slit these are disqualifying blemishes. If the outer incisors are defective or leveled to the gum or the molars are torn out completely, these are disqualifying blemishes. But Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: we do not examine behind the molars, nor the molars themselves.","90":"If the sheath of the penis is defective or the genitals of a female animal in the case of sacrificial offerings it is defective. If the tail is mutilated from the bone but not from the joint; or if the top end root of the tail is bared to the bone; or if there is flesh between one joint and another in the tail to the amount of a finger's breadth the animal is defective.","91":"If a first born has no testicles or if it only has one testicle, it is a blemish. Rabbi Ishmael says: if it has two pouches, then it has two testicles, but if it only has one pouch, then it only has one testicle. Rabbi Akiva says: the animal is placed on its buttocks and he squeezes the pouch. If a testicle is in there, inside the pouch it will eventually come out. It happened that one squeezed it and the testicle did not come out, but when it was slaughtered the testicle was found attached to the loins, and Rabbi Akiva permitted the animal while Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri prohibited it.","92":"If a first born has five legs or if it has only three legs, or if its feet are uncloven like that of a donkey, or if it is a shahul or a kasul these are blemishes. What is a shahul? An animal with a dislocated hip. What is a kasul? An animal one of whose hips is higher than the other.","93":"If the bone of the fore-leg or of its hind-leg is broken, even though it is not noticeable,   this is a blemish. These blemishes Ila enumerated in Yavneh and the sages agreed with him. He also added another three cases of blemishes. They said to him: we have only heard these already mentioned previously. The three added by Ila were: one whose eyeball is round like that of a human or whose mouth is like that of a pig or if the greater part of the speaking part of the tongue has been removed. A subsequent court ruled however: each of these cases is a disqualifying blemish.","94":"It happened that the lower jaw of a first born was larger than the upper jaw. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel asked the sages for a ruling and they said: this is a blemish. The ear of a kid which was doubled: the sages ruled: if it is all one bone, it is a blemish, but if it is not all one bone, it is not a blemish. Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel says: if the tail of a kid is like that of a pig, or if the tail does not possess three vertebrae, this is a blemish.","95":"Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: if a first born has a wart in its eye or if a bone of its fore-leg or hind-leg is defective, or if the bone of the mouth split, or one eye is large and the other small, or one ear is large and the other small, being visibly so and not merely in measurement all of these are blemishes. Rabbi Judah says: if one testicle is as large as two of the other this is a blemish. But the sages didn\u2019t agree with him.","96":"If the tail of a calf does not reach the joint, it is a blemish. The sages said: the growth of all calves is in this manner, as long as the animals grow, the tails also extend below. To which joint does this refer? Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: the joint in the middle of the hip. In consequence of these blemishes we may slaughter a firstborn animal, and consecrated animals rendered unfit for the altar in consequence of these blemishes may be redeemed.","97":"And in consequence of the following blemishes one may not slaughter a first born either in the Temple or in the rest of the state: White spots on the cornea and water dripping from the eye which are not permanent, Or molars which have been broken but not torn out completely; Or an animal affected with garav, a wart, or hazazit. An old animal or a sick one, an animal of offensive smell; Or an animal which with a transgression has been committed or an animal which is known to have killed a human being on the testimony of one witness or of the owners. A tumtum or a hermaphrodite cannot be slaughtered, neither in the Temple or in the rest of the state. Rabbi Ishmael however says: there is no greater blemish than that of a hermaphrodite. But the sages say: it is not considered a first-born and it may be shorn and worked with.","98":"These blemishes named above, whether permanent or transitory, make human beings unfit to serve in the Temple. There are more than this concerning human beings: kilon, liftan, makkaban, one whose head is angular or shekifas . A hunchback: Rabbi Judah considers him fit, Whereas the sages consider him unfit.","99":"A bald-headed person is unfit for the priesthood. What is considered bald-headed? One who does not have a line of hair from ear to ear. If he has one, then he is fit. One who has no eyebrows or has only one eyebrow is unfit, this being the gibben mentioned in the Torah. Rabbi Dosa says: one whose eyebrows lie flat overshadowing the eyes. Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: one who has a double back or a double spine.","100":"A harum is unfit for the priesthood. What is a harum? One who can paint both of his eyes with one movement. If both of his eyes were above or both of his eyes were below; or if one one eye was above and the other below; Or one who sees the room and the ceiling in one glance; Or one who covers his eyes from the sun; A zugdos and a tziran. One whose eyelashes have fallen off is unfit for the priesthood for appearance sake.","101":"One whose eyes are as large as a calf's or as small as those of a goose; Or whose body is unduly large for his limbs, unduly small for his limbs; or whose nose is unduly large for his limbs, or whose nose is unduly small for his limbs; A tzimem and a zimea. What is tzimea? One whose ears are very small. What is tzimem? One whose ears resemble a sponge.","102":"If the upper lip overlaps the lower or the lower lip overlaps the upper, behold this is a blemish. One whose teeth have fallen out is unfit for the priesthood for appearance sake. If his breasts hang down like those of a woman, or his belly is swollen, or his navel sticks out, or if he is epileptic, even once every few days, or he is subject to melancholy, a me'ushkan and a ba'al gever all these are unfit for the priesthood. If he has no testicles, or only one testicle, this is the \u201cmeroah ashekh\u201d mentioned in the Torah. Rabbi Ishmael says: anyone whose testicles were crushed. Rabbi Akiva says: anyone who has wind in his testicles. Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: one who has a black complexion.","103":"If one knocks his ankles against each other, in walking or rubs his legs against each other; a ba\u2019al pikah and an ikkel. What is an ikkel? One whose knees do not touch each other when he puts his feet together. If he has a lump protruding from his thumb, or if his heel projects backward, or if his feet are wide like those of a goose. Or if his fingers lie one above the other. If they are webbed up to the joint, he is fit, if below the root, if he cuts it, he is also fit. If he has an additional finger and he cut it off, if there was a bone in it, he is unfit, but if not, he is fit. If he has additional fingers and additional toes, on each hand and foot six fingers and six toes, making altogether twenty-four fingers and toes: Rabbi Judah declares him fit, But the sages declare him unfit. One who has equal strength in both hands: Rabbi declares him unfit; But the sages declare him fit. A kushi, a gihur, a lavkan, a kippeah, a dwarf, a deaf-mute, an imbecile, one intoxicated, or afflicted with plague marks which are clean \u2013 these defects disqualify in human beings but not in animals. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: a mad animal is not a choice sacrifice. Rabbi Eliezer says: also those afflicted with dangling warts they are unfit in human beings but are fit in animals.","104":"The following are fit in the case of human beings, but unfit in the case of animals:A father with his son, A terefah; One born by means of a caesarean section. One with which a sin has been committed or has killed a person; A priest who contracts an illegal marriage is unfit for the priesthood until he vows not to derive any benefit from the woman. One who makes himself unclean through contact with the dead is unfit, until he undertakes that he will no longer make himself unclean through the dead.","105":"There is one who is counted as a firstborn with respect to inheritance but not with respect to redemption from a priest; a firstborn with respect to redemption from a priest but not a firstborn with respect to inheritance; a firstborn with respect to both inheritance and redemption from a priest; and a firstborn in respect to neither inheritance nor redemption from a priest. Which is a firstborn with respect to inheritance but not to redemption from a priest? One which follows one which was not viable whose head came forth alive, or one born in the ninth month whose head came out dead, or when a woman aborts something that looks like an animal, beast or bird, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: it is not considered an opening of the womb until the abortion has the form of a human being. If a woman aborts a sandal or a placenta or a fetus having an articulated shape, or if an embryo came out by pieces, the infant which follows after them is a first-born with respect to inheritance but not a first-born for redemption from a priest. If one who never had children married a woman who had already given birth, even if she had given birth when she was a slave but is now free, or had given birth when she was a non-Jew but has since converted, if after coming to the Israelite she gave birth, the infant is considered a first-born with respect to inheritance but not a first-born for redemption from a priest. Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: the infant is a firstborn with respect to inheritance and for redemption from a priest, as it says: \u201cWhatever opens the womb in Israel\u201d (Exodus 13:2), meaning only if it opens the womb in Israel. If one had children already and married a woman who had never given birth previously Or if she converted when pregnant, or if she was freed when pregnant, and she gave birth; If she and a priestess gave birth, she and a Levite\u2019s daughter, she and a woman who had already given birth; And similarly if a woman who did not wait three months after her husband's death, married and gave birth and it is not known if the infant was born in the ninth month since the death of the first husband or in the seventh month since she married the second, it is a firstborn for redemption from a priest but not a first-born with respect to inheritance. Which is a firstborn both in respect of inheritance and for redemption from a priest? If a woman miscarries a sac full of blood or full of water or full of pieces of flesh; or if a woman miscarries something with the shape of fish or locusts or reptiles, or creeping things, or if she discharges on the fortieth day of conception, the infant which follows after these discharges is a firstborn both in respect of inheritance and for redemption from a priest.","106":"A fetus extracted by means of a caesarean section and one that follows neither is a first-born for inheritance or a first-born to be redeemed from a priest. Rabbi Shimon says: the first is a first-born for inheritance and the second is a first-born as regards the redemption with five selas.","107":"If a man's wife had never before given birth and she gave birth to two males, he gives five sela's to the priest. If one of them dies within thirty days of birth the father is exempt. If the father dies and the sons survive: Rabbi Meir says: if they gave the five sela's before the property was divided up, then what they gave is given; but if not, they are exempt. But Rabbi Judah says: there is a claim on the property. If she gave birth to a male and a female, the priest receives nothing.","108":"Two women who had never before given birth gave birth to two males: he the father gives ten selas to the priest. If one of the children dies within thirty days of its birth, if he gave the redemption money to one priest alone, he returns five selas to him, but if he gave it to two priests, he cannot reclaim the money from them. If they gave birth to a male and a female or to two males and a female, he gives five selas to the priest. If they gave birth to two females and a male, or to two males and two females, the priest receives nothing. If one woman had given birth before and the other had never given birth, and they gave birth to two males, he gives five selas to the priest. If one of the children died within thirty days of its birth, the father is exempt. If the father dies and the sons survive: Rabbi Meir says: if they gave the five sela's before the property was divided up, then what they gave is given; but if not, they are exempt. But Rabbi Judah says: there is a claim on the property. If they gave birth to a male and a female, the priest receives nothing.","109":"If two women who had never before given birth married two men and gave birth to two males, the one father gives five selas to the priest and the other gives five selas to the priest. If one of the children died within thirty days of its birth, if they gave the redemption money to one priest alone, he returns five selas to them, but if they gave the money to two priests, they are not able to recover it from them. If they gave birth to a male and a female, the fathers are exempt, whereas the son must redeem himself as in any case he is a first-born. If they gave birth to two females and a male or to two females and two males, the priest receives nothing.","110":"If one woman had given birth before and the other had never before given birth, the two women belonging to two husbands, and they gave birth to two males, the one whose wife had never before given birth gives five selas to the priest. If they gave birth to a male and a female, the priest receives nothing. If the son dies within thirty days although he gave the priest the five selas, he must return them. If he dies after thirty days, although he has not yet given the five selas, he must give them. If he dies on the thirtieth day, it is as if he died on the previous day. But Rabbi Akiva says: if he gave the five selas he cannot reclaim them, but if he had not yet given, he need not give. If the father dies within thirty days, the infant is under the presumption of not having been redeemed until proof is brought that he has been redeemed. If the father dies after thirty days, the infant is under the presumption of having been redeemed until he the son is told that he was not redeemed. If both he and his son need to be redeemed, the father takes precedence over his son. Rabbi Judah says: his son comes first for the command to redeem him was upon his father, and the command of his son is upon him.","111":"The five selas of a first-born are paid in the standard of Tyrian maneh. As regards the thirty shekels of a slave and likewise the fifty shekels of the rapist and seducer and the one hundred shekels for one who spreads an evil name    in all these cases the payment is in the holy shekel, in the standard of Tyrian maneh. All of these are redeemed with money or the equivalent of money with the exception of shekel payments.","112":"We must not redeem a first-born with slaves, nor with notes of indebtedness, nor with immovable properties, nor with objects of hekdesh. If one gives a written acknowledgment to a priest that he owes him five selas he is bound to give them to him, although his son is not considered as redeemed. Therefore, if the priest wishes to give him the note of indebtedness as a gift he is permitted to do so. If one set aside the redemption money of his son and it became lost, he is responsible for it, because it says: \u201cShall be for you but you shall surely redeem\u201d (Numbers 18:15).","113":"The first-born takes a double share of the father's estate but he does not take a double share of the mother\u2019s estate. He also does not take a double share of the improvement in the value of the estate. Nor from what will fall due to the estate as he does of what is held in possession. Nor can a woman claim with her ketubah from these, Nor can daughters claim their support. Nor can a yavam make a claim from these. None of these take from the improvement in the value of the estate, nor of what will fall to the estate as they do of what is now held in possession.","114":"The following do not return to their owners in Jubilee year: The share of the first-born, The inheritance of one who inherits his wife's estate And of one who performs yibbum with his sister-in-law And a present, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: a present is like a sale. Rabbi Elazar says: all of these return in the Jubilee. R. Johanan ben Berokah says: if one inherits his wife's estate, he returns it to the members of the family and he deducts from the purchase money.","115":"The law concerning the tithe of cattle is in force in the Land and outside the Land, in the days when the Temple exists and when it does not exist, It applies to hullin animals only but not to consecrated animals. It applies both to cattle and flock animals, but they are not tithed together. To lambs and to goats, and they are tithed together. To the new and the old, but they are not tithed together. Now it might be logical: seeing that new and old animals which are not treated as kilayim in regard to one another are yet not tithed one for the other, lambs and goats which are treated as kilyaim in regard to one another, all the more should not be tithed one for the other. Scripture therefore states: \u201cAnd of the flock\u201d all kinds of flock are considered one for purposes of tithing.","116":"Animals are combined for purposes of tithing so long as they can still pasture within the distance that cattle wander. And what is the distance over which they wander while pasturing? Sixteen mils. If there was between two groups of animals a distance of thirty-two mils, they do not combine for the purpose of tithing. If however there was one in the middle of the distance of thirty-two mils he brings them into the middle and tithes them. Rabbi Meir says: the river Jordan is regarded as forming a division as regards the tithing of animals.","117":"An animal bought or given as a present is exempt from the law of cattle tithe. If brothers became partners, though they are still bound to pay the kalbon surcharge, they are exempt from the tithe of cattle. And when they become liable to tithe of cattle, they are exempt from paying the kalbon. If they acquired from the estate, they are bound to tithe them. But if not, they are exempt from tithing. If they first divided up the estate and then again became partners, they are bound to pay the kalbon and are exempt from tithe of cattle.","118":"All domesticated animals enter the shed to be tithed except kilayim, a terefah, offspring brought forth by means of a caesarean section, an animal too young for sacrifice, and an \u201corphan\u201d. And what is an \u201corphan\u201d? When its mother has died during its birth or was slaughtered and subsequently gave birth. But Rabbi Joshua says: even if the mother has been killed, if the hide is still intact the offspring is not an \u2018orphan\u2019 animal.","119":"There are three periods lit. threshing floors for the tithe of cattle: in the peras of Pesah, in the peras of Atzeret and in the peras of the Feast of Sukkot, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Ben Azzai says: on the twenty-ninth of Adar, on the first of Sivan and on the twenty-ninth of Av. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: on the first of Nisan, on the first of Sivan and on the twenty-ninth of Elul. And why did they say the twenty-ninth of Elul and not the first of Tishrei? Because it is a Yom Tov and you cannot tithe on a Yom Tov. Consequently they moved it up to the twenty-ninth of Elul. Rabbi Meir says: the first of Elul is the New Year for the tithe of cattle. Ben Azzai says: those born in Elul are tithed by themselves.","120":"All those born from the first of Tishrei until the twenty-ninth of Elul combine for matters of tithing. Five lambs born before Rosh Hashanah and five born after Rosh Hashanah do not combine. But five lambs born before the period of tithing and five after the period of tithing do combine for tithing. If so, why did they speak of three periods for the tithe of cattle? Until the arrival of the tithing period it is permitted to sell and slaughter the animals, but when the period has arrived he must not kill, but if he killed, he is exempt.","121":"How does one tithe animals? He brings them to a shed and makes for them a small opening so that two cannot go out at the same time. And he counts them with a rod: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. And the one that comes out tenth he marks with red chalk and he says: \u201cBehold, this is the tithe.\u201d If he did not mark it, or if he did not count them with a rod, or if he counted them while they were crouching or standing, they are still considered tithed. If he had one hundred lambs and he took ten or if he had ten and he took one without counting, this is not a valid tithe. Rabbi Yose bar Judah says: this is a valid tithe. If one of the lambs already counted jumped back into the flock in the shed they are all exempt. If one of the lambs that was a tithe jumped back into the flock in the shed, they all go to pasture until they become unfit for sacrifice, and the owners may eat them in their unfit state.","122":"If two lambs came out at the same time, he counts them in pairs. If he counted the two as one, the ninth and the tenth are spoiled. If the ninth and the tenth came out at the same time, the ninth and the tenth are spoiled. If he called the ninth the tenth, the tenth the ninth and the eleventh the tenth, all three are holy: the ninth can be eaten when it becomes blemished, the tenth is the tithe and the eleventh is sacrificed as a shelamim, and it can make a substitute, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah said: can one substitute make another substitute? They said in the name of Rabbi Meir: if it were a substitute, it would not have been sacrificed. If he called the ninth the tenth, the tenth the tenth and the eleventh the tenth, the eleventh is not holy. The following is the rule: wherever the name of the tenth animal has not been taken away from it, the eleventh is not consecrated.","123":"All may slaughter, and their slaughtering is valid, except a deaf-mute, an imbecile or a minor, lest they mess up the animal through their slaughtering. And if any of these slaughtered while others were standing over them, their slaughtering is valid. That which is slaughtered by a non-Jew is a nevelah and defiles by carrying. If one slaughtered at night, and also a blind man that slaughtered, the slaughtering is valid. One who slaughtered on Shabbat or Yom Kippur, even though he is liable for his own life, the slaughtering is valid.","124":"If one slaughtered with the smooth edge of a hand sickle, with a flint or with a reed, the slaughtering is valid. All may slaughter; at all times one may slaughter; and with any implement one may slaughter, except a scythe, a saw, teeth or a finger nail, since these strangle. One who slaughtered with a scythe, moving it forward only: Bet Shammai declare it invalid, But Bet Hillel declare it valid. If the teeth of the scythe were filed away it is regarded as an ordinary knife.","125":"If one slaughtered by cutting at the top ring of the trachea and left a hair's breadth of its entire circumference towards the head, the slaughtering is valid. Rabbi Yose son of Rabbi Judah says: if there was only left towards the head a hair's breadth of the greater part of its circumference, the slaughtering is valid.","126":"If one cut at the side of the neck, the slaughtering is valid. If one nipped off the head of a bird sacrifice from the side of the neck, the nipping is invalid. If one cut at the back of the neck, the slaughtering is invalid. If one nipped off the head from the back of the neck, the nipping is valid. If one cut at the front of the neck, the slaughtering is valid. If one nipped off the head from the front of the neck, the nipping is invalid. For the whole of the back of the neck is the appropriate place for nipping, and the whole of the front of the neck is the appropriate place for slaughtering. It follows, therefore, that the place which is appropriate for slaughtering is inappropriate for nipping, and the place which is appropriate for nipping is inappropriate for slaughtering.","127":"The age which qualifies turtle doves for sacrifice disqualifies pigeons, and the age which qualifies pigeons for sacrifice disqualifies turtle doves. At the period when the neck feathers begin to turn yellow in either kind they are disqualified.","128":"The method of killing which renders the red cow valid renders the heifer invalid, and the method which renders the heifer valid renders the red cow invalid. The disability which does not disqualify priests disqualifies Levites, and the disability which does not disqualify Levites disqualifies priests. That which cannot be rendered unclean in earthenware vessels can be rendered unclean in all other vessels, and that which cannot be rendered unclean in all other vessels can be rendered unclean in earthenware vessels. That which cannot be rendered unclean in wooden things can be rendered unclean in metal things, and that which cannot be rendered unclean in metal things can be rendered unclean in wooden things. When bitter almonds are subject to tithing sweet almonds are exempt, and when sweet almonds are subject to tithing bitter almonds are exempt.","129":"Temed: Before it has fermented it may not be bought with second tithe money and it renders a mikveh invalid; After it has fermented it may be bought with second tithe money and it does not render a mikveh invalid. Brothers who are partners in their inheritance: When they are liable to pay the kalbon, they are exempt from the cattle tithe, And when they are liable to the cattle tithe, they are exempt from the kalbon. Whenever there is the power to sell, there is no fine, and whenever there is a fine there is no power to sell. Whenever there is the right of refusal there can be no halizah, and whenever there can be halizah there is no longer the right of refusal. When the shofar is blown there is no havdalah, and when there is habdalah the shofar is not blown. Thus, if a festival falls on the day before Shabbat the shofar is blown but there is no havdalah; If it falls on the day following Shabbat there is havdalah but the shofar is not blown. How do they recite havdalah on a festival that follows Shabbat? \u201cWho distinguishes between holy and holy.\u201d Rabbi Dosa says: \u201cWho distinguishes between the more holy and less holy day.\u201d","130":"If one cut one of the organs of the throat in the case of a bird, or both organs in the case of cattle, the slaughtering is valid. The greater part of an organ is equivalent to the whole of it. Rabbi Judah says: he must cut through the veins. If one cut half of one organ in the case of a bird, or one and a half organs in the case of cattle, the slaughtering is invalid. If one man cut the greater part of one organ in the case of a bird, or the greater part of each organ in the case of cattle, the slaughtering is valid.","131":"If one slaughtered two animals simultaneously, the slaughtering is valid. If two persons held the knife and slaughtered, even if one cut higher up and the other cut lower down in the neck, the slaughtering is valid.","132":"If he chopped off the head with one stroke, the slaughtering is invalid. He was slaughtering and he cut through the neck with one stroke, if the knife was as long as the neck, the slaughtering is valid. If he was slaughtering and he cut off two heads at the same time, if the knife is as long as the neck it is valid. When is this so? When the slaughterer moved the knife forward and not backward, or backward and not forward; but if he moved the knife to and fro, however small it was, even if it was a scalpel, the slaughtering is valid. If a knife fell down and slaughtered an animal, even though it slaughtered it in the proper way, the slaughtering is invalid, for it is said, \"And you shall slaughter and eat,\" that which you slaughter, you may eat. If while slaughtering the knife fell and he picked it up, if his clothes fell and he picked them up, if he sharpened the knife, or if he got tired and his friend came and continued slaughtering, if he delayed the time that it takes to slaughter, it is invalid. Rabbi Shimon says: if he delayed the time it takes to examine the slaughtering.","133":"If one first sliced the esophagus and then cut away the windpipe, or first cut away the windpipe and then sliced the esophagus; or if he sliced one of these organs and paused until the animal died; or if he thrust the knife underneath the second organ and cut it: In all these cases Rabbi Yeshevav says: the animal is nevelah; Rabbi Akiva says: it is terefah. Rabbi Yeshevav stated this general rule in the name of Rabbi Joshua: whenever an animal is rendered invalid by a fault in the slaughtering it is nevelah; whenever an animal has been duly slaughtered but is rendered invalid by some other defect it is terefah. And Rabbi Akiba ultimately agreed with him.","134":"If one slaughtered cattle or a wild beast or a bird and no blood came out, they are valid and may be eaten by him whose hands have not been washed, for they have not been rendered susceptible to impurity by blood. Rabbi Shimon says: they have been rendered susceptible to impurity by the slaughtering.","135":"One who slaughtered a dying animal: Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: the slaughtering is invalid unless it jerked its foreleg and its hind leg. Rabbi Eliezer says: it is enough if it spurted the blood. Rabbi Shimon said: even if one slaughtered a dying animal by night and the following morning he got up early and found the sides of the throat full of blood, the slaughtering is valid, for this proves that it spurted the blood, as is Rabbi Eliezer's measure. The sages say: the slaughtering is invalid unless it jerked either its foreleg or its hind leg, or it moved its tail to and fro. This is the test both with regard to large and small animals. If a small animal stretched out its foreleg at the end of the slaughtering but did not withdraw it, the slaughtering is invalid, for this was just an indication of the expiration of its life. When do these rules apply? To case of an animal which was believed to be dying. But if it was believed to be sound, even though it did not show any of these signs, the slaughtering is valid.","136":"If one slaughtered for a non-Jew, the slaughtering is valid. Rabbi Eliezer declares it invalid. Rabbi Eliezer said: even if one slaughtered a beast with the intention that a non-Jew should eat only its liver, the slaughtering is invalid, for the thoughts of a non-Jew are usually directed towards idolatry. Rabbi Yose said: is there not a kal vehomer argument? For if in the case of consecrated animals, where a wrongful intention can render invalid, it is established that everything depends solely upon the intention of him who performs the service, how much more in the case of unconsecrated animals, where a wrongful intention cannot render invalid, is it not logical that everything should depend solely upon the intention of him who slaughters!","137":"If one slaughtered an animal as a sacrifice to mountains, hills, seas, rivers, or deserts, the slaughtering is invalid. If two persons held a knife and slaughtered an animal, one intending it as a sacrifice to one of these things and the other for a legitimate purpose, the slaughtering is invalid.","138":"One may not slaughter so that the blood runs into the sea or into rivers, or into vessels, But one may slaughter into a pool of water. And when on board a ship on to vessels. One may not slaughter at all into a hole, but one may dig a hole in his own house for the blood to run into. In the street, however, he should not do so as not to follow the ways of the heretics.","139":"If one slaughtered an unconsecrated animal outside the Temple court for it to be an olah or a shelamim or an asham for a doubtful sin or as a Pesah or a todah, the slaughtering is invalid. But Rabbi Shimon declares it valid. If two persons held one knife and slaughtered an unconsecrated animal outside the Temple court, one declaring it to be one of the above and the other intending it for a legitimate purpose, the slaughtering is invalid. If one slaughtered an unconsecrated animal outside the Temple court for it to be a hatat or an asham or a first-born or the tithe of cattle or a substitute offering, the slaughtering is valid. This is the general rule: if one slaughtered an animal declaring it to be a sacrifice which can be brought either as a voluntary or a freewill-offering it is invalid, but if he declares it to be a sacrifice which cannot be brought either as a votive or a freewill-offering it is valid.","140":"The following defects render cattle terefah:If the esophagus was pierced; If the windpipe severed; If the membrane of the brain was pierced; If the heart was pierced as far as its cavity thereof; If the spine was broken and the cord severed; If the liver was gone and none of it remained; If the lung was pierced, Or if part of it was missing Rabbi Shimon says: only if it was pierced as far as the main bronchi; If the stomach, If the gall-bladder was pierced, If the intestines were pierced; If the innermost stomach was pierced, If the greater part of the outer stomach was pierced. Rabbi Judah says: in a large animal if it was torn to the extent of a handbreadth, and in a small animal the greater part. If the omasum was pierced; Of if the second stomach was pierced on the outside; If the animal fell from the roof; If most of its ribs were fractured; Or if it was mauled by a wolf Rabbi Judah says: small animals are terefah if mauled by a wolf, large cattle if mauled by a lion; small fowl if mauled by a hawk, large fowl if mauled by a falcon. This is the rule: if an animal with a similar defect could not continue to live, it is terefah.","141":"And the following defects do not render cattle terefah:If the windpipe was pierced, or cracked lengthwise. To what extent may it be deficient? Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: up to an Italian issar. If the skull was cracked but the membrane of the brain was not pierced; If the heart was pierced but not as far as its cavity; If the spine was broken but the cord was not severed; If the liver was removed but an olive's size of it remained. If the omasum or the third stomach were pierced at their juncture; If the spleen was removed, or the kidneys, or the lower jaw-bone or the womb. If the lung was shrunken up by an act of Heaven. If an animal was stripped of its hide: Rabbi Meir declares it valid But the rabbis declare it invalid.","142":"The following defects render birds terefah:If the esophagus was pierced, If the windpipe was severed; If a weasel struck the bird on the head in such a place as would render it terefah. If the gizzard was pierced If the intestines were pierced. If it fell into the fire and its innards were scorched: If they turned green, it is invalid, But if they remained red it is valid. If one trod upon it or knocked it against a wall or if an animal trampled upon it, and it still jerks its limbs, and it remained alive after this for twenty-four hours, and it was thereafter slaughtered, it is valid.","143":"And the following defects do not render birds terefah:If the windpipe was pierced or cracked lengthwise; If a weasel struck it on the head in such a place as would not render it terefah. If the crop was pierced Rabbi says: even if it was gone. If the innards protruded from the body but were not pierced. If its wings were broken, or its legs; or if the wing\u2019s feathers were plucked. Rabbi Judah says: if its down was gone it is invalid.","144":"If an animal suffered from congestion of the blood, or was overcome by smoke or by a cold, or if it ate oleander or chicken dung, or if it drank noxious water, it is permitted. If it ate poison or was bitten by a snake, it is not forbidden as trefah but it is forbidden as a danger to life.","145":"The characteristics of cattle and of wild animals are stated in the Torah. The characteristics of birds are not stated, but the sages said: every bird that seizes its prey is unclean. Every bird that has an extra toe, or a crop and a gizzard that can be peeled, is clean. Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says: every bird that parts its toes is unclean.","146":"Of locusts: all that have four legs, four wings, leaping legs, and wings covering the greater part of the body, are clean. Rabbi Yose says: its name must be locust. Of fishes: all that have fins and scales are clean. Rabbi Judah says: there must be at least two scales and one fin. The scales are those which are immovable, the fins are those wings by which it swims.","147":"If an animal was having difficulty giving birth and the fetus put forth a limb and then put it back in, it may be eaten when its mother is slaughtered. If it put forth its head, even though it put it back in, it is considered as born. Whatever is cut off from the fetus within the womb and left inside may be eaten, but whatever is cut off from the spleen or kidneys of the animal and left inside may not be eaten. This is the rule: that which is from the body of the animal is forbidden, but that which is not from the body of the animal is permitted.","148":"If an animal giving birth for the first time was having difficulty, one may cut off each limb as it comes out and throw it to the dogs. If the greater portion came forth it must be buried, and she is exempt from the law of the firstling.","149":"If a fetus died within the womb of its mother and the shepherd put in his hand and touched it, he is clean, whether it was a clean or unclean animal. Rabbi Yose HaGalili says: if it was an unclean animal he is unclean, and if it was a clean animal he is clean. If the fetus of a woman died within the womb of its mother and the midwife put in her hand and touched it, the midwife is unclean for seven days, but the mother is clean until the fetus comes out.","150":"If an animal was having difficulty in labor and the fetus put forth its limb and a person immediately cut if off and then slaughtered the mother, the flesh of the fetus is clean. If he slaughtered the mother first and then cut if off, the flesh of the fetus is unclean like that which had touched nevelah, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say, it is like that which had touched a slaughtered terefah, For just as we find that the slaughtering of a terefah animal renders it clean, so the slaughtering of the animal renders the limb clean. Rabbi Meir said to them: No, for when you say that the slaughtering of a terefah animal renders it clean you are concerned with the animal itself, but can you say that it will render clean the limb which is not part of the animal itself? From where do we learn that the slaughtering of a terefah animal renders it clean? For we could have argued to the contrary: An unclean animal may not be eaten, and a terefah also may not be eaten; just as slaughtering does not render an unclean animal clean so slaughtering should not render a terefah animal clean? No, if you said this of an unclean animal for at no time was it fit for slaughtering; can you also say this of a terefah animal which had a time when it was fit for slaughtering? Take away with this argument that you brought forth! For where would we know this of an animal that was born terefah from the womb? Substitute therefore this argument: No, if you said this of an unclean animal for none of its kind may be validly slaughtered; can you also state this of a terefah for whose kind there is valid slaughter? Accordingly, the slaughtering of a live eight months birth does not render it clean, since there is no slaughtering of its kind.","151":"If one slaughtered an animal and found in it an eight months\u2019 fetus, either living or dead, or a dead nine months fetus, he need only tear it open and take out the blood. If he found in it a living nine months\u2019 fetus it must be slaughtered, and he would thereby possibly incur the penalty for \u201cit and its young,\u201d the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: the slaughtering of its mother renders it permitted. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: even if it is eights years old and is plowing the field, the slaughtering of its mother renders it permitted. If he ripped open the mother and found in it a living nine months fetus, it must be slaughtered, since its mother has not been slaughtered.","152":"If the hind legs of an animal were cut off below the joint, it is permitted; If above the joint, it is terefah. So too if the juncture of the tendons was gone, it is terefah. If the bone was broken but the greater part of the flesh around the fracture remained, it is rendered clean by the slaughtering; Otherwise it is not rendered clean by the slaughtering.","153":"If a person slaughtered an animal and found in it an amniotic sac, he who is not fastidious may eat it. It does not contract uncleanness, either food uncleanness or the uncleanness of nevelah. If he intended to eat it, it can contract food uncleanness but not the uncleanness of nevelah. If part of the amniotic sac emerged before the slaughtering of the mother, it may not be eaten; For it is a sign of birth in a woman and also a sign of birth in an animal. If an animal which was pregnant for the first time miscarried an amniotic sac, it may be thrown to dogs. But in the case of a consecrated animal it must be buried. It may not be buried at cross-roads or hung on a tree, for these are amorite practices.","154":"The law of \u201cIt and its young\u201d applies both within the land of Israel and outside it, both during the existence of the Temple and after it, in respect of both unconsecrated and consecrated animals. How so? If a person slaughtered an animal and its young, both animals being unconsecrated, and they slaughtered them outside the sanctuary, they are both valid, but he who slaughtered the second incurs forty lashes. If both animals were consecrated and they were slaughtered outside the sanctuary, he who slaughtered the first incurs the penalty of karet, both animals are invalid, and each incurs forty lashes. If both animals were unconsecrated and they were slaughtered inside the sanctuary, both animals are invalid, and he who slaughtered the second incurs forty lashes. If both animals were consecrated and they were slaughtered inside the sanctuary, the first is valid and he who slaughtered it is not culpable, but he who slaughtered the second incurs forty lashes, and it is invalid.","155":"If the first animal was unconsecrated and the second consecrated and they were both slaughtered outside the sanctuary, the first is valid and he who slaughtered it is not liable, but he who slaughtered the second incurs forty lashes and it is invalid. If the first was consecrated and the second unconsecrated and they were both slaughtered outside the sanctuary, he who slaughtered the first incurs the penalty of karet and it is invalid, and the second animal is valid, and each incurs forty lashes. If the first was unconsecrated and the second consecrated and they were both slaughtered inside the sanctuary, they are both invalid, and he who slaughtered the second incurs forty lashes. If the first was consecrated and the second unconsecrated and they were both slaughtered inside the sanctuary, the first animal is valid and he who slaughtered it is not liable, but he who slaughtered the second incurs forty lashes and it is invalid. If both were unconsecrated and the first was slaughtered outside the sanctuary and the second inside, the first is valid and he who slaughtered it is not liable, but he who slaughtered the second incurs forty lashes and it is invalid. If both were consecrated and the first was slaughtered outside the sanctuary and the second inside, he who slaughtered the first incurs the penalty of karet, each incurs forty lashes, and both animals are invalid. If both were unconsecrated and the first was slaughtered inside the sanctuary and the second outside, the first is invalid and he who slaughtered it is not liable, but he who slaughtered the second incurs forty lashes and it is valid. If both were consecrated and the first was slaughtered inside the sanctuary and the second outside, the first is valid and he who slaughtered it is not liable, but he who slaughtered the second incurs forty lashes and it is invalid.","156":"If a person slaughtered an animal and it was found to be terefah, or if he slaughtered it as an offering to idols, or if he slaughtered the red cow, or an ox which was condemned to be stoned, or a heifer whose neck was to be broken: Rabbi  Shimon exempts him from having transgressed the law of \u201cit and its young\u201d; But the sages make him liable. If a person slaughtered an animal and it became nevelah under his hand, or if he stabbed it, or tore away the organs of the throat, he does not thereby transgress the law of it and its young. If two people bought a cow and its young, he who bought first can slaughter first; but if the second preceded him, he holds his advantage. If a person slaughtered a cow and then two of its calves, he is liable for eighty lashes. If he slaughtered its two calves and then the cow, he is liable for forty lashes. If he slaughtered it and then its calf and then the calf's offspring, he is liable for eighty lashes. If he slaughtered it and then its calf's offspring and then the calf, he is liable for forty lashes. Symmachos says in the name of r. Meir: he is liable for eighty lashes. At four periods in the year he who sells a beast to another must inform him, \u201cI sold today its mother to be slaughtered,\u201d or \u201cI sold today its young to be slaughtered,\u201d and these are they:  on the eve of the last day of the feast of Sukkot, on the eve of the first day of Pesah, on the eve of Shavuot, and on the eve of Rosh Hashanah. According to Rabbi Yose the Galilean, also on the eve of Yom Kippur, in the Galilee. Rabbi Judah says, this is so, only when there was no time in between the sales, but if there was time, he need not inform him. Rabbi Judah agrees that if he sold the mother to the bridegroom and the young to the bride, he must inform them of it, for it is certain that they will each slaughter on the same day.","157":"At these four periods a butcher can be compelled to slaughter against his will. Even if the ox was worth a thousand dinars and the purchaser has only paid a dinar, they can force the butcher to slaughter it. Therefore if the animal died, the loss is upon the purchaser. At other times of the year it is not so, therefore if the animal died, the loss is upon the seller.","158":"The \u201cone day\u201d mentioned in connection with the law of \u201cit and its young\u201d means the day and the night preceding it. This was how Rabbi Shimon ben Zoma expounded in connection with the creation and it also says \u201cone day\u201d in connection with \u201cit and its young\u201d Just as the \u201cone day\u201d mentioned in connection with the creation means the day and the night preceding it, so too the \u201cone day\u201d mentioned in connection with \u201cit and its young\u201d means the day and the night preceding it.","159":"The law of \u201ccovering up the blood\u201d applies both within the land of Israel and outside it, both during the existence of the Temple and after it, It applies to unconsecrated animal, but not consecrated animals. It applies only to wild animals and birds, whether they are at one's disposal or not. It applies also to a koy, for it is an animal about which there is a doubt. It may therefore not be slaughtered on a festival; and if it was slaughtered on a festival one may not cover up its blood.","160":"If a person slaughtered a wild animal or a bird and it was found to be terefah, or if he slaughtered it as an offering to idols, or if he slaughtered that which was unconsecrated inside the sanctuary or that which was consecrated outside, or if he slaughtered a wild animal or a bird that was condemned to be stoned: Rabbi Meir makes him liable to cover up the blood; But the sages make him exempt. If he slaughtered a wild animal or a bird and it became nevelah under his hand, or if he stabbed it, or tore away the organs of the throat, he is exempt from covering up the blood.","161":"If a deaf-mute, an imbecile or a minor slaughtered while others watched them, one must cover up the blood; But if they were alone, they are exempt from covering it up. Similarly for the matter of \u201cit and its young\u201d: if they slaughtered while others watched them, it is forbidden to slaughter after them the mother\/young, But if they were alone: Rabbi Meir permits to slaughter after them the mother\/young. But the rabbis forbid it. They agree, that if a person did slaughter after them, he has not incurred forty lashes.","162":"If a person slaughtered a hundred wild animals in one place, one covering suffices for all. If he slaughtered a hundred birds in one place, one covering suffices for all. If he slaughtered a wild animal and a bird in one place, one covering suffices for both. Rabbi Judah says: if he slaughtered a wild animal he should cover up its blood and then slaughter the bird and cover it up also. If a person slaughtered and did not cover up the blood and another person saw it, the other must cover it up. If he covered it up and it became uncovered, he need not cover it up again. If the wind covered it up, he must cover it up again.","163":"If the blood became mixed with water and it still has the color of blood, it must be covered up. If it became mixed with wine, the wine is to be regarded as though it was water. If it became mixed with the blood of a beast or with the blood of a wild animal, it is to be regarded as though it was water. Rabbi Judah says: blood does not annul other blood.","164":"The blood which spurted out and that which is upon the knife must also be covered up. Rabbi Judah says: when is this the case? When there is no other blood but that; but when there is other blood besides this, it need not be covered up.","165":"With what may one cover up the blood and with what may one not cover it up?One may cover it up with fine dung, with fine sand, with lime, with white clay, or a brick or an earthenware stopper of a cask that have been ground into powder. But one may not cover it up with coarse dung or coarse sand, or with a brick or an earthenware stopper of a cask that have not been ground into powder. Nor may one cover it with a vessel. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel stated a general rule: one may cover it with anything in which plants would grow; but one may not cover it with anything in which plants would not grow.","166":"The prohibition of the sciatic nerve is in force both within the land and outside it, both during the existence of the Temple and after it, in respect of both unconsecrated and consecrated animals. It applies to cattle and to wild animals, to the right and left hip. But it does not apply to a bird because it does not have a socket on its hip. It applies to a fetus. Rabbi Judah says: it does not apply to a fetus. And its forbidden fat is permitted. Butchers are not trustworthy with regard to the removal of the sciatic nerve, the words of Rabbi Meir. The sages say: they are trustworthy with regard to it as well as with regard to the forbidden fat.","167":"One may send to a non-Jew a thigh in which the sciatic nerve has not been removed, because its place is known. When a person removes the sciatic nerve he must remove all of it. Rabbi Judah says: only so much as is necessary to fulfill the mitzvah of removing it.","168":"If a person ate an olive\u2019s bulk of the sciatic nerve, he incurs forty stripes. If he ate all of it and it was not as much as an olive's bulk, he is liable. If he ate an olive\u2019s bulk of it from one thigh and another olive\u2019s bulk of it from the other thigh, he incurs eighty stripes. Rabbi Judah says: he incurs only forty stripes.","169":"If a thigh was cooked together with the sciatic nerve and there was enough of the nerve as to impart a flavor to the thigh, it is forbidden. How does one measure this? As if it were meat cooked with turnips.","170":"A sciatic nerve which was cooked with other permitted nerves: If it can still be recognized, then all the nerves are prohibited if the sciatic nerve imparts a flavor. But if it can no longer be recognized then they are all forbidden. And the broth is prohibited if it the sciatic nerve imparts a flavor. And so it is with a piece of nevelah, or a piece of an unclean fish that was cooked together with other pieces of flesh or fish: If it can still be recognized, then all are prohibited if it imparts a flavor. But if it can no longer be recognized then they are all forbidden. And the broth is prohibited if it the sciatic nerve imparts a flavor.","171":"It applies to clean animals but not to unclean. Rabbi Judah says, even to unclean animals. Rabbi Judah said: was not the sciatic nerve prohibited from the time of the sons of Jacob, and at that time unclean animals were still permitted to them? They replied, this law was ordained at Sinai but was written in its proper place.","172":"Every kind of flesh is forbidden to be cooked in milk, except for the flesh of fish and of locusts. And it is also forbidden to place it upon the table with cheese, except for the flesh of fish and of locusts. One who vows not to eat meat, he is allowed to eat the flesh of fish and locusts. Fowl may be placed upon the table together with cheese but may not be eaten with it, the words of Bet Shammai. Bet Hillel say: it may neither be placed upon the table together with cheese nor eaten with it. Rabbi Yose said: this is one of the leniencies of Bet shammai and the stringencies of Bet Hillel . Concerning what table did they speak? Concerning the table upon which one eats; but on the table whereon the food is set out one may place the one beside the other, and not be concerned.","173":"A person may wrap up meat and cheese in one cloth, provided they do not touch one another. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: two people at an inn may eat at the same table, the one meat and the other cheese, without concern.","174":"If a drop of milk fell on a piece of meat and it imparted a flavor into that piece, it is forbidden. If he stirred up the pot, then it is forbidden only if the drop of milk imparted a flavor into all that was in the pot. The udder: he must cut it open and empty it of its milk; If he did not cut it open he has not transgressed the law on its account. The heart: he must cut it open and empty it of its blood; If he did not cut it open he has not transgressed the law on its account. One who puts fowl onto a table with cheese has not transgressed a negative commandment.","175":"It is forbidden to cook the meat of a clean animal in the milk of a clean animal or to derive any benefit from it. But it is permitted to cook the meat of a clean animal in the milk of an unclean animal or the meat of an unclean animal in the milk of a clean animal and to derive benefit from it. Rabbi Akiva says: wild animals and fowls are not included in the prohibition of the Torah, for it is written three times, \u201cYou shall not seethe a kid in its mother's milk;\u201d to exclude wild animals, fowl, and unclean animals. Rabbi Yose the Galilean says, it is said, \u201cYou shall not eat any nevelah\u201d and in the same verse it says, \u201cYou shall not seethe a kid in its mother's milk\u201d anything that is prohibited because of nevelah it is forbidden to cook in milk. Fowl which is prohibited because of nevelah, it might also be forbidden to cook in milk, Scripture says, \u201cIn its mother\u2019s milk;\u201d this excludes fowl which has no mother's milk.","176":"The milk in the stomach of an animal of a Gentile or in the stomach of a nevelah is forbidden. If a man curdled milk with the skin of the stomach of an animal that was validly slaughtered and it imparted its flavor to the milk it is forbidden. The milk in the stomach of a validly slaughtered animal which had suckled from a terefah animal is forbidden. The milk in the stomach of a terefah animal which had suckled from a kosher animal is permitted, because the milk is collected inside.","177":"In certain respects the prohibition of the fat is stricter than the prohibition of the blood, and in certain respects the prohibition of the blood is stricter than the prohibition of the fat. The prohibition of the fat is stricter, in that the fat is subject to the law of sacrilege, and one is obligated over it for piggul, notar, and uncleanness which is not the case with the blood. And the prohibition of the blood is stricter, for it applies to cattle, wild animals and fowl, whether clean or unclean; but the prohibition of the fat applies to clean cattle only.","178":"The hide, meat juice, sediment, dried-up meat, bones, sinews, horns and hooves join together to make up the minimum quantity in order to convey food-uncleanness, but not to make up the minimum quantity in order to convey nevelah-uncleanness. Similarly, if a man slaughtered an unclean animal for a Gentile and it still has convulsions, it can convey food-uncleanness, but it conveys nevelah-uncleanness only after it is dead, or its head has been chopped off. Scripture has thus made more cases that convey food-uncleanness than those that convey nevelah-uncleanness. Rabbi Judah says: if an olive\u2019s bulk of dried-up meat was gathered in one place, one would thereby become liable for nevelah-uncleanness.","179":"In the following cases the skin is considered flesh: The skin of a person, The skin of the domesticated pig. Rabbi Yose says: even the skin of the wild pig. The skin of the hump of a young camel. The skin of the head of a young calf. The skin around the hooves. The skin of the pudenda. The skin of a fetus. The skin beneath the fat tail. The skin of the gecko, the monitor, the lizard and the skink. Rabbi Judah says: the lizard is like the weasel. If any of these skins was tanned or trampled upon as much as was usual for tanning, it becomes clean, excepting the skin of a man. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: the eight reptiles have real skins.","180":"One who was flaying cattle or wild animals, clean or unclean, small or large: In order to use the hide for a covering, if he stripped as can be taken hold of the hide is no longer considered as connected to the flesh. In order to make a water-skin, until the breast has been flayed. If he was flaying from the feet upwards, until the whole hide has been flayed. All of these measures apply for both conveying uncleanness and becoming unclean. As for the skin that is on the neck: Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: it is not connected. But the sages say it is connected until the whole hide has been flayed.","181":"A hide which had an olive\u2019s bulk of unclean flesh clinging to it, one who touches a shred hanging from it, or a hair that was opposite to it, he becomes unclean. If there were two pieces of flesh attached to it, each the size of half an olive, they convey uncleanness by carrying but not by contact, the words of Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: neither by contact nor by carrying. Rabbi Akiva agrees that if there were two pieces of flesh, each the size of half of an olive, that he stuck on a twig and he waved them, he becomes unclean. Why then does Rabbi Akiva declare him clean in the case where they cling to the hide? Because the hide renders them negligible.","182":"With regard to a thigh-bone of a corpse or a thigh-bone of a consecrated animal, he who touches it, whether it be stopped up or pierced, becomes unclean. With regard to a thighbone of a nevelah or of a dead sheretz, if it was stopped up, he who touches it remains clean, but if it was at all pierced it conveys uncleanness by contact. From where do we know the same rules apply for carrying? Scripture says, \u201cHe that touches and he that carries\u201d (Leviticus 11:39-40), anything that can become unclean by contact can become unclean by carrying. And anything that cannot become unclean by contact, cannot become unclean by carrying.","183":"The egg of a sheretz in which there has formed an embryo is clean. If it was pierced, however small the hole was, it is unclean. A mouse which is half flesh and half earth, if a man touched the flesh he becomes unclean, but if he touched the earth he remains clean. Rabbi Judah says: even if he touched the earth that is over against the flesh he becomes unclean.","184":"Limbs or pieces of flesh which hang loose from a living animal are susceptible to food uncleanness while they are in their place. And in order to become unclean they must be first rendered susceptible to uncleanness. If the animal was slaughtered, they have by the blood of the slaughtering become susceptible to uncleanness, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says: they have not become susceptible to uncleanness. If the animal died, the hanging flesh must be rendered susceptible to uncleanness. The limb is unclean as a limb severed from a living creature, but is not unclean as the limb of a nevelah (carcass), the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon declares it clean.","185":"A limb or a piece of flesh which hangs loose from a person are clean. If the man died, the flesh is clean, the limb is unclean as a limb severed from the living body but is not unclean as a limb severed from a corpse, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon declares it clean.","186":"The law of the shoulder and the cheeks and the stomach is in force both within the Land and outside it, both during the existence of the Temple and after it, in respect of unconsecrated animals but not consecrated animals. For it might have been argued thus: if unconsecrated animals, which are not subject to the law of the breast and the thigh, are subject to these dues, how much more are consecrated animals, with are subject to the law of the breast and the thigh, subject also to these dues! Scripture states, \u201cAnd I have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as a due for ever\u201d only what is mentioned in this passage shall be his.","187":"All consecrated animals whose permanent physical blemish preceded their consecration and were then redeemed: Are subject to the law of the firstling and to the priestly gifts, And when they become like hullin by being redeemed they may be shorn and may be put to work. And their young and their milk are permitted after they have been redeemed. And he who slaughtered them outside the sanctuary is not liable. And they do not render what is substituted for them holy. And if they died they may be redeemed, except for the firstling and the tithe of cattle. All consecrated animals whose consecration preceded their permanent, or their impermanent blemish preceded their consecration and subsequently they contracted a permanent blemish, and they were redeemed: Are exempt from the law of the firstling, and from priestly gifts; And they are not like unconsecrated animals to be shorn or put to work; And even after they have been redeemed their young and their milk are forbidden; And he who slaughtered them outside the sanctuary is liable; And they render what was substituted for them holy, And if they died they must be buried.","188":"A first-born got mixed up with a hundred other animals: If a hundred and one persons slaughtered them all, they are all exempt from the gifts. If one person slaughtered them all, only one animal is exempt from the gifts. If a man slaughtered an animal for a priest or a non-Jew, he is exempt from the gifts. If he had a share in the animal with them, he must indicate this by some sign. If he said, \u201cExcept the gifts\u201d he is exempt from giving the gifts. If he said, \u201cSell me the entrails of a cow\u201d and among them were the gifts, he must give them to a priest and the seller does not need to reduce the price. But if he bought them from him by weight, he must give them to a priest, and the seller must reduce the price.","189":"A convert who converted and owned a cow: If he slaughtered it before he converted, he is exempt from giving the gifts. If he slaughtered it after he converted, he is liable. If there was a doubt about it, he is exempt, for the burden of proof lies upon the claimant. What is \u2018the shoulder\u2019? From the joint up to the shoulder-socket of the forelimb, and this is the same for the nazirite. The corresponding part of the hind leg is called the thigh. Rabbi Judah says: the thigh extends from the joint up to the fleshy part of the leg. What counts as \u2018the cheek? From the joint of the jaw to the last protrusion of the windpipe.","190":"The law of the first of the fleece is in force both within the Land and outside it, both during the existence of the Temple and after it, in respect of unconsecrated animals but not consecrated animals. The law of the shoulder and the cheeks and the stomach is of stricter application than the law of the first of the fleece; for the law of the shoulder and the cheeks and the stomach applies both to herds and flocks, whether they are many or few, whereas the law of the first of the fleece applies only to sheep, and only when there are many.","191":"How much is \u201cmany\u201d? Bet Shammai say: at least two sheep, as it is said, \u201cA man shall rear a young cow and two sheep (tzon)\u201d (Isaiah 7:21). Bet Hillel say: five, as it is said, \u201cFive dressed sheep (tzon)\u201d (I Samuel 28:18). Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas says: five sheep, which each produce a fleece which weighs a maneh and a half, are subject to the law of the first of the fleece. But the sages say: five sheep, whatever their fleeces weigh. And how much should one give him?  The weight of five selas in Judah, which is equal to ten selas in Galilee. Bleached wool and not dirty wool, sufficient to make from it a small garment, for it is written, \u201cGive him,\u201d when there is enough to be considered a gift. If the owner did not manage to give the fleece to the priest until he dyed it, he is exempt. If he bleached it but did not dye it, he is still liable. If a man bought the fleeces of a flock belonging to a non-Jew, he is exempt from the law of the first of the fleece. If a man bought the fleeces of a flock belonging to his neighbor: If the seller kept some back, the seller is liable, But if he did not withhold anything, the buyer is liable. If he had two kinds of wool, grey and white, and he sold the grey but not the white, or if he sold the wool of the males but not of the females, each must give the first of the fleece for himself.","192":"The law of letting the mother bird go from the nest is in force both within the holy land and outside it, both during the existence of the Temple and after it, in respect of unconsecrated birds but not consecrated birds. The law of covering up the blood is of broader application than the law of letting the mother bird go; for the law of covering up the blood applies to wild animals as well as to birds, whether they are at one's disposal or not, whereas the law of letting the mother bird go from the nest applies only to birds and only to those which are not at one's disposal. Which are they that are not at one's disposal? Such as geese and fowls that made their nests in the open field. But if they made their nests within a house or in the case of Herodian doves, one is not bound to let the mother bird go.","193":"An unclean bird one is not obligated to let it go. If an unclean bird was sitting on the eggs of a clean bird, or a clean bird on the eggs of an unclean bird, one is not obligated to let it go. As to a male partridge: Rabbi Eliezer obligates one to let it go. But the sages exempt.","194":"If the mother was hovering over the nest: If her wings touch the nest, one is obligated to let her go; If her wings do not touch the nest, one is not obligated to let her go. If there was but one young bird or one egg in the nest, one is still obligated to let the mother go, for it is written: \u201cA nest,\u201d implying, any nest whatsoever. If there were there young birds able to fly or spoiled eggs, one is not obligated to let the mother go, for it is written, \u201cAnd the mother sitting up on the young or upon the eggs:\u201d Just as the young are living beings so the eggs must be such as would produce living beings; this excludes spoiled eggs. And just as the eggs need the care of the mother so the young must be such as need the care of the mother; this excludes those that are able to fly. If one let the mother go and she returned, even four of five times, he is still obligated to let her go again, for it is written, \u201cYou shall surely let the mother go.\u201d If one said, \u201cI will take the mother and let the young go,\u201d he is still obligated to let her go, for it is written, \u201cYou shall surely let the mother go.\u201d If one took the young and brought them back again to the nest, and afterwards the mother returned to them, he is not obligated to let her go.","195":"If one took the mother with the young: Rabbi Judah says: he has incurred forty lashes and he need not now let her go. But the sages say: he must let her go, and he does not incur lashes. This is the general rule: For the transgression of any negative commandment which has of a remedy by the subsequent fulfillment of a positive commandment one does not incur lashes.","196":"One may not take the mother with the young even for the sake of purifying the metzora. If in respect of so light a commandment, which deals with that which is but worth an issar, the Torah said, \u201cIn order that you may fare well and have a long life\u201d, how much more must be the reward for the observance of the more difficult commandments in the Torah!","197":"There are in the Torah thirty-six transgressions which are punishable with karet:When one has intercourse with his mother, His father's wife; Or his daughter-in-law; When a man has intercourse with a male, Or with a beast, Or when a woman brings a beast upon herself; When one has intercourse with a woman and her daughter; Or with a married woman; Or with his sister; Or with his father's sister; Or his mother's sister; Or his wife's sister; Or his brother's wife; Or the wife of his father's brother; Or with a menstruating woman; One who blasphemes the Lord; One who worships idols; Or dedicates his children to Molech; Or has a ba\u2019al ov; Or desecrates the Shabbat; When an unclean person eats of sacred food; Or when one enters the precincts of the Temple in an unclean state; When one eats forbidden fat, Or blood; Notar; Or piggul; When one slaughters Or offers up a consecrated animal outside the Temple; One who eats anything leavened on Pesah; One who eats Or works on Yom Kippur; One who compounds the oil of anointing; Or compounds incense; Or uses unlawfully oil of anointing; And when one transgresses the laws of the pesah, And circumcision   from among positive commandments.","198":"For these transgressions one is liable to karet if committed intentionally, and if committed unwittingly to a hatat. If there is a doubt whether he had committed the transgression to an asham talui, except in the case of one who defiled the Temple or its consecrated things, for in that case one is liable in this case to a sliding-scale sacrifice, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: also the blasphemer is an exception, as it says: \u201cYou shall have one law for one that acts in error\u201d (Numbers 15:29), this excludes the blasphemer who performs no action.","199":"Some women after childbirth bring an offering which is eaten; some bring one which is not eaten, and some bring no offering at all. These bring an offering which is eaten: If a woman miscarries a fetus which has the shape of beast, or a wild animal or a bird, the words of Rabbi Meir; but the sages say: only if it has a human shape. Or if a woman miscarries a sandal-like fetus or a placenta or a fully formed fetus, or one that comes out in pieces. Similarly, if a female slave miscarries, she brings an offering which is eaten.","200":"The following bring an offering which is not eaten:A woman who miscarries but does not know what the miscarriage was, Or if two women who have a miscarriage, one of a kind which did not render her liable to an offering, and the other of a kind that does render her liable to an offering. Rabbi Yose said: When is this so? This applies only if one went towards the east and the other towards the west, but if both remained together they bring together one offering which is eaten.","201":"The following do not bring a sacrifice:A woman who discharges a sac filled with water or with blood or with pieces of flesh; Or if the miscarriage was in the shape of fish, locust, unclean animals or reptiles; Or if the miscarriage took place on the fortieth day after the conception, Or if it was extracted by means of a caesarean section. Rabbi Shimon declares her liable to an offering in the case of a caesarean section.","202":"If a woman miscarries on the eve of the eighty-first day: Bet Shammai say: she is exempted from an offering. But Bet Hillel say: she is liable. Bet Hillel said to Bet Shammai: what is the difference between the eve of the eighty-first day and the eighty-first day itself? Since these are considered equal with regard to blood uncleanness, why should they not be considered equal also with reference to the offerings? Bet Shammai said to them: No; if you said this in the case where she miscarries on the eighty-first day where it occurred at a time when she was fit to bring an offering, can you say this where she miscarries on the eve of the eighty-first day, where it did not occur at a time when she was fit to bring an offering? Bet Hillel said to them: the case of a woman who miscarries on the eighty-first day which fell on a Shabbat shall prove it, where it did not take place at a time when she was fit to bring an offering and yet she is liable to bring a new offering. Bet Shammai said to them: No; if you says this of the eighty-first day which fell on a Shabbat for although it is not fit for offerings of an individual, it is at least fit for communal offerings, would you maintain this concerning a woman who miscarries on the eve of the eighty-first day, seeing that the night is fit neither for offerings of the individual nor for communal offerings? As to your argument of the uncleanness of the blood, it proves nothing, for if she aborted within the period of cleanness the blood is unclean, and yet she is exempted from an offering.","203":"If a woman had five doubtful genital discharges or five doubtful births, she needs to bring only one offering, and she may eat sacrifices immediately, and she is not liable to bring the other offerings. If a woman had five certain births, or five certain genital discharges, she brings one offering and may then eat sacrifices immediately, and she is liable to bring the other offerings. It once happened in Jerusalem that the price of a pair of doves rose to a golden denar.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said: By this sanctuary, I shall not go to sleep tonight before they cost but a silver denar! Then he entered the court and taught: if a woman had five certain births or five certain genital discharges she needs to bring only one offering, and she may then eat sacrifices, and she is not liable to bring the other offerings. Thereupon the price of a pair of birds stood at a quarter of a silver denar each.","204":"There are four persons who require a ceremony of atonement, and there are four who bring a sacrifice for willful as well as for inadvertent transgression. The following are those who require a ceremony of atonement: the zav, the zavah, the woman who gave birth and the metzora. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob said: also a convert is regarded as a person who still requires a ceremony of atonement until the blood has been sprinkled for him; the same applies to the nazirite with reference to wine, haircutting and uncleanness.","205":"The following bring a sacrifice for willful as well as for inadvertent transgressions:One who has intercourse with a female slave, A nazirite who has become unclean, For a false oath concerning testimony; And for a false oath concerning a deposit.","206":"There are five persons who bring one sacrifice for multiple transgressions, and five who bring a sacrifice of higher or lesser value. The following bring one sacrifice for multiple transgressions:One who has intercourse with a female slave several times, A nazirite who became unclean several times. One who warns his wife in regard to several men, And a metzora who has contracted skin disease several times. If he has offered the birds and then contracted the disease again, they do not count for him until he has offered his hatat. Rabbi Judah says: until he has offered his asham.","207":"A woman who has had several births. If she miscarried a female within eighty days of the birth of a girl, and then she again miscarried a female within eighty days of the previous miscarriage; or if she miscarried twins. Rabbi Judah says: she brings an offering for the first and not for the second, for the third again but not for the fourth. The following persons bring an offering of higher or lesser value: One who hears the voice (see Leviticus 5:1); One who has broken the word of his lips (Leviticus 5:4); One who while unclean has entered the sanctuary or has partaken of holy things, A woman after childbirth And a metzora. What is the difference between intercourse with a female slave and the other forbidden sexual relations?  For they are not equivalent in regard to the punishment nor the sacrifice. In the case of all other forbidden sexual relations a hatat is brought, in that of a female slave an asham; In the case of the other forbidden sexual relations a female animal is brought, in that of the female slave a male; In the case of the other forbidden sexual relations man and woman are alike with respect to lashes and the sacrifice; in that of the female slave the man is unlike the woman regarding the lashes, and the woman is unlike the man regarding the sacrifice. In the case of all other forbidden sexual relations sexual contact is punishable as well as consummation, and one is liable for each act of intercourse separately. For in this the case of the female slave is more stringent in that intentional transgression is of the same status as unwitting transgression.","208":"To which type of female slave does this refer?To one who is half a slave and half a free person, as it is written: \u201cAnd she has been redeemed and not redeemed\u201d (Leviticus 19:20), the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Ishmael says: to a full female slave. Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria says: all other forbidden sexual relations are stated explicitly, and of the remainder there is only one who can be half a slave and half a free person.","209":"In the case of all forbidden relations, if one partner was an adult and the other a minor, the minor is exempt; If one is awake and the other asleep, the one asleep is exempt; If one is an inadvertent and the other intentional, the former is liable to a hatat, the latter to karet.","210":"If they said to him: you ate forbidden fat, he is liable to a hatat; If one witness says: he ate, and another says: he did not eat, or if one woman says, he ate, and another says, he did not eat, he is liable to an asham talui. If one witness says, he ate, and he himself says, I did not eat, he is exempt. If two witnesses say, he ate, and he himself says, I did not eat: Rabbi Meir says he is liable. Rabbi Meir said: if two witnesses are capable of bringing upon him severe penalty of death, can they not impose the less severe punishment of a sacrifice? They replied: suppose he said, I did it intentionally, would he not be exempted?","211":"If one twice ate forbidden fat in one spell of unawareness, he is liable to but one hatat. If one ate forbidden fat, blood, piggul and notar in one spell of unawareness, he is liable for each kind. This is an instance where different kinds of food are more stringent than one kind. In the following instance, however, one kind of food is more stringent than several kinds: if one ate half an olive-size and then again half an olive-size, both in one spell of unawareness, if of one kind he is liable, if of two kinds, he is exempted.","212":"Within what time must he eat them for him to be liable?   The time he would need if he ate a similar amount of parched grains of corn, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the rabbis say: he must take from the beginning to the end of his eating no more time than is required for the eating of a peras to be liable. If one eats unclean food or drinks unclean drinks, or if he drinks a quarter of a log of wine and then enters the Temple he is liable if it takes less time than it takes to eat a peras. Rabbi Elazar says: if the drinking was interrupted or if he diluted it, he is exempt.","213":"It is possible that by one act of eating a person could become liable to four hatats and one asham:If an unclean person eats forbidden fat, which was at the same time notar of an offering, and it was on Yom Kippur. Rabbi Meir says: if it was on Shabbat and he carried it out, he is liable to yet another hatat. But they said to him: this is a different name.","214":"By one act of intercourse one may become liable for six hatats: If one had intercourse with his daughter, he can be guilty of incest with her because she is his daughter, his sister, his brother's wife, the wife of his father's brother, and he can also be guilty of intercourse with a married woman and a menstruant. If one had intercourse with his daughter\u2019s daughter he can be guilty of incest with her because she is his daughter's daughter, his daughter-in-law, his brother's wife, the wife of his father's brother, his wife's sister, a married woman, and a menstruant. Rabbi Yose said: if the grandfather transgressed and married her first, he may thereby become guilty for offending with his father's wife. So too, if one had intercourse with his wife's daughter or her daughter's daughter.","215":"If one had relations with his mother-in-law he may thereby become guilty for having relations with his mother-in-law, his daughter-in-law, his brother's wife, the wife of his father's brother, his wife's sister, a married woman, and a menstruant. And so too, if one had intercourse with the mother of his father-in-law or of his mother-in-law. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said: if one had intercourse with his mother-in-law he may thereby become guilty for having relations with his mother-in-law, the mother of his mother-in-law, and the mother of his father-in-law. They said to him: all these three are the same name.","216":"Rabbi Akiva said: I asked Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Joshua at the meat-market of Emmaus, where they went to buy meat for the wedding feast of Rabban Gamaliel's son: What is the law concerning a man who had intercourse with his sister, his father's sister and his mother's sister? Is he liable for one sacrifice for all of them, or to one separate sacrifice for each of them? They replied: we have heard nothing about this, but we have heard that if one had intercourse with five menstruants in one spell of unawareness, he is liable to a sacrifice for each act, and it seems to us that the case you asked about may be derived by an a fortiori conclusion (kal vehomer).","217":"Rabbi Akiva further asked: If a limb hangs loose from the body of a living beast, what is the law? They replied: We have heard nothing about this, but we have heard about a limb hanging loose from the body of a man, that it is clean. And thus those that were afflicted with boils used to do in Jerusalem. He would go on the eve of Pesah to the doctor, and he would cut the limb until only contact of a hairbreadth was left; he then stuck it on a thorn and then tore himself away from it.  In this manner both that man and the physician could make their pesah offering. And it seems to us that your case may be derived from this by a kal vehomer.","218":"Rabbi Akiba asked again: If a man slaughtered five sacrifices outside the Temple in one spell of unawareness, what is the law? Is he liable to a separate offering for each act or only to one for them all? They replied: we have heard nothing about this. Rabbi Joshua: I have heard that if one eats an offering from five different dishes in one spell of unawareness, he is guilty of sacrilege for each of them; and it seems to me that the case in question may be inferred from this by a kal vehomer. Rabbi Shimon said: Rabbi Akiba did not ask this, but rather concerning one who ate of notar from five sacrifices in one spell of unawareness   what is the law? Is he liable only to one offering for all of them, or is he liable to one for each of them? They replied: we have heard nothing about this. Rabbi Joshua: I have heard that if one eats an offering from five different dishes in one spell of unawareness, he is guilty of sacrilege for each of them; and it seems to me that the case in question may be inferred from this by a kal vehomer. Rabbi Akiba replied: if this is a received tradition we accept it; but if it is only a logical deduction, there is a rebuttal. He Rabbi Joshua said: rebut it. He replied: It is not so. For if you hold the view with regard to sacrilege, for in this case one who gives food to another is as guilty as the one who eats it himself, and the person who causes others to derive a benefit from them is as guilty as the person who himself made use of them; furthermore, small quantities are reckoned together in the case of sacrilege even after the lapse of a long period, can you say it in connection with notar where not one of these laws applies.","219":"Rabbi Akiba said: I asked Rabbi Eliezer: if one performed many acts of forbidden work of the same category on different Shabbats but in one spell of unawareness, what is the law? Is he liable only to one offering for all of them, or to a separate one for each of them? He replied to me: he is liable to a separate one for each of them. And this can be derived by through a kal vehomer. If with regard to relations with a menstruant, for which there are neither many categories nor many ways of sinning, one is still liable for each act, how much more must one be liable to separate offerings in the case of Shabbat, for which there are many categories of work and many ways of sinning! I said to him: No, you may hold this view in the case of the menstruant, since in that case there are two warnings: the man is warned with regard to the menstruant woman, and the menstruant woman is warned with a man; but can you hold the same in the case of the Shabbat where there is only one warning? He said to me: One who has relations with menstruant minors can prove the point, where there is but one warning, and yet one is liable for each act. I responded to him: No, you may hold this view in the case of minors because although no prohibition now applies, it will apply later; but can you hold the same view with regard to Shabbat where neither now nor later is there more than one warning? He said to me: Let the law concerning intercourse with an animal prove my point. I replied to him: the law concerning intercourse with an animal is indeed comparable to that concerning Shabbat.","220":"If a person was in doubt whether he had eaten forbidden fat or not, or even if he had certainly eaten of it but was in doubt as to whether it had the requisite quantity or less; or if there were before him permitted fat as well as forbidden fat, and he ate of one of them and does not know of which of them he ate; Or if his wife and his sister were with him in the house and he unwittingly had sex with one of them and does not know with which of them he unwittingly had sex; Or if he did forbidden labor and does not know whether it was on Shabbat or on a weekday, He is liable for an asham talui.","221":"Just as a person who ate forbidden fat twice in one spell of unawareness is liable to only one hatat, so too, when the transgression is in doubt, he is liable to only one asham talui. If in the meantime he became aware of the possible sin he is liable to a separate asham talui for each act, just as he would in similar circumstances be liable to a separate hatat for each act. Just as one is liable to separate hatats if he ate, in one spell of unawareness, forbidden fat and blood and piggul and notar, so, too, when the transgression is in doubt, he is liable to an asham talui for each different act. If both forbidden fat and notar lay before a person and he ate one of them but does not know which; Or if his menstruant wife and his sister were with him in his house and he has sex unwittingly with one of them and does not know with which, Or if Shabbat and Yom Kippur followed each other and he did forbidden work at twilight and does not know on which day: Rabbi Eliezer declares him liable to a hatat; But Rabbi Joshua exempts him. Rabbi Yose said: they did not dispute about a person that did work at twilight, for he is certainly exempt, for I may assume that part of the work was done on the one day and part on the following day. About what did they dispute? About one who did work during the day itself but he did not know whether he did it on Shabbat or on Yom Kippur, or if he did work and did not know what manner of work he did: Rabbi Eliezer declares him liable to a hatat; But Rabbi Joshua exempts him. Rabbi Judah said: Rabbi Joshua exempts him even from an asham talui.","222":"Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Shimon Shezuri say: They did not dispute regarding transgression of the same name, that in that case he is liable. About what did they dispute? About transgressions of different names: Rabbi Eliezer declares him liable to a hatat, And Rabbi Joshua declares him exempt. Rabbi Judah said: even if he intended to pick figs and he picked grapes, or grapes and he picked figs, white grapes and he picked black ones, or black and he picked white ones Rabbi Eliezer declares him liable to a hatat. And Rabbi Joshua declares him exempt. Rabbi Judah said: I wonder whether Rabbi Joshua indeed declared him exempt in such a case. For then why is it written, \u201cwith which he has sinned\u201d (Leviticus 4:23)? To exclude mindless action.","223":"If one ate blood of a slaughtered beast, a wild animal or a bird, either clean or unclean, or blood of an animal stabbed in his throat or neck, or of the blood of an animal slaughtered by having his throat ripped, or of the blood of the arteries whereby life-force escapes, he is liable. But if he ate the blood of the spleen or of the heart, or blood found in eggs, or blood of fish, or of locusts, or secondary blood, he is not liable. Rabbi Judah says: he is liable for secondary blood.","224":"Rabbi Akiva declares one liable to an asham talui for sacrilege; But the sages declare him exempt. Rabbi Akiba admits that he does not bring his restitution money until he becomes aware of his trespass, when he must bring with it a certain asham. Rabbi Tarfon: Why should he bring two ashams?  Rather, let him set aside the principal with an added fifth, and bring an asham the value of two sela's and stipulate: \u201cIf I did commit sacrilege, here is my restitution and this my asham; and if the sacrilege was doubtful, let the money be a freewill gift and the offering an asham talui;\u201d since the same type of sacrifice he brings for a case where he doesn\u2019t know, he brings for one where he does know.","225":"Rabbi Akiba: Your words seem plausible in the case of a minor amount of sacrilege; but if it was a case of doubtful sacrilege of a hundred manehs, would it not be more advantageous for him to bring an asham for two sela's rather than restore out of doubt the sum of a hundred manehs? Rabbi Akiba agrees with Rabbi Tarfon in the case of a minor amount of sacrilege. If a woman brought a bird hatat for a case of a doubtful miscarriage, and prior to the pinching of its neck she learned that the birth was a certainty, she can offer it as a certain hatat, for that which she offers in the case of certainty is of the same kind as that which she offers in the case of doubt.","226":"If there was a piece of hullin meat and a piece of sacred meat, and a person ate one of them and does not know which of them he ate, he is exempt. Rabbi Akiba declares him liable for an asham talui. If he then ate the second piece, he is liable to a certain asham. If he ate one piece and another came and ate the other, each of them is liable to an asham talui, the words of Rabbi Akiba. Rabbi Shimon says: they together bring one asham. Rabbi Yose said: Two people cannot bring one asham.","227":"If there was a piece of forbidden fat and a piece of hullin permitted fat, and a person ate one of them and does not know which, he is liable to an asham talui. If he then ate the second piece, he is brings a hatat. If he ate the one piece and another came and ate the other, each of them is liable to an asham talui. Rabbi Shimon says: they together bring one hatat. Rabbi Yose says: two people cannot bring one hatat.","228":"If there was a piece of forbidden fat and a piece of consecrated permitted fat, and a person ate one of them and does not know which, he is liable to an asham talui; If he then ate the second piece, he is liable to a hatat and a certain asham. If he ate the one piece and another came and ate the other, each of them brings an asham talui. Rabbi Shimon holds: they together bring a hatat and an asham. Rabbi Yose: two people cannot together bring one hatat and one asham.","229":"If there was a piece of unconsecrated forbidden fat and a piece of consecrated forbidden fat, and a person ate one of them and does not know which, he is liable to a hatat. Rabbi Akiva says: also to an asham talui. If he then ate the second piece, he is liable to two hatats and one certain asham. If he ate one piece and another came and ate the other, each of them is liable to a hatat. Rabbi Akiva says: each of them brings in addition an asham talui. Rabbi Shimon holds: each of them brings a hatat and together they bring one asham. Rabbi Yose: two people cannot bring one asham.","230":"If there was a piece of forbidden fat and another piece of forbidden fat which was at the same time notar, and a person ate one of them and does not know which, he is liable to a hatat and to an asham talui. If he then ate the second piece, he is liable to three hatats. If he ate one piece and another came and ate the other, each of them brings a hatat and an asham talui. Rabbi Shimon says: each of them brings a hatat and together they bring another hatat. Rabbi Yose says: any hatat that is brought for the expiation of sin cannot be offered by two people.","231":"If a person brought an asham talui and then found out that he did not sin: If it was before the animal was slaughtered, it may go out to pasture among the flock, the words of Rabbi Meir. The sages say: it goes out to pasture until it becomes blemished and it is then sold, and the money goes for freewill-offerings. Rabbi Eliezer says: it shall be offered up, for if it does not expiate this sin, it will expiate another sin. If he learns of it after it was slaughtered, the blood shall be spilled out and the flesh is removed to the place of burning. If the blood had already been tossed onto the altar, the flesh may be eaten. Rabbi Yose says: even if the blood is still in the vessel, it should be tossed and the flesh then eaten.","232":"The law is different with a certain asham: If before the animal was slaughtered, it may go out to pasture among the flock; If after it was slaughtered, it shall be buried; If after the blood was tossed, the flesh must be removed to the place of burning. The law is also different regarding an ox to be stoned: If before it was stoned, it may go out to pasture among the flock; If after it was stoned, it is permitted for use. The law is also different regarding the heifer whose neck is to be broken: If before its neck was broken, it may go out to pasture among the flock. If after its neck was broken, it shall be buried on the spot, for it was from the outset brought in a matter of doubt, it has atoned for the doubt, and so has served its purpose.","233":"Rabbi Eliezer says: one may freely offer an asham talui every day and at any time he pleases and such a sacrifice is called the asham of the pious. They said of Bava ben Buti that he used to freely offer an asham talui every day, except on the day after Yom Kippur. He declared: By this temple! Had they allowed me, I would have offered one even then, but they said to me, wait until you have come to a state of doubt.\u201d But the sages say one may not bring an asham talui except for a sin that is punished by karet when done intentionally and for which one brings a hatat when done unwittingly.","234":"Those that are liable to hatats or to certain ashams and Yom Kippur passes over them, are still liable to bring them after Yom Kippur. Those that are liable to asham talui\u2019s are exempt. He who has committed a doubtful sin on Yom Kippur, even at twilight, is exempt, because the whole of the day effects atonement.","235":"If a woman is liable to a bird hatat brought in a case of doubt and Yom Kippur intervenes, she is still bound to offer it after Yom Kippur, because it renders her fit to eat sacrifices. If a hatat of a bird was brought for a matter of doubt and, after the pinching of its neck it became known that there was no need for it, it must be buried.","236":"A man set apart two sela's for an asham:If he bought with it two rams for an asham; if one was of the value of two sela's, it may be offered for his asham, and the other must be let out to pasture until it becomes blemished when it is sold and its value goes for freewill-offerings. If he had bought with the money two rams for hullin use, one worth two sela's and the other worth ten zuz, that which is worth two sela's should be offered for his asham and the other for his sacrilege. If he had bought with the money one for an asham and the other for ordinary use, if that for the asham was worth two sela's it should be offered for his asham and the other for his sacrilege, and with it he shall bring a sela and its fifth.","237":"If a man set aside his hatat and then died, his son should not offer it after him. A man may not offer what was set apart for one sin for another sin. Even if he had set apart the hatat for forbidden fat that he had eaten yesterday, he may not offer it for forbidden fat that he has eaten today, for it is said, \u201cHis offering ... for his sin\u201d the offering must be for that particular sin.","238":"One may bring with money dedicated to buy a lamb for a hatat a goat, or with what was dedicated to buy a goat one may bring a lamb; Or with what was dedicated to buy a lamb or a goat one may bring turtle-doves or young pigeons; Or with what was dedicated to buy turtle-doves or young pigeons one may bring the tenth of an ephah. How so? If a man set apart money for a lamb or a goat for a hatat and he became poor, he may bring a bird-offering; If he became still poorer he may bring the tenth of an ephah. If a man set apart money for the tenth of an ephah and he became richer, he must bring a bird-offering; If he became still richer he must bring a lamb or a goat. If a man set apart a lamb or a goat and they became blemished, he may bring with their price a bird-offering; But if he set apart a bird-offering and it became blemished, he may not bring with its price the tenth of an ephah, since a bird-offering cannot be redeemed.","239":"Rabbi Shimon says: lambs are mentioned before goats in all places. You might think that it is because they are choicer, therefore Scripture states, \u201cAnd if he brings a lamb as his offering,\u201d to teach that both are equal. Turtle-doves are mentioned before young pigeons in all places. You might think that it is because they are choicer, therefore Scripture states, \u201cA young pigeon or a turtle-dove for a hatat,\u201d to teach that both are equal. The father comes before the mother in all places. You might think that it is because the honor due a father is greater than the honor due a mother, therefore Scripture states, \u201cA man shall fear his mother and his father,\u201d (Leviticus 19: to teach that both are equal. But the sages have said: the father comes before the mother in all places, because both a son and his mother are obligated to honor the father. And so it is also with the study of Torah; if the son has been worthy to sit before the teacher, the teacher comes before the father in all places, because both a man and his father are obligated to honor the teacher.","240":"A bird hatat is performed below the red line, but a beast hatat is performed above the red line. A bird olah is performed above, but a beast olah below. If he changed this procedure with either, then the offering is disqualified. The seder ordered ritual in the case of kinnim  is as follows: In the case of obligatory offerings, one bird is a hatat and one an olah. In the case of vows and freewill offerings, however, all are olot. What constitutes a vow? When one says: \"It is incumbent upon me to bring an olah.\" And what constitutes a freewill-offering? When one says: \"Behold, this shall be an olah.\" What is the practical difference between vows and freewill offerings? In the case of vows, if they die or are stolen, one is responsible for their replacement; But in the case of freewill offerings, if they die or are stolen, one is not responsible for their replacement.","241":"If a hatat becomes mixed up with an olah, or an olah with a hatat, were it even one in ten thousand, they all must be left to die. If a hatat  becomes mixed up with unassigned obligatory bird offerings, the only ones that are valid are those that correspond to the number of hatats among the obligatory offerings. Similarly, if an olah becomes mixed up with unassigned obligatory bird offerings, the only ones that are valid are those that correspond to the number of olot among the obligatory offerings This rule holds true whether the unassigned obligatory offerings are in the majority and the freewill-offerings in the minority, or the freewill-offerings are in the majority and those that are obligatory in the minority, or whether they are both equal in number.","242":"When is this so?  When obligatory offerings get mixed up with voluntary offerings. When, however, obligatory offerings get mixed up one with another, with one pair belonging to one woman and the other pair to another woman, or two pairs belonging to one and two pairs to another, or three pairs to one and three pairs to another, then half of these are valid and the other half disqualified. If one pair belongs to one woman and two pairs to another, or three pairs to another, or ten pairs to another or one hundred to another, only the lesser number remains valid. Whether they are of the same denomination   or of two denominations,   or whether they belong to one woman or to two.","243":"What is meant by one \"name\"? For a birth and a birth, or for zivah and zivah, that is one name. And \"two names\"? For a birth, and the other for a zivah. What is meant by \"two women\"? When one woman brings her offering for a birth and the other for a birth, or when one brings for a zivah and the other for a zivah this is \"of one name\". And a case \"of two names\"? When one brings for a birth and the other for a zivah. Rabbi Yose says: when two women purchased their kinnim in partnership, or gave the price of their kinnim to the priest for him to purchase them, then the priest can offer whichever one he wants as a hatat or as an olah, whether they are of one name or of two names.","244":"If from an unassigned pair of birds a single pigeon flew into the open air, or flew among birds that had been left to die, or if one of the pair died, then he must take a mate for the second one. If it flew among birds that are to be offered up,  it becomes invalid  and it invalidates another bird as its counterpart in the pair;  for the pigeon that flew away is invalid and invalidates another bird as its counterpart in the pair.","245":"How is this so?Two women, this one has two pairs and this one has two pairs, and one bird flies from the pair of one to the other woman's pair, then it disqualifies by its escape one of the birds from which it flew. If it returned, it disqualifies yet another by its return. If it flew away again and then returned, and again flew away and returned, no further loss is incurred,  since even if they had all become mixed together, not less than two pairs would still be valid.","246":"If one woman had one pair, another two, another three, another four, another five, another six and another seven pairs,  and one bird flew from the first to the second pair, and then a bird flew from there to the third, and then a bird flew from there to the fourth, and from there a bird flew to the fifth and from there a bird flew to the sixth, and from there a bird flew to the seventh, and then a bird returns in the same order as they flew away it disqualifies at each flight and at each return. The first and second women have none left, the third has one pair, the fourth two, the fifth three, the sixth four, and the seventh six pairs. If again one from each group flew away and returned in the same order as above, it disqualifies at each flight and return. The third and fourth woman have none left, the fifth has one pair, the sixth two pairs, and the seventh woman five pairs. If again one from each group flew away and returned in the same order as above, it disqualifies at each flight and return. The fifth and sixth women have none left, and the seventh has four pairs. But some say that the seventh woman has lost nothing. If a bird from those that are left to die escaped to any of all the groups, then all must be left to die.","247":"An unassigned pair and an assigned pair:  if one bird from the unassigned pair flew to the assigned pair, then a pair must be taken for the second bird. If one bird flew back,  or if in the first place a bird from the assigned pair flew to the other pair, then all must be left to die.","248":"Hatat birds are on one side, and olot birds are on the other and an unassigned pair is in the middle: If from the middle pair one bird flew to this side, and one bird flew to this side, then he has not lost anything, because he the priest says that the bird that flew from the middle towards the hataot is a hatat and the bird that flew towards the olot is a burnt-offering. If one from each side returns to the middle, then all those in the middle must be left to die, but those left on either side can be offered up as hataot or as olot respectively. If again a bird from the middle returned and flew away to the sides,  then all must be left to die. One cannot pair turtle-doves with pigeons or pigeons with turtle-doves.  How is this so? If a woman has brought a turtle-dove as her hatat and a pigeon as her olah, she must then bring another turtle-dove as her burnt-offering; If her olah had been a turtle-dove and her hatat a pigeon, then she must bring another pigeon as her olah. Ben Azzai says: we go after the first offering. If a woman brought her hatat and then died, her heirs must bring her olah; But if she first brought her olah and then died, her heirs need not bring her hatat.","249":"When are these words said?  When the priest asks advice. But in the case of a priest who does not seek advice, and one pair belongs to one woman and one to another, or two pairs to one and two to another, or three pairs to one and three to another,  and he offered  all of them above the red line, then half are valid and half are invalid. Similarly, if he offered all of them below, half are valid and half are invalid. If he offered half of them above and half of them below, then of those offered above, half are valid and half are invalid, and also of those offered below, half are valid and half are invalid.","250":"If one pair belonged to one woman and two pairs to another, or even three pairs to another, or ten pairs to another or a hundred to another,  and he offered all of them above, then half are valid and half are invalid. Similarly, if he offered all of them below, half are valid and half are invalid. If he offered half of them above and half below, then the number of birds as there is in the larger part are valid. This is the general principle: whenever you can divide the pairs of birds so that those belonging to one woman need not have part of them offered above and part offered below, then half of them are valid and half are invalid; But whenever you cannot divide the pairs of birds without some of those belonging to one woman being offered above and some below, then the number as there is in the larger part are valid.","251":"If the hatats belonged to one and the olot to another, and the priest offered them all above, then half are valid and half disqualified. If he offered them all below, half are valid and half disqualified. If he offered half of them above and half below, then all of them are disqualified, because I can argue that the hatats were offered above and the olot below.","252":"If a hatat, an olah, an unassigned pair of birds and an assigned  pair became mixed up, and he offered them all above, then half are valid and half are invalid. Similarly if he offered all of them below, half are valid and half are invalid. If he offered half of them above and half below, none is valid except the unassigned pair, and that must be divided between them.","253":"If hataot birds were mixed up with unassigned birds that were obligatory offerings, only the number of hataot among the obligatory offerings are valid. If the unassigned obligatory offerings are twice as many as the hataot, then half are valid and half invalid; But if the hataot are twice as many as the unassigned obligatory offerings, then the number of hataot among the obligatory offerings are valid. So, too, if birds assigned as olot were mixed up with unassigned obligatory offerings, only the number of olot among the obligatory offerings are valid. If the unassigned obligatory offerings are twice as many as the olot, then half are valid and half invalid. But if the olot are twice as many as the unassigned obligatory offerings, then the number of olot among the obligatory offerings are valid.","254":"If a woman says: \"I vow a pair of birds if I give birth to a male child,\" and she does give birth to a male child, then she must offer up two pairs   one for her vow and one for her obligation. If before she assigned them she gave them to the priest, and the priest who ought to offer three birds above and one below does not do so, but offers two above and two below, and does not seek guidance, she must she bring another bird and offer that above. This is so if the birds were of the same kind. If they were of two kinds, then must she bring two others. If she had expressly defined her vow, then must she bring three other birds. This is so if the birds were of the same kind. If they were of two kinds, then must she bring four others. If she made a definite fixture at the time of her vow, then must she bring another five birds. This is so if the birds were of the same kind. If they were of two kinds, then must she bring six others. If she gave them to the priest and it is not known what she gave, and the priest performed the sacrifice, but it is not known how he performed it, then she must bring four other birds for her vow,  and two for her obligation  and one for her hatat. Ben Azzai says: she must bring two hatats. Rabbi Joshua said: This is what it meant when they said: \"When the beast is alive it possesses one sound, but when it is dead its sound is sevenfold.\"  In what way is its sound sevenfold? Its two horns are made into two trumpets, its two leg-bones into two flutes, its hide into a drum, its entrails for lyres and its large intestines for harp strings; and there are some who add that its wool is used for the blue pomegranates. Rabbi Shimon ben Akashiah says: ignorant old people, the older they become, the more their intellect gets befuddled, as it is said: \"He removes the speech of men of trust and takes away the sense of the elders.\"   But when it comes to aged scholars, it is not so. On the contrary, the older they get, the more their mind becomes composed, as it is said: \"With aged men comes wisdom, and understanding in length of days.\"","255":"Most holy sacrifices which were slaughtered on the south side of the altar, the law of sacrilege still applies to them. If they were slaughtered on the south side and their blood received on the north or slaughtered on the north side and their blood received on the south, or if they were slaughtered by day and their blood sprinkled during the night or slaughtered during the night and their blood sprinkled by day, or if they were slaughtered with the intention of eating the flesh beyond its proper time or outside its proper place, the law of sacrilege still applies to them. Rabbi Joshua stated a general rule: whatever has at some time been permitted to the priests is not subject to the law of sacrilege, and whatever has at no time been permitted to the priests is subject to the law of sacrilege. Which is that which has at some time been permitted to the priests? Sacrifices which remained overnight or became defiled or were taken out of the Temple Court. Which is that which has at no time been permitted to the priests? Sacrifices that were slaughtered with the intention of eating its flesh beyond its proper time or outside its proper place, or the blood of which was received by the unfit and they sprinkled it.","256":"If the flesh of most holy sacrifices was taken out of the Temple court before the blood was sprinkled: Rabbi Eliezer says: it is still subject to the laws of sacrilege and one does not become guilty of transgressing with it the laws of notar, piggul and defilement. Rabbi Akiba says: it is not subject to the laws of sacrilege and one can become guilty of transgressing with it the laws of notar, piggul and defilement. Rabbi Akiba said: if one set aside his hatat and it was lost and he set aside another in its place and afterwards the first was found, and both of them are in front of us, do you not agree that just as the sprinkling of the blood of the one exempts its own flesh from the laws of sacrilege so it exempts the flesh of the other one? Now, if the sprinkling of its blood can exempt the flesh of the other from the laws of sacrilege, how much more must it exempt its own flesh.","257":"If the innards of sacrifices of that have a lower degree of holiness were taken out of the Temple court before the blood was sprinkled:Rabbi Eliezer says: they are not subject to the laws of sacrilege and one cannot become guilty of transgressing with them the laws of notar, piggul and defilement. Rabbi Akiva says: they are subject to the laws of sacrilege and one can become guilty of transgressing with them the laws of notar, piggul and defilement.","258":"The act of sprinkling the blood of most holy sacrifices may have either a lenient or a stringent effect, but with sacrifices of a lesser degree of holiness it has only a stringent effect. How so? With most holy sacrifices, before the sprinkling, the law of sacrilege applies both to the innards and to the flesh; after the sprinkling it applies to the innards but not to the flesh; In respect of both one is guilty of transgressing the laws of notar, iggul and defilement. It is thus found that with most holy sacrifices the act of sprinkling has a lenient as well as a stringent effect. With sacrifices of a lesser degree of holiness it has only a stringent effect. How so? With sacrifices of a lesser degree of holiness, before the sprinkling the law of sacrilege does not apply to the innards or to the flesh; after the sprinkling it applies to the innards but not to the flesh; In respect of both one is guilty of transgressing the laws of notar, piggul and defilement. It is thus found that with sacrifices of a lesser degree of holiness it has only a stringent effect.","259":"The law of sacrilege applies to the hatat of a bird from the moment of its dedication. With the pinching of its neck it becomes susceptible to be disqualified through contact with a tevul yom or one who still requires atonement, or by remaining overnight. Once its blood has been sprinkled it is subject to the laws of piggul, notar and defilement, but the law of sacrilege no longer applies to it.","260":"The law of sacrilege applies to the olah of a bird from the moment of its dedication. With the pinching of its neck it becomes susceptible to be disqualified through contact with a tevul yom or one who still requires atonement, or by remaining overnight. Once its blood has been squeezed out onto the walls of the altar it is subject to the laws of piggul, notar and defilement; And the law of sacrilege applies to it until the ashes have been removed from the altar to the place of the ashes.","261":"The law of sacrilege applies to the bullocks which are to be burned and the goats which are to be burned from the moment of their dedication. Once slaughtered they become susceptible to be disqualified through contact with a tevul yom or one who still requires atonement, or by remaining overnight. Once their blood has been sprinkled they are subject to the laws of piggul, notar and defilement. And the law of sacrilege applies to them even while they are at the place of the ashes so long as the flesh has not been charred.","262":"The law of sacrilege applies to an olah from the moment of its dedication. When it is slaughtered it becomes susceptible to be disqualified through contact with a tevul yom or one who still requires atonement, or by remaining overnight. Once its blood has been sprinkled it is subject to the laws of piggul, notar and defilement; And the law of sacrilege does not apply to its hide, but it does apply to it flesh until the ashes have been removed from the altar to the place of the ashes.","263":"The law of sacrilege applies to the hatat, and asham and to shelamim sacrifices of the congregation from the moment of their dedication. Once slaughtered they become susceptible to be disqualified through contact with a tevul yom or one who still requires atonement, or by remaining overnight. Once their blood has been sprinkled they are subject to the laws of piggul, notar and defilement. The law of sacrilege then no longer applies to the flesh, but applies to the innards until the ashes are removed to the place of the ashes.","264":"The law of sacrilege applies to the two loaves of bread from the moment of their dedication. Once they have formed a crust in the oven they become susceptible to be disqualified through contact with a tevul yom or one who still requires atonement, and the festival offerings can then be slaughtered. Once the blood of the lambs has been sprinkled they the loaves are subject to the laws of piggul, notar and defilement, and the law of sacrilege no longer applies to them.","265":"The law of sacrilege applies to the showbread from the moment of its dedication. Once it has formed a crust in the oven it becomes susceptible to be disqualified through contact with a tevul yom or one who still requires atonement, and it may be arranged upon the table of the Sanctuary. Once the dishes of incense have been offered it is subject to the laws of piggul, notar and defilement, and the law of sacrilege no longer applies to it.","266":"Our mishnah discusses how the law of sacrilege relates to menahot.The law of sacrilege applies to menahot from the moment of their dedication. Once they have become sacred by being put in the vessel of service they become susceptible for unfitness through contact with a tevul yom or one who still requires atonement, or by remaining overnight. Once the handful has been offered they are subject to the law of piggul, notar and defilement, and the law of sacrilege no longer applies to the remnants, but it applies to the handful until its ashes have been removed to the place of the ashes.","267":"The law of sacrilege applies to the handful of a minhah, the frankincense, the incense, the minhah of a priest, the minhah of the anointed high priest and the minhah that is accompanied by a libation, from the moment of their dedication. Once they have become sacred by being put in the vessel, they become susceptible for unfitness through contact with a tevul yom or one who still requires atonement, or by remaining overnight, and they are subject to the laws of notar and defilement, but the law of piggul does not apply to them. This is the general rule: whatever has something else which renders it permissible for the altar or for the use of the priests is not subject to the laws of piggul, nothar and defilement until that act has been performed. And whatever does not have something else which renders it permissible becomes subject to the laws of notar and defilement as soon as it has become sacred by being put in the vessel, but piggul does not apply to it.","268":"The offspring of a hatat, the substitute of a hatat, and a hatat whose owner has died, are left to die. A hatat whose year has passed or which was lost and found blemished: If the owners obtained atonement afterwards, through another animal, is left to die, and it does not make a substitute; it is forbidden to derive benefit from it, but the law of sacrilege does not apply. If the owners have not yet obtained atonement, it must go to pasture until it becomes unfit for sacrifice. It is then sold and another is bought with the money. It makes a substitute, and the law of sacrilege does apply.","269":"If one has set aside money for his nazirite offerings, it may not be used, but the law of sacrilege does not apply to it, as it may all be used for the shelamim. If he died and left money for his nazirite offerings If unspecified it shall go to the fund for voluntary offerings; If specified: The money designated for the hatats shall be taken to the Dead Sea; it may not be used, though the law of sacrilege does not apply to it. With the money designated for an olah they shall bring a olah; the law of sacrilege applies to it. With the money designated for the shelamim they shall bring a shelamim, and it has to be consumed within a day, but requires no bread offering.","270":"Rabbi Ishmael says: the law relating to blood is lenient at the beginning before it is offered and stringent at the end; the law relating to libations is stringent at the beginning and lenient at the end. Blood at the beginning is not subject to the law of sacrilege, but is subject to it after it has flowed away to the Wadi Kidron. Libations at the beginning are subject to the law of sacrilege, but are exempted from it after they flowed down into the shitin.","271":"The ashes of the inner altar and of the wicks of the menorah may not be used but they are not subject to the law of sacrilege. If one dedicates ashes they are subject to the law of sacrilege. Turtle-doves which have not reached the right age and pigeons which have exceeded the right age may not be used but they are not subject to the law of sacrilege. Rabbi Shimon said: turtle-doves which have not yet reached the right age are subject to the law of sacrilege, while pigeons which have exceeded the right age are not allowed for use, but are exempt from the law of sacrilege.","272":"The milk of consecrated animals and the eggs of consecrated turtle-doves may not be used, but are not subject to the law of sacrilege. When is this so? For things dedicated for the altar, but as for things dedicated for Temple upkeep, if one consecrated a chicken both it and its eggs are subject to the law of sacrilege, or if one dedicated a she-donkey, both it and its milk are subject to the law of sacrilege.","273":"Whatever is fit for the altar and not for Temple repair, for Temple repair and not for the altar, neither for the altar nor for Temple repair is subject to the law of sacrilege. How so? If one consecrated a cistern full of water, a dump full of manure, a dove-cote full of pigeons, a tree laden with fruit, a field covered with herbs, the law of sacrilege applies to them and to their contents. But if one consecrated a cistern and it was later filled with water, a dump and it was later filled with manure, a dove-cote and it was later filled with pigeons, a tree and it afterwards bore fruit or a field and it afterwards produced herbs, the law of sacrilege applies to the consecrated objects themselves but not to their contents, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Shimon says: if one consecrated a field or a tree, the law of sacrilege applies to it and to its produce for it is the growth of consecrated property. The young of cattle set aside as tithe may not nurse from cattle set aside for tithe, but others consecrate for such use. The young of consecrated cattle may not nurse from consecrated cattle, but others consecrate for such use. Workers may not eat dry figs dedicated to the Temple, nor may a cow eat of the vetch belonging to the Temple.","274":"If the roots of a privately owned tree spread onto dedicated ground, or those of a tree in dedicated ground spread onto private ground, they may not be used, but the law of sacrilege does not apply to them. The water of a spring which comes out of a dedicated field may not be used, but the law of sacrilege does not apply to it When it has left the field it may be used. The water in the golden jar may not be used, but the law of sacrilege does not apply to it. When it has been poured into the flask, it is subject to the law of sacrilege. The willow branch may not be used, but is not subject to the law of sacrilege. Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Zadok says: the elders used to put it with their palm tree branches.","275":"A nest which is built on the top of a dedicated tree, one may not derive benefit from it, but the law of sacrilege does not apply to it. That which is on the top of an asherah, one flicks it off with a reed. If one dedicated a forest to the temple, the law of sacrilege applies to the whole of it. If the treasurers of the Temple bought trees, the lumber is subject to the law of sacrilege but not the chips and not the fallen leaves.","276":"Things dedicated for the altar combine with one another with regard to the law of sacrilege, and to render one liable over them for the laws of piggul, notar and defilement.

Things that are alike in respect of duration of uncleanness but not in respect of minimum measure, in respect of minimum measure but not in respect of duration of uncleanness, or if they are alike neither in respect of duration of uncleanness nor in respect of measure, cannot combine with one another.","279":"Piggul and remnant do not combine with one another because they are of two different names. Sheretz and carrion, as well as carrion and the flesh of a corpse do not combine with one another to effect impurity, not even in respect of the more lenient of the two grades of defilement. Food contaminated through contact with a primary defilement can combine with that contaminated by a secondary defilement to affect uncleanness according to the lower degree of defilement of the two.","280":"All kinds of food can combine with one another:To make up the quantity of half a peras in order to render the body unfit To make up the food for two meals to form an eruv; To make up the volume of an egg to contaminate food; To make up the volume of a dry fig with regard to carrying on Shabbat; And the volume of a date with regard to Yom Kippur.

Because these are all susceptible to the uncleanness caused by sitting.","282":"If one derived a perutah's worth of benefit from a sacred thing, he is guilty of sacrilege even though he did not lessen its value, the words of Rabbi Akiva. But the sages say: Anything that can deteriorate through use, the law of sacrilege applies to it only after it has suffered deterioration. And anything that does not deteriorate through use, the law of sacrilege applies to it as soon as he made use of it. How is this so? If a woman puts a necklace round her neck or a ring on her finger, or if she drank from a golden cup, she is liable to the law of sacrilege as soon as she made use of it to the value of a perutah. But if one puts on a shirt or covers oneself with a cloak, or if one chopped wood with an axe, he is subject to the law of sacrilege only if those objects have suffered deterioration. If one sheared a hatat while it was alive, he is not liable for sacrilege sacrilege unless he has diminished its value. If when dead, he is liable as soon as he made use of it.","283":"If one derived half a perutah's worth of benefit and impaired the value of the used article by another half a perutah, or if one derived a perutah's worth of benefit from one thing and diminished another thing by the value of a perutah, he had not committed sacrilege, until he benefits a perutah's worth and diminishes the value of a perutah of the same thing.","284":"One does not commit sacrilege after sacrilege has already been committed by another person, except with domesticated animals and vessels of ministry. How so? If one rode on a beast and then another came and rode on it and yet another came and rode on it; Or if one drank from a golden cup, then another came and drank and yet another came and drank; Or if one plucked of the wool of a hatat, then another came and plucked and yet another came and plucked, all of them are guilty of sacrilege. Rabbi said: anything that cannot be redeemed is subject to the law of sacrilege even after sacrilege has been already committed with it.","285":"If he removed a stone or a beam belonging to Temple property, he is not guilty of sacrilege. But if he gave it to his friend he is guilty of sacrilege, but his fellow is not guilty. If he built it into his house he is not guilty of sacrilege until he lives beneath it and benefits the equivalent of a perutah. If he took a perutah from Temple property he is not guilty of sacrilege. But if he gave it to his friend he is guilty of sacrilege, but his fellow is not guilty. If he gave it to the bathhouse keeper, he is guilty of sacrilege even though he has not bathed, for he can say to him, \u201cBehold the bath is ready for you, go in and bathe.\u201d","286":"The portion which a person has eaten himself and that which he has given his friend to eat, or the portion which he has made use of himself and that which he has given to his friend to make use of, or the portion which he has eaten himself and that which he has given his friend to make use of, or the portion which he has made use of himself and that which he has given his friend to eat can combine with one another even after the lapse of a lot of time.","287":"If an agent has fulfilled his agency, the sender is guilty of sacrilege, but if he has not carried out his agency, he himself is guilty of sacrilege.

If it was loose he may use it and therefore if he spent it he is not guilty of sacrilege.

If a priest removed the handful with his left hand it is invalid. Ben Batera says: he may put the handful back and take it out again with the right hand. If on taking the handful there came into his hand a small stone or a grain of salt or a drop of frankincense it is invalid, for they have said: if the handful was too much or too little it is invalid.

If he intended to burn its frankincense the next day: Rabbi Yose says: it is invalid but he is not liable for karet. But the sages say: it is piggul and he is liable for karet.

But the sages say, both are piggul and he is liable for karet for both of them. If one of the two loaves or one of the two rows of the showbread became unclean: Rabbi Judah says: both must be taken out to the place of burning, for the offering of the congregation may not be divided. But the sages say, the unclean is treated as unclean, but the clean may be eaten.","299":"The todah can render the bread piggul but the bread does not render the todah piggul. How so? If he slaughtered the todah intending to eat part of it on the next day, both it and the bread are piggul; if he intended to eat part of the bread the next day, the bread is piggul but the todah is not piggul. The lambs can render the bread piggul but the bread cannot render the lambs piggul. How so? If he slaughtered the lambs intending to eat part of them the next day, both they and the bread are piggul; if he intended to eat part of the bread the next day, the bread is piggul but the lambs are not.","300":"The animal-offering can render the libations piggul after they have been sanctified in the vessel, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the libations cannot render the animal-offering piggul. Thus, if he slaughtered an animal-offering intending to eat part of it on the next day, both it and the libations are piggul; if he intended to offer the libations the next day, the libations are piggul but the animal-offering is not.","301":"If he had an intention which makes piggul with regard to the remainder of the minhah during the burning of the handful and not during the burning of the frankincense, or during the burning of the frankincense and not during the burning of the incense: Rabbi Meir says: it is piggul and he is liable for karet for it; But the sages say: there is no karet unless he had an intention that makes piggul during the service of the whole of the mattir. The sages agree with Rabbi Meir with regard to a sinner\u2019s minhah or a minhah of jealousy, that if he had an intention which makes piggul during the burning of the handful, the remainder is piggul and he is liable for karet for it, since the handful is the entire mattir. If he slaughtered one of the lambs intending to eat the two loaves the next day, or if he burned one of the dishes of frankincense intending to eat the two rows of the showbread on the next day: Rabbi Meir says: it is piggul and he is liable for karet for it; But the sages say: it is not piggul, unless he had an intention that makes piggul during the service of the whole of the mattir. If he slaughtered one of the lambs intending to eat part of it the next day, that lamb is piggul but the other lamb is valid. If he intended to eat the other lamb the next day, both are valid.","302":"If he took the handful from the minhah intending to eat outside its proper place or after its proper time a thing that it is not usual to eat or to burn outside its proper place or after its proper time a thing that it is not usual to burn, the offering is valid. But Rabbi Eliezer says it is invalid. If he intended to eat less than an olive's worth of a thing that it is usual to eat, or to burn   less than an olive's worth of a thing that it is usual to burn, the offering is valid. If he intended to eat a half of an olive's worth and to burn a half of an olive\u2019s worth, the offering is valid, for eating and burning cannot be reckoned together.","303":"If he did not pour in the oil, or if he did not mix it, or if he did not break up the minhah into pieces, or if he did not salt it, or wave it, or if he did not draw it near, or if he broke it up into large pieces, or if he did not anoint it with oil, it is valid. If the handful of one minhah was mixed with the handful of another, or with a priest\u2019s minhah, or with the minhah of the anointed high priest, or with the minhah offered with the libations, it is valid. Rabbi Judah says: if it was mixed with the minhah of the anointed high priest or with the minhah offered with libations, it is invalid, for since the consistency of the one is thick and the consistency of the other is thin, each absorbs from the other.","304":"Two minhahs from which the handfuls had not yet been taken out were mixed together: If it is still possible to take the handful from each separately, they are valid; If not, they are invalid. If the handful of a minhah was mixed with a minhah from which the handful had not yet been taken, he must not burn it. If he did burn it, then the minhah from which the handful had been taken fulfills the owner's obligation while the other from which the handful had not been taken does not fulfill the owner's obligation. If the handful was mixed with the remainder of the minhah or with the remainder of another  minhah, it must not be burned; If he did burn it does fulfill the owner's obligation. If the handful had become unclean and yet he offered it, the head plate renders it acceptable, But if it went out of the Temple Court and was afterwards he offered it, the headplate does not render it acceptable. For the headplate renders acceptable only an offering which was unclean but not that which was taken out.","305":"If the remainder of the minhah became unclean or was burnt or lost: According to the rule of Rabbi Eliezer it is valid to burn the fistful, But according to the rule of Rabbi Joshua it is invalid. If he did not put the fistful into a ministering vessel it is invalid; But Rabbi Shimon declares it valid. If he burnt the handful twice, it is valid.","306":"Regarding the handful: the absence of the smallest part invalidates the whole. Regarding the tenth of flour for the minhah the absence of the smallest part invalidates the whole. Regarding the wine libation which accompanies the minhah the absence of the smallest part invalidates the whole. Regarding the oil which is mixed in with the minhah the absence of the smallest part invalidates the whole. Regarding the flour and the oil, the absence of one invalidates the other. Regarding the handful and the frankincense, the absence of one invalidates the other.","307":"Regarding the two goats of Yom Hakippurim, the absence of one invalidates the other. Regarding the two lambs of Shavuot, the absence of one invalidates the other. Regarding the two loaves that accompany the lambs the absence of one invalidates the other. Regarding the two rows of the showbread the absence of one invalidates the other. Regarding the two dishes of frankincense the absence of one invalidates the other. Regarding the rows and the dishes the absence of one invalidates the other. Regarding the: two kinds of cakes used in the offering of the nazirite, the three kinds used for the red cow, the four kinds of cakes used in the todah, the four kinds of species used for the lulav, and the four kinds used for the purification of the leper, the absence of one invalidates the others. Regarding the seven sprinklings of the blood of the red cow the absence of one invalidates the others. Regarding the seven sprinklings between the staves of the ark, and of those towards the veil and upon the golden altar, the absence of one invalidates the others.","308":"Regarding the seven branches of the menorah, the absence of one invalidates the others. Regarding the seven lamps on it, the absence of one invalidates the others. Regarding the two portions of Scripture in the mezuzah, the absence of one invalidates the other; indeed even one letter can invalidate the whole. Regarding the four portions of Scripture in the tefillin, the absence of one invalidates the others; indeed even one letter can invalidate the whole. Regarding the four fringes, the absence of one invalidates the others, since the four together form one mitzvah. Rabbi Ishmael says: the four are four separate mitzvot.","309":"The absence of the blue in the tzitzit does not invalidate the white, neither does the absence of the white invalidate the blue. The absence of the hand-tefillin does not invalidate the head-tefillin, neither does the absence of the head-tefillin invalidate the hand-tefillin. The absence of the fine flour and the oil does not invalidate the wine, neither does the absence of the wine invalidate them. The omission of one of the sprinklings of the blood on the outer altar does not invalidate the rest.","310":"The absence of either the bullocks or the rams or the lambs does not invalidate the others. Rabbi Shimon says: if they had money enough to buy many bullocks but not enough for the drink-offerings, they should bring one bullock and its drink-offerings and should not offer them all without drink-offerings.","311":"The absence of the bull, or the rams, or the lambs or the goat does not invalidate the   bread, neither does the absence of the bread invalidate them. The absence of the bread invalidates the lambs, but the absence of the lambs does not invalidate the bread, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Shimon b. Nanas said: it is not so, but rather the absence of the lambs invalidates the bread, while the absence of the bread does not invalidate the lambs; for so we find that when the Israelites were in the wilderness for forty years they offered the lambs without the bread, therefore now too they may offer the lambs without the bread. Rabbi Shimon said: the halakhah is according to the words of Ben Nanas but not for the reason he stated; for every offering stated in the Book of Numbers was offered in the wilderness, but not every offering stated in the book of Leviticus was offered in the wilderness; however, when they came into the land of Israel they offered both kinds. Why then do I say that the lambs may be offered without the bread? Because the lambs render themselves permissible without the bread, whereas bread without lambs, there is nothing that renders it permissible.","312":"The absence of the daily offerings does not invalidate the additional offerings (musafin), neither does the absence of the additional offerings invalidate the daily offerings, neither does the absence of one of the additional offerings invalidate the other additional offerings. Even though they did not offer the tamid lamb in the morning they must offer the lamb towards evening. Rabbi Shimon said: When is this so? Only when they had acted under constraint or in error, but if they acted deliberately and did not offer the lamb in the morning they may not offer the lamb towards evening. If they did not burn the incense in the morning they burn it towards evening. Rabbi Shimon said: all of it was burned towards evening. For the golden altar was dedicated only by the incense of spices. And the altar for the olah by the daily offering of the morning, And the table only by the showbread on Shabbat, And the menorah only by the kindling of seven lamps towards evening.","313":"The high priest\u2019s griddle-cakes cannot be brought in two separate halves. Rather he must bring a whole tenth and then divide it, offering a half in the morning and a half towards evening. If a high priest offered half in the morning and then died and they appointed another priest in his place, the successor may not bring a half-tenth from his house, neither may he use the remaining half-tenth of the first high priest. Rather he must bring a whole tenth and divide it, and offer one half and leaving the other half goes to waste. It turns out that two halves are offered and two halves go to waste. If they did not appoint another priest in his place, at whose expense was it offered? Rabbi Shimon says, at the expense of the community; But Rabbi Judah says: at the expense of his heirs, And a whole tenth was offered.","314":"All minhahs must be offered unleavened, with the exception of the leavened cakes of the todah and the two loaves of Shavuot which are offered leavened. Rabbi Meir says: the leaven must be taken from the minhahs themselves and with this they are leavened. Rabbi Judah says: that is not the best way, rather first of all he brings leaven and puts into the measuring vessel and then he fills the measuring vessel up with flour. But they said to him: even so it is not satisfactory, for it would be sometimes too little and sometimes too much.","315":"All minhahs must be kneaded with lukewarm water and must be watched lest they become leavened. If one allowed the remainder to become leavened he has transgressed a negative commandment, for it is written, \u201cNo minhah which you shall bring to the Lord shall be made leavened\u201d (Leviticus 2:11). One is liable for the kneading, and for rolling and for baking.","316":"Some minhahs require oil and frankincense, some require oil but not frankincense, some frankincense but not oil, and some neither oil nor frankincense. These require oil and frankincense: the minhah of fine flour, that prepared on a griddle, that prepared in a pan, the cakes and the wafers, the minhah of the priests, the minhah of the anointed high priest, the minhah of a gentile, the minhah of women, and the minhah of the omer. The minhah offered with the drink-offerings requires oil but not frankincense. The showbread requires frankincense but not oil. The two loaves, the sinner's minhah and the minhah of jealousy require neither oil nor frankincense.","317":"One is liable for the oil on its own and for the frankincense on its own. If he put in oil, he has rendered it invalid, but if frankincense, he can remove it. If he put oil on the remainder, he has not transgressed a negative commandment. If he put one vessel above the other vessel, he has not rendered it invalid.","318":"Some minhahs require bringing near but not waving, some require bringing near and also waving, some require waving but not bringing near, and some require neither bringing near nor waving. These require bringing near but not waving: the minhah of fine flour, that prepared on a griddle, that prepared in a pan, the cakes and the wafers, the minhah of the priests, the minhah of the anointed high priest, the minhah of a gentile, the minhah of women, and the minhah of the omer. Rabbi Shimon says: the minhah of the priests and the minhah of the anointed high priest do not require bringing near, since no handful is taken out of them, and where no handful is taken out bringing near is not necessary.","319":"These require waving but not bringing near: The log of oil of the leper and his guilt-offering, The first fruits, according to Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, The innards of an individual\u2019s shelamim and its breast and thigh, whether they are the offerings of men or of women, by Israelites but not by others; The two loaves and the two lambs of Shavuot. How does he perform the waving? He places the two loaves upon the two lambs and puts his two hands beneath them and waves them forward and backward and upward and downward, for it is written, \u201cwhich is waved and which is lifted up\u201d (Exodus 29:27). The waving was performed on the east side of the altar and the bringing near on the west side. The ceremony of waving comes before that of bringing near. The minhah of the omer and the minhah of jealousy require bringing near and waving. The showbread and the minhah with the libations require neither bringing near nor waving.","320":"Rabbi Shimon says, there are three kinds of sacrifices which require three commandments; two of the three apply to each kind, but none of them require a third. And these are they: the shelamim of the individual, the shelamim of the community   and the asham of the leper. The shelamim of the individual requires the laying on of hands for the living animal and waving after it is slaughtered, but it does not require waving while alive. The shelamim of the community requires waving while alive and also after it is slaughtered, but it does not require the laying on of hands. The asham of the leper requires the laying on of hands and also waving while alive, but it does not require waving after it is slaughtered.","321":"One who says, \u201cI take upon myself to offer a minhah prepared on a griddle,\u201d he must not bring one prepared in a pan; If he says, I take upon myself to offer a minhah prepared in a pan,\u201d he must not bring one prepared on a griddle. What is the difference between a griddle mahabat and a pan marheshet?  The pan has a lid to it, but the griddle has no lid, the words of Rabbi Yose the Galilean. Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel says: a pan is deep and what is prepared is spongy; a griddle is flat and what is prepared on it is hard.","322":"If a man said, \u201cI take upon myself to offer a minhah baked in an oven,\u201d he must not bring what is baked in a stove or on tiles or in the cauldrons of the Arabs. Rabbi Judah says: he may bring what is baked in a stove. If he said, \u201cI take upon myself to offer a baked minhah,\u201d he may not bring half in loaves and half in wafers. Rabbi Shimon permits it for it is one kind.","323":"From the following menahot the handful must be taken and the remainder is for the priests: The minhah of fine flour, that prepared on a griddle, that prepared in a pan, the loaves and the wafers, the minhah of a Gentile, the minhah of women, the minhah of the omer, the sinners\u2019 minhah, and the minhah of jealousy. Rabbi Shimon says: a sinners\u2019 minhah brought by priests the handful is taken, and the handful is offered by itself and so also the remainder is offered by itself.","324":"The minhah of the priests, The minhah of the anointed high priest, And the minhah that is offered with the libations are wholly for the altar and the priests have no share in them; with these the altar is more privileged than the priests. The two loaves and the showbread are eaten by the priests and the altar has no share in them; with these the priests are more privileged than the altar.","325":"All menahot that are prepared in a vessel require three applications of oil: pouring, mixing and putting oil in the vessel, before they are completed. The baked cakes were mixed with oil, the words of Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi. But the sages say: the fine flour was mixed with oil. The loaves were mixed and the wafers anointed. How did he anoint them? In the form of a \u201cchi.\u201d And the rest of the oil was eaten by the priests.","326":"All menahot prepared in a vessel must be broken into pieces. The minhah of an Israelite was folded into two and the two were folded into four, and it was severed at each bend. The minhah of priests was folded into two and the two were folded into four, but it was not severed. The minhah of the anointed high priest was not folded. Rabbi Shimon says: neither the minhah of the priests nor the minhah of the anointed high priest was broken in pieces, since the handful was not taken from them, and whenever the handful is not taken from a minhah it is not to be broken in pieces. The pieces were the size of an olive.","327":"All menahot must be rubbed three hundred times and beaten five hundred times. The rubbing and the beating apply is performed with the grains of wheat. Rabbi Yose says: also to the dough. All menahot consist of ten cakes each, except the showbread and the griddle-cakes of the high priest, which consist of twelve cakes each, the words of Rabbi Judah. But Rabbi Meir says: they all consist of twelve cakes each, except the loaves of the todah and of the nazirite-offering, which consist of ten cakes each.","328":"The omer consisted of one tenth of an ephah of flour taken from three se'ahs. The two loaves consisted of two tenths taken from three se'ahs. And the showbread consisted of twenty-four tenths taken from twenty-four se'ahs.","329":"The omer was sifted through thirteen sieves, the two loaves through twelve, and the showbread through eleven. Rabbi Shimon says: there was no prescribed number for them, rather they brought fine flour and sifted it as much as was necessary, as it is said, \u201cYou shall take fine flour and bake it\u201d you should not bake it until it is sifted as much as is necessary.","330":"The todah required five Jerusalem seahs of flour, which are six wilderness seahs; This is the equivalent to two ephahs, for an ephah is three seahs, or to twenty tenths of an ephah, ten for the leavened cakes and ten for the matzot. \u201cTen for the leavened cakes\u201d one tenth for each cake; \u201cAnd ten for the matzot\u201d \u2013there were three kinds of matzot: loaves, wafers, and soaked cakes, thus there were three and a third tenths of flour for each kind, three cakes to every tenth. By Jerusalem measure they were thirty kavs, fifteen for the leavened cakes and fifteen for the matzot. \u201cFifteen for the leavened cakes\u201d, one kav and a half for each cake. \u201cAnd fifteen for the matzot\u201d  there were three kinds of matzot: loaves, wafers, and soaked cakes, thus there were five kavs for each kind, two cakes to every kav.","331":"The consecration minhah consisted of matzah like the todah: cakes, wafers, and soaked cakes. The nazirite minhah consisted of two thirds of the matzah of the todah: cakes and wafers, but not soaked cakes. Thus there were ten kavs by Jerusalem measure, which are six tenths and something over. From each kind the priest took one tenth part as terumah, as it is said, \u201cOut of this he shall offer one of each kind as a gift to the Lord\u201d (Leviticus 7:1: \u201cOne:\u201d that he may not take what is broken. \u201cOut of each offering:\u201d that each kind of offering shall be equal, and that he must not take the terumah from the one kind of offering on behalf of another. \u201cIt shall go to the priest who dashes the blood of the shelamim:\u201d and the rest was consumed by the owner.","332":"One who slaughtered the todah within the Temple court while its bread was outside the wall, the bread has not been sanctified. If he slaughtered it before the loaves had become crusted in the oven, even if all except one had become crusted, the bread is not sanctified. If he slaughtered the todah intending to eat it outside its proper time or outside its proper place, the bread is sanctified. If he slaughtered it and it was found to be terefah, the bread is not sanctified. If he slaughtered it and it was found to have a blemish: Rabbi Eliezer says: the bread is sanctified. But the sages say: it is not sanctified. If he slaughtered it under another name, and so, too, if the ram of the consecration-offering or the two lambs offered at Shavuot were slaughtered under another name, the bread is not sanctified.","333":"If a minhah that is accompanied by the libations had already been sanctified in a vessel when the animal-offering was found to be invalid: If there is another animal-offering, they may be offered with it; But if not, they are left to become invalid by remaining overnight. The offspring of a todah, its substitute, and the animal which was set apart in the place of the todah which was set apart and was lost, do not require the accompanying bread, as it says, \u201cAnd he shall offer them with the sacrifice of thanksgiving (todah)\u201d (Leviticus 7:1; the todah requires the accompanying bread, but its young, what is brought in its place, and its substitute, do not require the accompanying bread.","334":"One who says: \u201cBehold I take upon myself to bring a todah\u201d, he must bring both it and its bread from hullin. If he said: \u201cA todah from hullin and its bread from tithe,\u201d he must bring the bread from hullin. If he said: \u201cA todah from tithe and bread from hullin,\u201d he may bring. If he said: \u201cA todah, it and its bread from tithe,\u201d he may bring. But he must not bring from grain of second tithe, rather from second tithe money.","335":"From where is it derived that if one says, \u201cI take upon myself to bring a todah,\u201d he can bring it only from hullin? As it is said, \u201cAnd you shall sacrifice the pesah to the Lord your God, from the flock or the herd\u201d (Deuteronomy 16:. But is not the pesah sacrifice brought only from the lambs and from the goats? Why then is it written, \u201cfrom the flock or the herd\u201d? It is to compare whatever is brought from the flock and the herd with the pesah: just as the pesah is obligatory and offered only from what is hullin, so everything that is obligatory may be offered only from what is hullin. Therefore if a man says, \u201cI take upon myself to bring a todah,\u201d or \u201cI take upon myself to offer a shelamim,\u201d since in these cases these are obligatory they may be offered only from what is hullin. The libations in every case may be offered only from what is hullin.","336":"All the sacrifices communal or individual may be offered from produce grown in the Land of Israel or outside the Land, from new produce or from the old, except for the omer and the two loaves, which must be offered only from new produce and from produce grown in the land. All offerings must be offered from the choicest produce. And which is the choicest? That from Michmas and Zanoha are \u201calpha\u201d for the quality of their fine flour; second to them is Hafaraim in the valley. The produce of the whole land was valid, but they used to bring it from these places.","337":"One may not bring grain for menahot from the produce of a manured field or from an irrigated field or from a field stocked with trees. But if one did bring it from these it was valid. How was it prepared? In the first year it was plowed and in the second year it was sown seventy days before Pesah, thus it would produce fine flour in abundance. How was it tested? The temple-treasurer used to thrust his hand into it; if some dust came up in his hand it was invalid, until it was sifted more. If it had become magotty it is invalid.","338":"Tekoa is \u201calpha\u201d first its oil. Abba Saul says: Second to it is Regev, on the other side of the Jordan. The oil of the whole land was valid, but they used to bring it only from these places. One may not bring it from a manured field or from an irrigated field or from olive-trees   planted in a field sown with seeds, but if one did bring it from these it was valid. One may not bring anpakinon, and if one did bring it, it is invalid. One may not bring it from olive-berries which had been soaked in water or preserved or stewed; and if one did bring it, it is invalid.","339":"There are three periods of gathering in the olives and each crop gives three kinds of oil. The first crop of olives is when the olives are picked from the top of the tree; they are pounded and put into the basket. Rabbi Judah says: around the basket. This gives the first oil. They are then pressed with the beam Rabbi Judah says: with stones. This gives the second oil. They are then ground and pressed again. This gives the third oil. The first oil is fit for the candlestick and the others for menahot. The second crop is when the olives at roof-level are picked from the tree; they are pounded and put into the basket. Rabbi Judah says: around the basket. This gives the first oil. They are then pressed with the beam Rabbi Judah says: with stones. This gives the second oil. They are then ground and pressed again. This gives the third oil. The first oil is fit for the candlestick and the others for menahot. The third crop is when the last olives of the tree are packed inside the house until they become overripe; they are then taken up and dried on the roof they are pounded and put into the basket. Rabbi Judah says: around the basket. This gives the first oil. They are then pressed with the beam Rabbi Judah says: with stones. This gives the second oil. They are then ground and pressed again. This gives the third oil. The first oil is fit for the candlestick and the others for menahot.","340":"The first oil of the first crop, there is none better than it. The second oil of the first crop and the first oil of the second crop are equal. The third oil of the first crop, the second oil of the second crop and the first oil of the third crop are equal. The third oil of the second crop and the second oil of the third crop are equal. As to the third oil of the third crop, there is none worse than it. It would have been logical by the following argument that menahot should also require the purest olive oil: if the candlestick, whose oil is not for eating, requires pure olive oil, how much more should menahot, whose oil is for eating, require pure olive oil!  But the text states, \u201cPure olive oil of beaten olives for lighting\u201d (Exodus 27:20), but not \u201cpure olive oil of beaten olives for menahot.\u201d","341":"From where did they bring the wine? Keruhim and Attulim rank are alpha their wine. Second to them are Bet Rimmah and Bet Lavan on the mountain and Kefar Signa in the valley. Wine of the whole land was valid but they used to bring it only from these places. One may not bring it from a manured field or from an irrigated field or from vines planted in a field sown with seeds; but if one did bring it from these it was valid. One may not bring wine from sun-dried grapes, but if one did bring it, it was valid. One may not bring old wine, the words of Rabbi. But the sages permit it. One may not bring sweet wine or smoked wine or cooked wine, and if one did bring it, it was invalid. One may not bring wine from grapes suspended on reeds, but only from the vines growing close to the ground and from well-cultivated vineyards.","342":"They did not put the wine in large casks but in small barrels. And one did not fill the barrels to the brim so that its scent might spread. One may not take the wine at the mouth of the barrel because of the scum, nor that at the bottom because of the lees; but one should take it only from the third or the middle of the barrel. How was it tested?  The temple-treasurer used to sit nearby with his stick in his hand; when the froth burst forth he would knock with his stick. Rabbi Yose bar Judah says: wine on which there is a scum is invalid, for it is written, \u201cThey shall be for you without blemish, and their minhah,\u201d and \u201cThey shall be for you without blemish, and their libations\u201d (Numbers 28:19-20,.","343":"There were two dry-measures in the Temple: the tenth and the half-tenth. Rabbi Meir says: a tenth, another tenth, and a half-tenth. For what purpose did the tenth measure serve? By it they used to measure all the menahot. One did not measure with a three-tenths measure the minhah for a bull or with a two-tenths measure the minhah for a ram, rather, one measured them by all by tenths. For what purpose did the half-tenth measure serve? By it one used to measure the griddlecakes of the high priest which was offered half in the morning and the half towards evening.","344":"There were seven liquid measuring vessels in the Temple: the hin, the half-hin, the third-hin, the quarter-hin, the log, the half-log, and the quarter-log. Rabbi Eliezer bar Zadok says: there were markings in the hin measure indicating thus far for a bull, thus far for a ram, and thus far for a lamb. Rabbi Shimon says: there was no hin measure at all, for what purpose could the hin serve? But there was an additional measure of one and a half logs by which one used to measure the oil for the minhah of the high priest, a log and a half in the morning and a log and a half towards evening.","345":"For what purpose did the quarter-log serve? To measure a quarter-log of water for the one with skin disease and a quarter-log of oil for the Nazirite. For what purpose did the half-log serve? To measure a half-log of water for the sotah and a half-log of oil for the todah. With the log one measured the oil for all the menahot. Even a minhah of sixty tenths required sixty logs of oil. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: even a minhah of sixty tenths required only one log of oil, for it is written, \u201cFor a minhah, and for a log of oil\u201d (Leviticus 14:21). Six logs were required for a bull, four for a ram, and three for a lamb; Three logs and a half for the menorah, a half-log for each lamp.","346":"One may mix the drink-offerings of bulls with the drink-offerings of rams, or the drink-offerings of lambs with the drink-offerings of other lambs, or those of an individual offering with those of a communal offering, or those of an offering offered today with those of an offering offered yesterday; But one may not mix the drink-offerings of lambs with the drink-offerings of bulls or of rams. If they mixed these on their own, and they mixed these on their own, and then they were mixed, they are valid. But if before each was mixed by itself they were mixed together, they are invalid. Although the minhah of the lamb that was offered with the omer was doubled, its drink-offerings were not doubled.","347":"All the measures in the Temple were heaped except that used for the high priest's minhah which included in itself the heaped amount. The overflow of the liquid-measures was holy, but the overflow of the dry-measures was not holy. Rabbi Akiva says: the liquid-measuring vessels were holy, therefore their overflow was holy too; the dry-measuring vessels were not holy, therefore their overflow was not holy. Rabbi Yose says: it is not for that reason, but because liquids are stirred up and dry-stuffs are not.","348":"All the offerings of the congregation and of the individual require libations except the first-born animal, the cattle tithe of cattle, the pesah, the hatat and the asham; But the hatat and the asham of the one with skin disease do require libations.","349":"None of the communal offerings require the laying on of hands except the bull that is offered for the transgression by the congregation of any of the commandments, and the scapegoat. Rabbi Shimon says: also the he-goat offered for the sin of idol worship. All the offerings of an individual require the laying on of hands except the first-born, the cattle tithe, and the pesah. And an heir may lay his hands on his father\u2019s offering, and he may bring the libations for it, and can substitute another animal for it.","350":"All lay hands on the offering except a deaf-mute, an imbecile, a minor, a blind man, a gentile, a slave, an agent, or a woman. The laying on of hands is outside the commandment. One must lay the hands: On the head of the animal, Both hands In the place where one lays on the hands there the animal must be slaughtered; And the slaughtering must immediately follow the laying on of hands.","351":"Laying on of hands is in certain respects more stringent than waving and waving is in other respects more stringent than laying on of hands. For one may perform the waving on behalf of all the others, but one may not perform the laying on of hands on behalf of all the others. Waving is more stringent, for waving takes place for offerings of the individual and for offerings of the community, for living animals and for slaughtered animals, and for things that have life and for things that do not have life; but it is not so with laying on of the hands.","352":"Rabbi Ishmael says: On Shabbat the omer was taken out of three seahs of barley and on a weekday out of five. But the sages say: whether on Shabbat or on a weekday it was taken out of three seahs. Rabbi Hanina the vice-high priest says: on Shabbat it was reaped by one man with one sickle into one basket, and on a weekday it was reaped by three men into three baskets and with three sickles. But the sages say: whether on Shabbat or on a weekday it was reaped by three men into three baskets and with three sickles.","353":"The mitzvah of the omer is that it should be brought from what grows near by. If the crop near Jerusalem was not yet ripe, it could be brought from any place. It once happened that the omer was brought from Gagot Zerifin and the two loaves from the plain of En Soker.","354":"How would they do it reap the omer?The agents of the court used to go out on the day before the festival and tie the unreaped grain in bunches to make it the easier to reap. All the inhabitants of the towns near by assembled there, so that it might be reaped with a great demonstration. As soon as it became dark he says to them: \u201cHas the sun set?\u201d And they answer, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHas the sun set?\u201d And they answer, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWith this sickle?\u201d  And they answer, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWith this sickle?\u201d And they answer, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cInto this basket?\u201d And they answer, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cInto this basket?\u201d And they answer, \u201cYes.\u201d On the Sabbath he says to them, \u201cOn this Sabbath?\u201d And they answer, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOn this Sabbath?\u201d And they answer, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cShall I reap?\u201d   And they answer, \u201cReap.\u201d \u201cShall I reap?\u201d And they answer, \u201cReap.\u201d He repeated every matter three times, and they answer, \u201cyes, yes, yes.\u201d And why all of this? Because of the Boethusians who held that the reaping of the omer was not to take place at the conclusion of the first day of the festival.","355":"They reaped it, put it into the baskets, and brought it to the Temple courtyard; Then they would parch it with fire in order to fulfill the mitzvah that it should be parched with fire, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: they beat it with reeds or stems of plants that the grains should not be crushed, and then they put it into a pipe that was perforated so that the fire might take hold of all of it. They spread it out in the Temple courtyard so that the wind might blow over it. Then they put it into a gristmill and took out of it a tenth of an ephah of flour which was sifted through thirteen sieves. What was left over was redeemed and might be eaten by any one; It was liable for hallah but exempt from tithes. Rabbi Akiba made it liable both to hallah and to tithes. He then came to the tenth, put in its oil and its frankincense, poured in the oil, mixed it, waved it, brought it near to the altar, took from it the handful and burnt it; and the remainder was eaten by the priests.","356":"After the omer was offered they used to go out and find the market of Jerusalem already full of flour and parched grain of the new produce; This was without the approval of the rabbis, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: it was with the approval of the rabbis. After the omer was offered the new grain was permitted immediately, but for those that lived far off it was permitted only after midday. After the Temple was destroyed Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai decreed that it should be forbidden throughout the day of the waving. Rabbi Judah said: is it not so forbidden by the law of the Torah, for it is said, \u201cUntil this very day?\u201d Why was it permitted for those that lived far away from midday? Because they know that the court would not be negligent with it.","357":"The omer permits the new grain throughout the land, and the two loaves permit it in the Temple. One may not offer minhahs, first-fruits, or minhahs that accompany animal offerings, before the omer. And if one did so, it is invalid. Nor may one offer these before the two loaves. But if one did so it was valid.","358":"Wheat, barley, spelt, oats and rye are subject to hallah. And they are reckoned together. They are forbidden to be eaten as new grain before the omer. And they may not be harvested before Pesah. If they had taken root before the omer, the omer permits them; And if not, they are forbidden until the next year's omer.","359":"Before the omer one may reap grain in irrigated fields in the valley, but one may not stack it. The people of Jericho used to reap before the omer with the approval of the sages, and used to stack it without the approval of the sages, but the sages did not protest. One may reap the unripe grain for cattle feed. Rabbi Judah said: When is this so? If one had begun to reap it before it had reached a third of its growth. Rabbi Shimon says: one may reap it and feed his cattle with it even after it has reached a third of its growth.","360":"One may reap on account of the saplings or in order to make a house for mourners or in order not to interrupt the bet hamidrash. One may not bind them in bundles but one may leave them in small heaps. The mitzvah of the omer is that it should be brought from the standing grain. If this cannot be found he may bring it from the sheaves. The mitvah is that it should be brought from moist grain. If this cannot be found he may bring it from dry grain. The mitzvah is that it should be reaped at night. If it was reaped at day it is valid. And it overrides the Shabbat.","361":"The two loaves of Shavuot were kneaded each on its own and baked each on its own. The cakes of the showbread were kneaded each on its own and baked two at a time. They were prepared in a mould, and when they were taken out from the oven they were again put in a mould lest they become damaged.","362":"Both the two loaves and the showbread their kneading and their shaping were performed outside the Temple Court, and their baking was inside. And they do not override the Shabbat. Rabbi Judah says: all of these were performed inside the Temple Court. Rabbi Shimon says: One should always accustom himself to say, \u201cThe two loaves and the showbread were valid whether made in the Temple Court or in Bet Pagi.\u201d","363":"The high priest\u2019s griddle cakes: their kneading, their shaping, and their baking were performed within the Temple Court, And they override the Shabbat. The grinding of the grain for it and the sifting did not override the Shabbat. Rabbi Akiva said a general rule: any work that can be done on the eve of Shabbat does not override Shabbat, but that which cannot be done on the eve of Shabbat does override Shabbat.","364":"All menahot require a vessel for works that are performed within, but do not require a vessel for those works that are performed outside. How so? The two loaves were seven handbreadths long and four wide and their horns were four fingerbreadths. The cakes of the showbread were ten handbreadths long and five wide and their horns were seven fingerbreadths. Rabbi Judah says: lest you err remember but the words \u201czadad yahaz.\u201d Ben Zoma says: \u201cAnd you shall set upon the table showbread before me continually:\u201d panim signifies that it should have faces.","365":"The table was ten handbreadths long and five wide; the showbread was ten handbreadths long and five wide. Each cake was placed lengthwise across the breadth of the table, and two and a half handbreadths were turned up at either side so that its length filled the entire breadth of the table, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir says: the table was twelve handbreadths long and six wide; the showbread was ten handbreadths long and five wide. Each cake was placed lengthwise across the breadth of the table, and two handbreadths were turned up at either side; and there was a space of two handbreadths between the two sets so that the wind could blow between them. Abba Shaul says: there they used to put the two dishes of frankincense for the showbread. They said to him:  Has it not already been said, \u201cAnd you shall put pure frankincense upon al each row\u201d (Leviticus 24:7)? He replied, But has it not also been said, \u201cAnd next unto al him shall be the tribe of Manasseh\u201d (Numbers 2:20)?","366":"There were there four golden props at the corners of the table, each split at the top, which supported the cakes, two for the one row and two for the other row. And there were twenty-eight rods, each shaped like the half of a hollow reed, fourteen for the one row and fourteen for the other row. Neither the placing of the rods nor their removal overrode the Shabbat, but a priest used to enter on the day before Shabbat, pull out the rods, and place them parallel with the length of the table. Every article that stood in the Temple was placed with its length parallel with the length of the House.","367":"There were two tables inside the sanctuary, at the entrance of the Temple, the one of marble and the other of gold. On the table of marble they laid the showbread when it was brought in, and on the table of gold they laid the showbread when it was brought out, since we raise the status of what is holy and we don\u2019t lower it down. And within the sanctuary there was a table of gold on which the showbread lay continually. Four priests entered: two bearing the two rows of the showbread in their hands and two bearing the two dishes of frankincense in their hands; And four went in before them, two to take away the two rows of the showbread and two to take away the two dishes of frankincense. Those who brought them in stood at the north side facing the south, and those who took them away stood at the south side facing the north. These withdrew the old and the others laid down the new, the handbreadth of the one being by the side of the handbreadth of the other, as it is said, \u201cBefore me continually\u201d (Exodus 25:30). Rabbi Yose says: even if these first took away the old and the others laid down the new later on, this too fulfills the requirement of continually. They went out and laid the old bread on the table of gold that was in the sanctuary at its entrance. They then burned the dishes of frankincense and the loaves were distributed among the priests. If Yom Kippur fell on a Shabbat the cakes were distributed in the evening. If it fell on a Friday the he-goat of Yom Kippur was eaten in the evening. The Babylonian priests used to eat it raw for they were not fastidious.","368":"If he arranged the showbread on Shabbat and the dishes of frankincense on the day after Shabbat, and burned the dishes of frankincense on the next Shabbat, it is not valid, and one is not liable over it for piggul, remnant, or uncleanness. If he arranged the bread and the dishes of frankincense on Shabbat and burned the dishes of frankincense on the day after Shabbat, it is not valid, and one is not liable over it for piggul, remnant, or uncleanness. If he arranged the bread and the dishes of frankincense on the day after Shabbat and burned the dishes of frankincense on the next Shabbat, it is not valid. What should he do? He should leave it until the following Shabbat, for even if it remains many days on the table there is nothing to this.","369":"The two loaves were eaten never earlier than on the second day and never later than on the third day. How so? Normally they were baked on the day before the festival and eaten on the festival, that is, on the second day. If the festival fell on the day after Shabbat, they would be eaten on the third day. The showbread was eaten never earlier than on the ninth day and never later than on the eleventh day. How so? Normally it was baked on the day before Shabbat and eaten on Shabbat of the following week, that is on the ninth day. If a festival fell on the day before Shabbat, it would be eaten on the tenth day. If the two days of Rosh Hashanah fell before Shabbat, it would then be eaten on the eleventh day. Baking overrides neither Shabbat nor the festival. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, son of the deputy high priest: it overrides the festival but not the fast day (Yom Kippur).","370":"If menahot and libation-offerings became unclean before they were sanctified in a vessel, they may be redeemed. If they became unclean after they were sanctified in a vessel, they may not be redeemed. Bird-offerings, the wood, the frankincense, and the ministering vessels, may not be redeemed, for the rule of redemption applies only to offerings of beasts.","371":"If one said, \u201cI take upon myself to bring a minhah prepared on a griddle\u201d, and he brought one prepared in a pan, or \u201ca minhah prepared in a pan\u201d, and he brought one prepared on a griddle, what he has brought he has brought, but he has not fulfilled his obligation. But if he said, \u201cI take upon myself to bring this flour as a minhah prepared on a griddle\u201d, and he brought it prepared in a pan; or as \u201ca minhah prepared in a pan\u201d, and he brought it prepared on a griddle, it is invalid. If one said, \u201cI take upon myself to bring two tenths in one vessel\u201d, and he brought them in two vessels, or he said \u201cin two vessels,\u201d and he brought them in one vessel, what he has brought he has brought, but he has not fulfilled his obligation. But if he said, \u201cI take upon myself to bring these two tenths in one vessel\u201d, and he brought them in two vessels, or \u201cin two vessels\u201d, and he brought them in one vessel, they are invalid. If he said, \u201cI take upon myself to bring two tenths in one vessel\u201d and he brought them in two vessels, and when they said to him, \u201cYou vowed to bring them in one vessel\u201d, if he brought them in one vessel, they are valid, but if he still offered them in two vessels, they are invalid. If he said \u201cI take upon myself to bring two tenths in two vessels\u201d, and he brought them in one vessel, and when they said to him, \u201cYou vowed to bring them in two vessels\u201d, if he offered them in two vessels they are valid; but if he still kept them in one vessel, they are considered as two menahot which have been mixed.","372":"If one said, \u201cI take upon myself to bring a minhah of barley,\u201d he must bring one of wheat. \u201cOf coarse flour,\u201d he must bring it of fine flour. \u201cWithout oil and without frankincense,\u201d he must bring it with oil and frankincense. \u201cHalf a tenth,\u201d he must bring a whole tenth. \u201cA tenth and a half,\u201d he must bring two. Rabbi Shimon declares him exempt, because he did not make his offering in the manner in which people usually make their offerings.","373":"A man may offer a minhah consisting of sixty tenths and bring them in one vessel. If one said, \u201cI take upon myself to offer sixty-one tenths,\u201d he must bring sixty in one vessel and the one in another vessel, since the congregation brings on the first day of the festival of Sukkot when it falls on Shabbat sixty-one tenths as a minhah, it is enough for an individual that his minhah should be one tenth less than that of the congregation. Rabbi Shimon said: but some of these sixty-one tenths are for the bullocks and some for the lambs, and they may not be mixed one with the other! Rather sixty tenths mingles in one vessel. They said to him: can sixty be mingled in one vessel and not sixty-one? He answered, so it is with all the measures prescribed by the sages: a man may immerse himself in forty seahs of water, but he may not immerse himself in forty seahs less one kortob. One may not offer one log, two, or five logs, but one may offer three, four, six, or anything above six.","374":"One may offer wine but not oil, the words of Rabbi Akiva. But Rabbi Tarfon says: one may also offer oil. Rabbi Tarfon said: just as we find that wine is offered as an obligation may be offered as a freewill-offering, so oil which is offered as an obligation may be offered as a freewill-offering. Rabbi Akiva said to him: No, if you say so of wine it is because it is offered by itself even when offered as an obligation, can you say the same of oil which is not offered by itself when offered as an obligation? Two men may not jointly offer one tenth of flour for a minhah; but they may jointly offer an olah or a shelamim, and bird sacrifices even a single bird.","375":"One who says, \u201cI take upon myself to bring a tenth,\u201d he must bring one tenth. \u201cTenths,\u201d he must bring two tenths. If he said, \u201cI specified a certain number of tenths but I do not know what number I specified,\u201d he must bring sixty tenths If he said, \u201cI take upon myself to bring a minhah,\u201d he may bring whichever kind he chooses. Rabbi Judah says: he must bring a minhah of fine flour, for that is the distinctive one among the menahot.","376":"If he said \u201cA minhah\u201d or \u201ca kind of minhah,\u201d he may bring one of any kind. If he said  \u201cMenahot\u201d or \u201cA kind from menahot,\u201d he must bring two of any one kind. If he said, \u201cI specified a certain kind, but I do not know what kind I specified,\u201d he must bring the five kinds. If he said, \u201cI specified a minhah of a certain number of tenths but I do not know what number I specified,\u201d he must bring sixty tenths. But Rabbi says, he must bring menahot of every number of tenths from one to sixty.","377":"If one said, \u201cI take upon myself to bring pieces of wood,\u201d he must bring not less than two logs. \u201cFrankincense,\u201d he must bring not less than a handful. There are five cases of not less than a handful: One who says, \u201cI take upon myself to bring frankincense,\u201d he must bring not less than a handful. One who voluntarily offered a minhah must bring a handful of frankincense with it. One who offered up the handful outside the Temp is liable. The two dishes of frankincense require two handfuls.","378":"\u201cI take upon myself to offer gold,\u201d he must bring not less than a golden denar. \u201cSilver,\u201d he must bring not less than a silver denar. \u201cCopper,\u201d he must bring not less than the value of a silver maah. If he said \u201cI specified how much I would bring but I do not know what I specified,\u201d he must bring until he says, \u201cI certainly did not intend to give so much!\u201d","379":"If one said, \u201cI take upon myself to bring wine,\u201d he must bring not less than three logs. \u201cOil,\u201d he must bring not less than one log; Rabbi says: not less than three logs. If one said, \u201cI specified how much I would offer but I do not know how much I specified,\u201d he must bring that quantity which is the most that is brought on any one day.","380":"If one said, \u201cI take upon myself to offer an olah,\u201d he must bring a lamb. Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah say: he may bring a turtle-dove or a young pigeon. If he said, \u201cI specified a beast of the herd but I do not know what it was I specified,\u201d he must bring a bull and a calf. If he said, \u201cI specified a beast of the cattle but I do not know what it was I specified,\u201d he must bring a bull, a bull calf, a ram, a he-goat, a he-kid, and a he-lamb. If he said, \u201cI specified some kind but I do not know what it was I specified,\u201d he must add to these a turtle-dove and a young pigeon.","381":"If one said, \u201cI take upon myself to offer a todah or a shelamim,\u201d he must bring a lamb. If he said, \u201cI specified a beast of the herd but I do not know what it was I specified,\u201d he must bring a bull and a cow, a bull calf and a heifer. If he said, \u201cI specified a beast of the cattle but I do not know what it was I specified,\u201d he must bring a bull and a cow, a bull calf and a heifer, a ram and a ewe, a he-goat and a she-goat, a he-kid and a she-kid, a he-lamb and a ewe-lamb.","382":"If he said, \u201cI take upon myself to offer an ox,\u201d he must bring one with its drink-offerings to the value of a maneh. \u201cA calf,\u201d he must bring one with its drink-offerings to the value of five selas. \u201cA ram,\u201d he must bring one with its drink-offerings to the value of two selas. \u201cA lamb,\u201d he must bring one with its drink-offerings to the value of one sela. If he said \u201cAn ox valued at one maneh,\u201d he must bring one worth a maneh apart from its drink-offerings. \u201cA calf valued at five selas,\u201d he must bring one worth five selas apart from its drink-offerings. \u201cA ram valued at two selas,\u201d he must bring one worth two selas apart from its drink-offerings. \u201cA lamb valued at one sela,\u201d he must bring one worth one sela apart from its drink-offerings. If he said, \u201cI take upon myself to offer an ox valued at a maneh,\u201d and he brought two together worth a maneh, he has not fulfilled his obligation, even if one was worth a maneh less one denar and the other also was worth a maneh less one denar. If he said \u201cA black one\u201d and he brought a white one, or \u201ca white one\u201d and he brought a black one, or \u201ca large one\u201d and he brought a small one, he has not fulfilled his obligation. If he said \u201ca small one\u201d and he brought a large one, he has fulfilled his obligation; Rabbi says: he has not fulfilled his obligation.","383":"If one said, \u201cThis ox shall be an olah,\u201d and it becomes blemished, he may, if he so desires, bring two with its price. If he said, \u201cThese two oxen are for an olah,\u201d and they become blemished, he may, if he so desires, bring one ox with their price. But Rabbi forbids it. If he said, \u201cThis ram shall be an olah,\u201d and it becomes blemished, he may, if he so desires, bring a lamb with its price. If he said, \u201cThis lamb shall be an olah,\u201d and it becomes blemished, he may, if he so desires, bring a ram with its price thereof. But Rabbi forbids it. One who says, \u201cOne of my lambs shall be holy,\u201d or \u201cone of my oxen shall be holy,\u201d and he had only two, the larger one is holy. If he had three, the middle one is holy. If he said, \u201cI specified one but I do not know which it was I specified,\u201d or if he said, \u201cMy father told me that he had specified one but I do not know which it is,\u201d the largest one among them must be holy.","384":"If one said, \u201cI take upon myself to offer an olah,\u201d he must offer it in the Temple. And if he offered it in the Temple of Onias, he has not fulfilled his obligation. If one said, \u201cI take upon myself to offer an olah but I will offer it in the Temple of Onias,\u201d he must offer it in the Temple, yet if he offered it in the Temple of Onias he has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Shimon says: this is not an olah. If one said, \u201cI will be a nazirite,\u201d he must bring his offerings and shave his hair in the Temple. And if he brought them and shaved his hair in the Temple of Onias he has not fulfilled his obligation. If he said, \u201cI will be a nazirite but I will bring my offerings and shave my hair in the Temple of Onias,\u201d he must bring them in the Temple, yet if he brought them and shaved his hair in the Temple of Onias he has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Shimon says: such a one is not a nazirite. The priests who served in the Temple of Onias may not serve in the Temple in Jerusalem; and needless to say this is so of priests who served something else; for it is said, \u201cThe priests of the shrines, however, did not ascend the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem. But they did eat unleavened bread along with their kinsmen\u201d (II Kings 23:9). Thus they are like those that had a blemish: they are entitled to share and eat of the holy things but they are not permitted to offer sacrifices.","385":"It is said of the olah of cattle, \u201cAn offering made by fire of pleasing odor\u201d (Leviticus 1:9);   and of the olah of birds, \u201cAn offering made by fire of pleasing odor (vs. 17); and of the  minhah, \u201cAn offering made by fire of pleasing odor\u201d (Leviticus 2:2): to teach you that it is the same whether one offers much or little, so long as one directs one\u2019s heart to heaven. Congratulations!  We have finished Tractate Menahot! It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. It is no accident that the last mishnah of the tractate finishes with the message that we learned today. After having learned 14 chapters of Zevahim and 13 chapters of Menahot, there is a grave danger that one could learn that all God cares about, and all that is important in Judaism, is bringing the proper sacrifice in the proper manner. Our mishnah teaches that the important issue is the proper intent, that one\u2019s intent in sacrifice should be to worship God. This is not to deny that that the minutiae of rules are extremely important, both in the eyes of the rabbis and surely in the eyes of the priests who served in the Temple while it still stood. Rather, what today\u2019s mishnah seems to say is that the rules are an outer manifestation of the inner kavannah, intent, of the worshipper. Without following the rules, there is no way to bring that intent into the world. But without the intent, the rules are just empty exercises devoid of meaning. I believe that this is a message that is as true of Judaism today as it was in Temple times. Mishnah Menahot has probably been a great challenge for many of you; I know it was for me. So please accept an extra congratulations on completing it. Tomorrow we begin Hullin, the one tractate in all of Seder Kodashim that does not deal with sacrifices or the Temple.","386":"In three places the priests keep watch in the Temple: in the chamber of Avtinas, in the chamber of the spark, and in the fire chamber. And the Levites in twenty-one places: Five at the five gates of the Temple Mount; Four at its four corners on the inside; Five at five of the gates of the courtyard; Four at its four corners on the outside; One at the offering chamber; One at the chamber of the curtain, And one behind the place of the kapporet.","387":"The officer of the Temple Mount used to go round to every watch, with lighted torches before him, and if any watcher did not rise at his approach and say to him, \u201cShalom to you, officer of the Temple Mount, it was obvious that he was asleep. Then he used to beat him with his rod. And he had permission to burn his clothes. And the others would say: What is the noise in the courtyard? It is the cry of a Levite who is being beaten and whose clothes are being burned, because he was asleep at his watch. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob said: once they found my mother's brother asleep, and they burnt his clothes.","388":"There were five gates to the Temple Mount: The two Huldah gates on the south were used both for entrance and exit; The Kiponus gate on the west was used both for entrance and exit. The Taddi gate on the north was not used at all. The Eastern gate over which was a representation of the palace of Shushan and through which the high priest who burned the red heifer and all who assisted with it would go out to the Mount of Olives.","389":"There were seven gates in the courtyard: three in the north and three in the south and one in the east. In the south: the Gate of Kindling, and next to it the Gate of the First-borns, and then the Water Gate. In the east: the Gate of Nicanor. It had two chambers, one on its right and one on its left. One was the chamber of Pinchas the dresser and one the other the chamber of the griddle cake makers.","390":"On the north was the Gate of the Sparks which was shaped like a portico. It had an upper chamber built on it, and the priests used to keep watch above and the Levites below, and it had a door opening into the Hel. Next to it was the Gate of the Sacrifice and next to that the fire chamber.","391":"There were four chambers inside the fire chamber, like sleeping chambers opening into a hall, two in sacred ground and two in non-holy, and there was a row of mosaic stones   separating the holy from the non-holy. For what were they used? The one on the southwest was the chamber of sacrificial lambs, The one on the southeast was the chamber of the showbread. In the one to the northeast the Hasmoneans deposited the stones of the altar which the kings of Greece had defiled. Through the one on the northwest they used to go down to the bathing place.","392":"The fire chamber had two gates, one opening on to the Hel and one on to the courtyard. Rabbi Judah says: the one that opened on to the courtyard had a small opening through which they went in to search the courtyard.","393":"The fire chamber was vaulted and it was a large room surrounded with stone projections, and the elders of the clan serving in the Temple used to sleep there, with the keys of the Temple courtyard in their hands. The priestly initiates used to place their bedding on the ground.","394":"There was a place there in the fire chamber one cubit square on which was a slab of marble. In this was fixed a ring and a chain on which the keys were hung. When closing time came, the priest would raise the slab by the ring and take the keys from the chain. Then the priest would lock up within while the Levite was sleeping outside. When he had finished locking up, he would replace the keys on the chain and the slab in its place and put his garment on it and sleep there. If one of them had a seminal emission, he would go out by the winding stair which went under the Birah, and which was lighted with lamps on both sides, until he reached the bathing place. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: he descended by the winding stair which went under the Hel and he went out by the Taddi gate.","395":"The Temple Mount was five hundred cubits by five hundred cubits. The greater part of it was on the south; next to that on the east; next to that on the north; and the smallest part on the west. The part which was most extensive was the part most used.","396":"All who entered the Temple Mount entered by the right and went round to the right and went out by the left, save for one to whom something had happened, who entered and went round to the left. He was asked: \u201cWhy do you go round to the left?\u201d If he answered \u201cBecause I am a mourner,\u201d they said to him, \u201cMay He who dwells in this house comfort you.\u201d If he answered \u201cBecause I am excommunicated\u201d they said: \u201cMay He who dwells in this house inspire them to draw you near again,\u201d the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose to him: you make it seem as if they treated him unjustly. Rather they should say: \u201cMay He who dwells in this house inspire you to listen to the words of your colleagues so that they may draw you near again.\u201d","397":"Within it was the Soreg, ten handbreadths high. There were thirteen breaches in it, which had been originally made by the kings of Greece, and when they repaired them they enacted that thirteen prostrations should be made facing them. Within this was the Hel, which was ten cubits broad. There were twelve steps there. The height of each step was half a cubit and its tread was half a cubit. All the steps in the Temple were half a cubit high with a tread of half a cubit, except those of the Porch. All the doorways in the Temple were twenty cubits high and ten cubits broad except those of the Porch. All the doorways there had doors in them except those of the Porch. All the gates there had lintels except that of Taddi which had two stones inclined to one another. All the original gates were changed for gates of gold except the gates of Nicanor, because a miracle happened with them. Some say: because their copper gleamed like gold.","398":"All the walls that were there in the Temple were high except the eastern wall, for the priest who burned the red heifer would stand on the top of the Mount of Olives and direct his gaze carefully to see the opening of the Sanctuary at the time of the sprinkling of the blood.","399":"The courtyard of the women was a hundred and thirty-five cubits long by a hundred and thirty-five wide. It had four chambers in its four corners, each of which was forty cubits. They were not roofed, and so they will be in the time to come, as it says, \u201cThen he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court, and behold in every corner of the court there was a court. In the four corners of the court there were keturot courts\u201d and keturot means that they were not roofed. For what were they used? The southeastern one was the chamber of the Nazirites where the Nazirites used to boil their shelamim and shave their hair and throw it under the pot. The northeastern one was the wood chamber where priests with physical defects used to pick out the wood which had worms, every piece with a worm in it being unfit for use on the altar. The northwestern one was the chamber of those with skin disease. The southwestern one: Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob said: I forget what it was used for. Abba Shaul says: they used to store there wine and oil, and it was called the chamber of oil. It the courtyard of the women had originally been smooth without protrusions in the walls but subsequently they surrounded it with a balcony so that the women could look on from above while the men were below, and they should not mix together. Fifteen steps led up from it to the courtyard of Israel, corresponding to the fifteen songs of ascents mentioned in the Book of Psalms, and upon which the Levites used to sing. They were not rectangular but circular like the half of a threshing floor.","400":"There were chambers underneath the Court of Israel which opened into the Court of Women, where the Levites used to keep lyres and lutes and cymbals and all kinds of musical instruments. The Court of Israel was a hundred and thirty-five cubits in length by eleven in breadth. Similarly the Court of the Priests was a hundred and thirty-five cubits in length by eleven in breadth. And a row of mosaic stones separated the Court of Israel from the Court of the Priests. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: there was a step a cubit high on which a platform was placed, and it had three steps each of half a cubit in height. In this way the Court of the Priests was made two and a half cubits higher than that of Israel. The whole of the Court was a hundred and eighty-seven cubits in length by a hundred and thirty-five in breadth. And thirteen prostrations were made there. Abba Yose ben Hanan says: they were made facing the thirteen gates. On the south beginning from the west there were the upper gate, the gate of burning, the gate of the firstborn, and the water gate. And why was it called the water gate? Because they brought in through it the pitcher of water for libation on the festival. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: in it the water welled up, and in the time to come from there it will come out from under the threshold of the Temple. Corresponding to them in the north beginning in the west were the gate of Yehoniah, the gate of the offering, the women's gate, the gate of song. Why was it called the gate of Yehoniah? Because Yehoniah went forth into captivity through it. On the east was the gate of Nicanor; it had two doors, one on its right and one on its left. There were further two gates in the west which had no special name.","401":"The altar was thirty-two cubits by thirty-two. It rose a cubit and went in a cubit, and this formed the foundation, leaving thirty cubits by thirty. It then rose five cubits and went in one cubit, and this formed the surround, leaving twenty-eight cubits by twenty-eight. The horns extended a cubit in each direction, thus leaving twenty-six by twenty-six. A cubit on every side was allowed for the priests to go round, thus leaving twenty-four by twenty-four as the place for the wood pile for the altar fire. Rabbi Yose said: Originally, the complete area occupied by the altar was only twenty-eight cubits by twenty-eight, and it rose with the dimensions mentioned until the space left for the altar pile was only twenty by twenty. When, however, the children of the exile returned, they added four cubits on the north, and four on the west like a gamma, since it is said: \u201cNow the hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve broad, square\u201d (Ezekiel 43:16). Is it possible that it was only twelve cubits by twelve? When it says, \u201cWith four equal sides\u201d (ibid), this shows that he was measuring from the middle, twelve cubits in every direction. A line of red paint ran round it in the middle to divide between the upper and the lower blood. The foundation ran the whole length of the north and of the west sides, and it took up one cubit on the south and one on the east.","402":"At the southwestern corner of the foundation there were two openings like two small nostrils through which the blood which was poured on the western side of the foundation and on the southern side flowed down till the two streams became mingled in the channel,   through which they made their way out to the Kidron wadi.","403":"On the floor beneath at that corner there was a place a cubit square on which was a marble slab with a ring fixed in it, and through this they used to go down to the pit to clean it out. There was an ascent on the south side of the altar, thirty-two cubits long by sixteen broad. It had a square window in its western side where disqualified sin-offerings of birds were placed.","404":"The stones both of the ascent and of the altar were taken from the valley of Bet Kerem. They dug into virgin soil and brought from there whole stones on which no iron had been lifted, since iron disqualifies by mere touch, though a flaw made by anything could disqualify. If one of them received a flaw, it was disqualified, but the rest were not. They were whitewashed twice a year, once at Pesah and once at Hag, and the Sanctuary was whitewashed once a year, at Pesah. Rabbi says: they were whitewashed every Friday with a cloth on account of the blood stains. The plaster was not laid on with an iron trowel, for fear that it might touch and disqualify. Since iron was created to shorten man's days and the altar was created to prolong man's days, and it is not right therefore that that which shortens should be lifted against that which prolongs.","405":"There were rings to the north of the altar, six rows of four each. And some say, four rows of six each. Upon them they used to slaughter the sacrificial animals. The slaughter house was to the north of the altar, and on it were eight small pillars on top of which were blocks of cedar wood, in which were fixed hooks of iron, three rows in each, upon which they would hang the sacrifice and they would strip its hide on tables of marble that stood between the pillars. ","406":"The laver was between the porch and the altar, a little to the south. Between the porch and the altar there were twenty-two cubits. There were twelve steps there, each step being half a cubit high and a cubit broad. There was a cubit, a cubit and a level space of three cubits, then a cubit, a cubit and a level space of three cubits, then at the top a cubit, a cubit and a level space of four cubits. Rabbi Judah says that at the top there was a cubit, a cubit and a level space of five cubits.","407":"The doorway of the porch was forty cubits high and its breadth was twenty cubits. Over it were five main beams of ash wood. The lowest projected a cubit on each side beyond the doorway. The one above projected beyond this one a cubit on each side. Thus the topmost one was thirty cubits long. There was a layer of stones between each one and the next.","408":"There were poles of cedar wood stretching from the wall of the Sanctuary to the wall of the Porch to prevent it from bulging. There were chains of gold fixed in the roof beams of the Porch by which the priestly initiates used to ascend and see the crowns, as it says, \u201cAnd the crowns shall be to Helem and to Toviyah and to Yedaya and to Hen the son of Zephaniah as a memorial in the Temple of the Lord\u201d (Zechariah 6:14). A golden vine stood at the door of the Sanctuary trained on poles, and anyone who offered a leaf or a grape or a bunch used to bring it and hang it there. Rabbi Eliezer bar Zadok said: on one occasion three hundred priests were commissioned to clear it.","409":"The doorway of the Hekhal was twenty cubits high and ten broad. It had four doors, two on the inner side, and two on the outer, as it says, \u201cAnd the Hekhal and the Sanctuary had two doors\u201d (Ezekiel 41:23). The outer ones opened into the interior of the doorway so as to cover the thickness of the wall, while the inner ones opened into the Temple so as to cover the space behind the doors, because the whole of the Temple was overlaid with gold except the space behind the doors. Rabbi Judah says: they stood within the doorway, and they resembled folding doors. These were two cubits and a half of the wall and these were two cubits and a half, leaving half a cubit as a doorpost at the one end and half a cubit as a doorpost at the other end, as it says, \u201cAnd the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves, two leaves for the one door and two leaves for the other\u201d (Ezekiel 41:24).","410":"The great gate had two small doors, one to the north and one to the south. By the one to the south no one ever went in, and concerning it was stated explicitly be Ezekiel, as it says, \u201cAnd the Lord said to me: this gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it, for the Lord God of Israel has entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut\u201d (Ezekiel 44:2). He the priest took the key and opened the northern door and went in to the cell, and from the cell he went into the Hekhal. Rabbi Judah says: he used to walk along in the thickness of the wall until he came to the space between the two gates. He would open the outer doors from within and the inner doors from without.","411":"There were thirty-eight cells there, fifteen on the north, fifteen on the south, and eight on the west. On the north and on the south there were five over five and five again over these; On the west there were three over three and two over these. Each had three openings, one to the cell on the right and one to the cell on the left and one to the cell above. In the one at the northeastern corner there were five openings, one to the cell on the right, one to the cell above, one to the mesibbah, one to the door, and one to the Hekhal.","412":"The chamber of the lowest story was five cubits wide and at the ceiling six cubits. The chamber of the middle story was six cubits wide and at the ceiling of seven. The chamber of the top story was seven cubits wide, as it says, \"The lowest story was five cubits wide, the middle one 6 cubits wide and the third 7 cubits wide\" (I Kings 6:6).","413":"The mesibbah went up from the north-east corner to the north-west corner by which they used to go up to the roofs of the cells. One would ascend the messibah facing the west, traversing the whole of the northern side till he reached the west. When he reached the west he turned to face south and then traversed whole of the west side till he reached the south. When he reached the south he turned to face eastwards and then traversed the south side till he reached the door of the upper chamber, since the door of the upper chamber opened to the south. In the doorway of the upper chamber were two columns of cedar by which they used to climb up to the roof of the upper chamber, and at the top of them was a row of stones showing the division in the upper chamber between the holy part and the Holy of Holies. There were trap doors in the upper chamber opening into the Holy of Holies by which the workmen were let down in baskets so that they should not feast their eyes on the Holy of Holies.","414":"The Hekhal was a hundred cubits by a hundred with a height of a hundred. The foundation was six cubits, then it rose forty, then a cubit for the ornamentation, two cubits for the guttering, a cubit for the ceiling and a cubit for the plastering. The height of the upper chamber was forty cubits, there was a cubit for its ornamentation, two cubits for the guttering, a cubit for the ceiling, a cubit for the plastering, three cubits for the parapet and a cubit for the spikes. Rabbi Judah says the spikes were not included in the measurement, but the parapet was four cubits.","415":"From east to west was a hundred cubits: The wall of the porch five cubits, the porch itself eleven, the wall of the Hekhal six cubits and its interior forty, a cubit for the space between, and twenty cubits for the Holy of Holies, the wall of the Hekhal six cubits, the cell six cubits and the wall of the cell five. From north to south was seventy cubits: The wall of the mesibbah five cubits, the mesibbah itself three, the wall of the cell five and the cell itself six, the wall of the Hekhal six cubits and its interior twenty, then the wall of the Hekhal again six and the cell six and its wall five, then the place of the water descent three cubits and its wall five cubits. The Porch extended beyond this fifteen cubits on the north and fifteen cubits on the south, and this space was called the House of the slaughter-knives where they used to store the knives. The Hekhal was narrow behind and broad in front, resembling a lion, as it says, \"Ah, Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped\" (Isaiah 29:1): Just as a lion is narrow behind and broad in front, so the Hekhal was narrow behind and broad in front.","416":"The whole of the courtyard was a hundred and eighty-seven cubits long by a hundred and thirty-five broad. From east to west it was a hundred and eighty-seven. The space in which the Israelites could go was eleven cubits. The space in which the priests could go was eleven cubits. The altar took up thirty-two. Between the Porch and the altar was twenty-two cubits. The Hekhal took up a hundred cubits, and there were eleven cubits behind the kapporet.","417":"From north to south was a hundred and thirty-five cubits.The ascent and the altar took up sixty-two; From the altar to the rings was eight cubits. The rings took up twenty-four cubits. From the rings to the tables was four cubits, From the tables to the dwarf pillars four, And from the dwarf pillars to the wall of the courtyard eight cubits, And the remainder was between the ascent and the wall  and the space occupied by the dwarf pillars.","418":"There were six chambers in the courtyard, three on the north and three on the south. On the north were the salt chamber, the parvah chamber and the washer's chamber. In the salt chamber they used to keep the salt for the offerings. In the parvah chamber they used to salt the skins of the animal-offerings. On its roof was the bath used by the high priest on Yom Kippur. In the washers\u2019 chamber they used to wash the entrails of the sacrificial animals, and from it a winding way went up to the roof of the parvah chamber.","419":"On the south were the wood chamber, the chamber of the exile and the chamber of hewn stones. The wood chamber: Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: I forget what it was used for. Abba Shaul says: It was the chamber of the high priest, and it was behind the two of them, and one roof covered all three. In the chamber of the exile there was a fixed cistern, with a wheel over it, and from there water was provided for all of the courtyard. In the chamber of hewn stone the great Sanhedrin of Israel used to sit and judge the priesthood. A priest in whom was found a disqualification used to put on black garments and wrap himself in black and go away. One in whom no disqualification was found used to put on white garments and wrap himself in white and go in and serve along with his brother priests. They used to make a feast because no blemish had been found in the seed of Aaron the priest, and they used to say: Blessed is the Omnipresent, blessed is He, for no blemish has been found in the seed of Aaron. Blessed is He who chose Aaron and his sons to stand to minister before the Lord in the Holy of Holies.","420":"In three places the priests keep watch in the Temple: in the chamber of Avtinas, in the chamber of the spark, and in the fire chamber. In the chamber of Avtinas and in the chamber of the spark there were upper chambers where the youths kept watch. The fire chamber was vaulted and it was a large room surrounded with stone projections, and the elders of the clan serving in the Temple used to sleep there, with the keys of the Temple courtyard in their hands. The priestly initiates used to place their bedding on the ground. They did not sleep in their sacred garments, but they used to take them off and fold them and place them under their heads and cover themselves with their own ordinary clothes. If one of them had a seminal emission, he used to go out and make his way down the winding stairs which went under the Birah, and which was lit by lights on each side until he reached the bathing place. There was a fire close by and an honorable seat i.e. toilet: and this was its honor: if he found it locked, he knew there was someone there; if it was open, he knew there was no one there. He would go down and bathe and then come up and dry himself and warm himself in front of the fire. He would then go and take his seat next to his fellow priests until the gates were opened, when he would take his departure.","421":"Anyone who desired to remove the ashes from the altar used to rise early and bathe before the superintendent came. At what time did the superintendent come? He did not always come at the same time; sometimes he came just at cock-crow, sometimes a little before or a little after. The superintendent would come and knock and they would open for him, and he would say to them, let all who have bathed come and draw lots. So they drew lots, and whoever was successful.","422":"He took the key and opened the small door, and went from the fire chamber into the Temple courtyard, and the priests went in after him carrying two lighted torches. They divided into two groups, one of which went along the portico to the east, while the other went along it to the west. They went along inspecting until they came to the place where the griddle-cakes were made. There the two groups met and said, Is all well (shalom)? All is well (shalom)! They then appointed they that made the griddle-cakes to make griddle-cakes.","423":"The one who had merited to clear the ashes, would get ready to clear the ashes. They said to him: \u201cBe careful not to touch any vessel until you have washed your hands and feet from the laver. See, the fire-pan is in the corner between the ascent and the altar on the west of the ascent.\u201d No one entered with him, nor did he carry any light. Rather, he walked by the light of the altar fire. No-one saw him or heard a sound from him until they heard the noise of the wooden wheel which Ben Katin made for hauling up the laver, when they said, \u201cThe time has come.\u201d He washed his hands and feet from the laver, then took the silver fire-pan and went up to the top of the altar and cleared away the cinders on either side and scooped up the ashes in the centre. He then descended and when he reached the floor he turned his face to the north and went along the east side of the ascent for about ten cubits, and he then made a heap of the cinders on the pavement three handbreadths away from the ascent, in the place where they used to put the crop of the birds and the ashes from the inner altar and the ash from the menorah.","424":"When his fellow priests saw that he had descended, they came running and hastened to wash their hands and feet in the laver. They then took the shovels and the forks and went up to the top of the altar. The limbs and pieces of fat that had not been consumed since the evening they pushed to the sides of the altar. If there was not room on the sides they arranged them on the surround or on the ascent.","425":"They then began to throw the ashes on to the heap (tapuah). This heap was in the middle of the altar, and sometimes there was as much as three hundred kor on it. On festivals they did not use to clear away the ash because it was reckoned an ornament to the altar. It never happened that the priest was neglectful in taking out the ashes.","426":"They then began to take up the logs to place onto the fire. Were all kinds of wood valid for the fire? Yes! All kinds of wood were valid for the fire except vine and olive wood. But what they mostly used were boughs of fig trees and of nut trees and of oil trees.","427":"He then arranged a large pile on the east side of the altar, with its open side on the east, while the inner ends of the selected logs touched the ash heap. Spaces were left between the logs in which they kindled the brushwood.","428":"They picked out from there some good fig-tree branches to make a second fire for the incense near the south-western corner some four cubits to the north of it, using as much wood as he judged sufficient to form five seahs of coals, and on the Shabbat as much as he thought would make eight seahs of coals, because from there they used to take fire for the two dishes of frankincense for the showbread. The limbs and the pieces of fat which had not been consumed over night were put back on the wood. They then kindled the two fires and descended and went to the chamber of hewn stone.","429":"The superintendent then said to them: come and cast lots, to see who is to slaughter, and who is to sprinkle the blood, and who is to clear the ashes from the inner altar, and who is to clear the ash from the candlestick, and who is to lift the limbs on to the ascent: the head, the right leg, the two forelegs, the tailbone, the left leg, the breast and the neck and the two flanks, the entrails, the fine flour, the griddle cakes and the wine. They cast lots and whoever won, won.","430":"He then said to them: Go out and see if it is yet time for the slaughter. If the time had come, the one who saw would say, \u201cThere are flashes.\u201d Matya ben Samuel says: He used to say Has the whole of the east of the sky lit up. as far as Hebron? And he the observer would answer yes.","431":"He said to them: Go out and bring a lamb from the chamber of lambs. Now the lamb\u2019s chamber was in the north-western corner. And there were four chambers there   the chamber of lambs, the chamber of the seals, the chamber of the fire-room and the chamber where the showbread was prepared.","432":"They went into the chamber of the vessels and they took out ninety-three vessels of silver and gold. They gave the animal for the daily sacrifice a drink from a cup of gold. Although it had been examined on the previous evening it was now examined again by torchlight.","433":"The priest who had won the right to slaughter the tamid takes it along with him to the slaughter house, and those who had won the right to bring the limbs up followed after him. The slaughter house was to the north of the altar, and on it were eight small pillars on top of which were blocks of cedar wood, in which were fixed hooks of iron, three rows in each, upon which they would hang the tamid and they would strip its hide on tables of marble that stood between the pillars.","434":"Those who had won the right to clear the ashes from the inner altar and from the candlestick would go first with four vessels in their hands   the teni, the kuz and two keys. The teni resembled a large tarkav of gold and held two and a half kavs. The kuz resembled a large gold pitcher. And two keys: One of the two keys would reach down to the \u201camah of the armpit\u201d and the other opens immediately.","435":"He then came to the small opening on the north. The great gate had two small openings, one on the north and one on the south. No one ever went in by the openings on the south, about which it is stated explicitly in Ezekiel, \u201cAnd the Lord said to me, \u2018This gate shall be closed, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter by it, for the Lord God of Israel has entered by it\u201d (Ezekiel 44:2). He took the key and opened the small opening and went in to the cell and from the cell to the Sanctuary, until he reached the great gate. When he reached the great gate he drew back the bolt and the latches and opened it. The slaughterer did not slaughter till he heard the sound of the great gate being opened.","436":"From Jericho they could hear the sound of the great gate being opened. From Jericho they could hear the sound of the magrephah. From Jericho they could hear the noise of the wooden pulley which Ben Katin made for the laver. From Jericho they could hear the voice of Gevini the herald. From Jericho they could hear the sound of the pipes. From Jericho they could hear the sound of the cymbals. From Jericho they could hear the sound of the singing of the Levites. From Jericho they could hear the sound of the shofar. Some say also of the high priest when he pronounced the divine name on Yom Kippur. From Jericho they could smell the odor of the compounding of incense. Rabbi Elazar ben Diglai said: my father had some goats in Har Michvar, and they would sneeze from the smell of the incense.","437":"The one who had been chosen for clearing the ashes from the inner altar went in carrying the teni which he set down in front of it, and he scooped up the ash in his fists and put it into it, and in the end he swept up what was left into it, and then he left it there and went out. The one who had been chosen to clear the ashes from the menorah went in. If he found the two eastern lights burning, he cleared the ash from the rest and left these two burning. If he found that these two had gone out, he cleared away their ash and kindled them from those which were still lit and then he cleared the ash from the rest. There was a stone in front of the candlestick with three steps on which the priest stood in order to trim the lights. He left the kuz on the second step and went out.","438":"They would not tie up the lamb but rather they would string its legs together. Those who merited to bring up the limbs took hold of it. Thus it was strung up: its head was to the south while its face was turned to the west. The slaughterer stood to the east of it, facing the west. The morning tamid was killed by the north-western corner of the altar at the second ring. The evening tamid was killed by the north-eastern corner at the second ring. While one slaughtered another received the blood. He then proceeded to the north-eastern corner and cast the blood on the eastern and northern sides; he then proceeded to the southwestern corner and cast the blood on the western and southern sides. The remnant of the blood he poured out at the southern base of the altar.","439":"He did not use to break the leg, but he made a hole in it at the knee- joint and suspended it from there. He then began to flay it until he came to the breast. When he came to the breast he cut off the head and gave it to the one who merited bringing it onto the ramp. He then cut off the legs up to the knees and gave them to the one who merited bringing them onto the ramp. He then finished the flaying. He tore out the heart and squeezed out the blood in it. He then cut off the forelegs and gave them to the one who merited bringing them onto the ramp. He then went back to the right leg and cut it off and gave it to the one who merited to bring it onto the ramp, and the two testicles with it. He then tore it the remaining carcass open so that it was all exposed before him. He took the fat and put it on top of the place where the head had been severed. He took the innards and gave them to the one to who had merited washing them. The stomach was washed very thoroughly in the washing chamber, while the entrails were washed at least three times on marble tables which stood between the pillars.","440":"He then took a knife and separated the lung from the liver and the finger of the liver from the liver, but he did not remove it from its place. He cut out the breast and gave it to the one who had merited bringing it onto the ramp. He came to the right flank and cut into it as far as the spine, without touching the spine, until he came to the place between two small ribs. He cut it off and gave it to the one who had merited bringing it onto the ramp, with the liver attached to it. He then came to the neck, and he left two ribs on each side of it, cut it off and gave it to the one who had merited bringing it onto the ramp, with the windpipe and the heart and the lung attached to it. He then came to the left flank in which he left the two thin ribs above and two thin ribs below; and he had done similarly with the other flank. Thus he left two on each side above and two on each side below. He cut it off and gave it to the one who had merited bringing it onto the ramp, and the spine with it and the spleen attached to it. This was really the largest piece, but the right flank was called the largest, because the liver was attached to it. He then came to the tail bone, which he cut off and gave it to the one who had merited bringing it onto the ramp, along with the tail, the finger of the liver and the two kidneys. He then took the left leg and cut it off and gave it to the one who had merited bringing it onto the ramp. Thus they were all standing in a row with the limbs in their hands The first had the head and the right hind leg. The head was in his right hand with its nose towards his arm, its horns between his fingers, and the place where it was severed turned upwards with the fat covering it. The right leg was in his left hand with the place where the flaying began turned away from him. The second had the two fore legs, the right leg in his right hand and the left leg in his left hand, the place where the flaying began turned away from him. The third had the tail bone and the other hind leg, the tail bone in his right hand with the tail hanging between his fingers and the finger of the liver and the two kidneys with it, and the left hind leg in his left hand with the place where the flaying began turned away from him. The fourth had the breast and the neck, the breast in his right hand and the neck in his left hand, its ribs being between two of his fingers. The fifth had the two flanks, the right one in his right hand, and the left one in his left hand, with the place where the flaying began turned away from him. The sixth had the innards on a platter with the knees on top of them. The seventh had the fine flour. The eighth had the griddle cakes. The ninth had the wine. They went and placed them on the lower half of the ramp on its western side, and salted them (see Leviticus 2:13). They then came down and went to the Chamber of Hewn Stone to recite the Shema.","441":"The superintendent said to them: Bless one blessing!  And they blessed. They then read the Ten Commandments, the Shema, the \u201cAnd it will be if you hearken\u201d and Vayomer (the third paragraph of Shema), and they blessed the people with three blessings: Emet veYatziv, and Avodah, and the priestly benediction. On Shabbat they added a blessing to be said by the watch which was leaving.","442":"He said to them: those who are new to the incense come and draw lots, and who ever won, won. He then said: new and old, come and draw lots to see who shall take up the limbs from the ascent to the altar. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: the one who brought the limbs on to the ascent also takes them up to the altar.","443":"He then handed them over to the attendants, who stripped them of their garments, and they would leave on them only the pants. There were windows there on which was inscribed the name of the garment to which each was assigned.","444":"The one who had been selected to offer the incense took up the ladle, which was in shape like a big tarkav of gold, and it held three kavs, And the small dish was in the middle of it, heaped up with incense. This had a covering, over which was spread a piece of cloth.","445":"The priest who had won the firepan, would take the silver pan and ascend to the top of the altar and clear away the live coals to this side and that, and he would rake the coals. He then went down and poured them into a gold firepan. About a kav of the coals was spilt, and these he swept into the channel. On Shabbat he used to put an overturned pot on them. This pot was a large vessel which could hold a letekh. It had two chains; with one he used to draw it down, and with the other he used to hold it above so that it should not roll over. It was used for three purposes   for placing over live coals, and over a dead creeping thing on Shabbat, and for drawing down the ashes from the top of the altar.","446":"When they came between the Sanctuary and the altar, one took the magrefah and threw it between the Sanctuary and the altar. People could not hear one another speak in Jerusalem from the noise of the magrefah. It served three purposes: When a priest heard the sound of it he knew that his fellow priests were going in to bow down, and he would run to join them. When a Levite heard the noise he knew that his fellow Levites were going in to sing, and he would run to join them. And the head of the Ma\u2019amad used to make the unclean stand in the east gate.","447":"They began to ascend the steps of the Sanctuary. Those who had won the right to clear the ashes from the inner altar and from the candlestick went in front. The one who won the right to clear the inner altar went in and took the teni and bowed down and went out again. The one who had been chosen to clear the candlestick went in, and if he found the two eastern lights still burning he cleared out the eastern one and left the western one burning, since from it he lit the candlestick for the evening. If he found that this one had gone out, he cleared the ash away and lit it from the altar of burnt-offering. He then took the kuz from the second step and bowed down and went out.","448":"The one who had won the right to bring in the firepan made a heap of the coals on the top of the altar and then spread them about with the end of the firepan and bowed down and went out.","449":"The one who had won the right to the incense took the dish from the middle of the spoon and gave it to his friend or his relative. If some of it spilled into the spoon, he would put it into his hands. They used to instruct him: Be careful not to begin immediately in front of you or else you may burn yourself. He then began to scatter the incense and after finishing went out. The one who burned the incense did not do so until the superintendent said to him: burn the incense. If it was the high priest who burned: he would say to him: Sir, high priest, burn the incense. Everyone left and he burned the incense and bowed down and went out.","450":"When the high priest went in to bow down, three priests supported him, one by his right and one by his left and one by the precious stones. When the superintendent heard the sound of the footsteps of the high priest as he was about to go out from the Sanctuary, he raised the curtain for him. He went in, bowed down and went out, and then his fellow priests went in and bowed down and went out.","451":"They went and stood on the steps of the Sanctuary. The first ones stood at the south side of their fellow priests with five vessels in their hands: one held the teni, the second the kuz, the third the firepan, the fourth the dish, and the fifth the spoon and its covering. They blessed the people with a single blessing, except in the country they recited it as three blessings, in the Temple as one. In the Temple they pronounced the divine name as it is written, but in the country by its substitute. In the country the priests raised their hands as high as their shoulders, but in the Temple above their heads, except the high priest, who did not raise his hands above the diadem. Rabbi Judah says: the high priest also raised his hands above the diadem, since it says, \u201cAnd Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them\u201d (Leviticus 9:22).","452":"If the high priest wished to burn the offerings himself, he would go up the ascent with the deputy high priest at his right. When he reached the middle of the ascent the deputy took hold of his right hand and helped him up. The first of the other priests then handed to him the head and the foot and he laid his hands on them and threw them onto the altar. The second then handed to the first the two fore legs. And he handed them to the high priest who laid his hands on them and threw them onto the altar. The second then went away. In the same way all the other limbs were handed to him and he laid his hands on them and threw them on to the altar fire. If he wanted, he could lay his hands and let others throw them on the fire. He then went around the altar. From where did he begin? From the southeastern corner; from there he went to the northeastern, then to the northwestern and then to the southwestern. They there handed him the wine for libation. The deputy high priest stood on the corner\/horn of the altar with the flags in his hand, and two priests on the table of the fats with two trumpets in their hands. They blew a teki\u2019ah, a teru\u2019ah and a teki\u2019ah. They then went and stood by Ben Arza, one on his right hand and one on his left. When he bent down to make the libation the deputy high priest waved the flags and Ben Arza struck the cymbals and the Levites sang the psalm. When they came to a pause they blew a teki\u2019ah, and the public bowed down. At every pause there was a teki\u2019ah and at every teki\u2019ah a bowing down. This was the order of the regular daily sacrifice for the service of our Lord. May it be His will that it be rebuilt speedily in our days, Amen.","453":"The following are the psalms that were chanted in the Temple.On the first day they used to say, \u201cThe earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the world and they that dwell therein\u201d (Psalms. On the second day they used to say: \u201cGreat is the Lord and highly to be praised, in the city of our God. His holy mountain\u201d (Psalms. On the third day they used to say: \u201cGod stands in the congregation of God, in the midst of the judges he judges\u201d (Psalms. On the fourth day they used to say: \u201cO Lord, God to whom vengeance belongs. God to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth\u201d (Psalms. On the fifth day they used to say: \u201cSing aloud unto God our strength, shout unto the God of Jacob\u201d (Psalms. On the sixth day they used to say: \u201cThe lord reigns, he is clothed in majesty, the Lord is clothed, He has girded himself with strength\u201d (Psalms. On Shabbat they used to say: \u201cA psalm, a song for the Sabbath day\u201d (Psalms.  A psalm, a song for the time to come, for the day that will be all Shabbat and rest for everlasting life. ","454":"All persons can substitute, both men and women. Not that one is permitted to substitute, but that if one did so, the substitute is sacred, and he receives forty lashes. Priests have the power to substitute their own animal and Israelites also have the power to substitute their own animal. Priests do not have the power to substitute a hatat, an asham or a first-born: Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri: what is the reason priests do not have the power to substitute a first-born? Rabbi Akiva said: a hatat and an asham are priestly gifts and a first-born is also a priestly gift. Just as in the case of a hatat and an asham priests have no power to substitute them, so in the case of a first-born priests have no power to substitute it. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said to him: So what that priests should have no power to substitute a hatat and an asham, for there they have do not have a claim on these offerings while they are alive. How can you say that the same applies to a first-born upon which the priests do have a claim when it is alive? Rabbi Akiva replied to him: Has not Scripture already said: \u201cThen it and its substitute shall be holy?\u201d (Leviticus 27:10).  Now where does the holiness of the original animal occur? In the house of the owners; so too the substitution occurs in the house of the owners.","455":"One can substitute Herd animals for flock animals and flock animals for herd animals; Sheep for goats and goats for sheep; Males for females and females for males; Unblemished animals for blemished animals and blemished animals for unblemished animals, since Scripture says: \u201cOne may not exchange or substitute another for it, either good for bad, or bad for good\u201d (Leviticus 27:10). What is meant by \u201cgood for bad\u201d? Blemished animals whose dedication was prior to their blemish. One can substitute one hullin animal for two consecrated animals, and two hullin animals for one consecrated animal; One hullin animal for a hundred consecrated animals and a hundred hullin animals for one consecrated animal; Rabbi Shimon says: one can only substitute one for one, as it says, \u201cThen it and its substitute\u201d (ibid), just as \u201cit\u201d the consecrated animal is only one, so its substitute must also be only one.","456":"One cannot substitute limbs of hullin for dedicated embryos; Or embryos of hullin for dedicated limbs; Or embryos and limbs of hullin for whole dedicated animals; Or whole animals of hullin for them. Rabbi Yose says: limbs of hullin can be substituted for whole dedicated animals, but whole animals of hullin cannot be substitute for them. Rabbi Yose said: When it comes to dedicating animals, is it not true that if one says: \u201cThis foot shall be an olah (a burnt offering),\u201d the whole animal becomes an olah? Similarly, if one says, \u201cThis foot shall be in place of this whole dedicated animal,\u201d the whole animal should become a substitute in its place!","457":"Anything which has become subject to the law of terumah through a mixture can affect a second mixture only in proportion. Dough leavened through terumah can affect other dough only in proportion. Drawn water can disqualify a mikweh only in proportion.","458":"Hatat water does not become hatat water except with the putting of ashes in the water. A doubtful graveyard cannot make another doubtful graveyard. Nor can terumah be made after terumah. A substitute cannot make another substitute. The offspring of a dedicated animal cannot make a substitute. Rabbi Judah says: the offspring of a dedicated animal can make a substitute. They said to him: a dedicated animal can make a substitute, but neither the offspring of a dedicated animal nor a substitute can make a substitute.","459":"Birds and menahot do not make a substitute, since it only says \u201ca beast\u201d (Leviticus 27:10). A congregation or partners cannot make a substitute, since it says: \u201cHe shall not substitute for it\u201d an individual can make a substitute but a congregation or partners cannot make substitute. One cannot make a substitute with objects dedicated for Temple repairs. Rabbi Shimon said:  Now is not tithe included in the laws of substitutes? Then why was it specially mentioned?  In order to make a comparison with it: tithe is a private offering, it thus excludes congregational offerings. And tithe is a dedication for the altar, it thus excludes offerings dedicated for Temple repairs.","460":"There are laws relating to the sacrifices of an individual which do not apply to congregational sacrifices and laws relating to congregational sacrifices which do not apply to the sacrifices of individuals. For sacrifices of an individual can make a substitute whereas congregational sacrifices cannot make a substitute; Sacrifices of an individual can be either males or females, whereas congregational sacrifices can be only males. For sacrifices of an individual the owner is responsible for them and their libations, whereas for congregational sacrifices they are not liable for them or for their libations, although they are liable for their libations once the sacrifice has been offered. There are laws relating to congregational sacrifices which do not apply to the sacrifices of individuals: For congregational sacrifices override Shabbat and the laws of ritual impurity, whereas sacrifices of individuals do not override the Shabbat or the laws of ritual impurity. Rabbi Meir said: but do not the griddle cakes of a high priest and the bull for Yom Hakippurim  which are sacrifices of individuals and yet override the Shabbat and the laws of ritual impurity? The matter therefore depends on whether the time for the offering up is fixed.","461":"A hatat of an individual whose owners have been atoned for is left to die, whereas that of a congregation is not left to die. Rabbi Judah says: it is left to die. Rabbi Shimon said: Just as we have found with regard to the offspring of a hatat, the substitute of a hatat and a hatat whose owners died, that these rules apply only to an individual but not to a congregation, so too the rules concerning the hatat whose owners have been atoned for and a hatat whose year has passed apply only to an individual but not a congregation.","462":"In some ways the laws relating to dedications are more stringent than that those relating to a substitute, and in some ways those relating to a substitute are more stringent than those relating to dedications. In some ways the laws relating to dedications are more stringent than those relating to a substitute, For dedicated animals can make a substitute whereas a substitute cannot make another substitute. A congregation or partners can dedicate but cannot make a substitute. One can dedicate embryos and limbs, but one cannot make a substitute with them. The laws relating to a substitute are more stringent than those relating to dedications, since a substitute applies to a permanently blemished animal and it does not become hullin to be sheared or worked. Rabbi Yose son of Rabbi Judah says: they made an error to be the same as intent when it comes to a substitute, but they did not make an error to be the same as intent when it comes to dedication. Rabbi Elazar says: kilayim, terefah, a fetus extracted by means of a cesarean section, a tumtum and a hermaphrodite, cannot become sacred nor can they make sacred.","463":"The following are sacrifices whose offspring and substitutes are the same as them:The offspring of shelamim and their substitutes, their offspring and the offspring of their offspring, till the end of time, are regarded as shelamim, and they require the laying on of hands, libations and the waving of the breast and shoulder. Rabbi Eliezer says: the offspring of a shelamim must not be offered as a shelamim. The sages say: it is offered. Rabbi Shimon said: there is no dispute between them as regards the offspring of the offspring of a shelamim or the offspring of the offspring of a substitute that they are not offered. What did they dispute? The offspring of a shelamim: Rabbi Eliezer says: it is not offered, But the sages say: it is offered. Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Papias testified regarding the offspring of a shelamim that it is offered as a shelamim. Rabbi Papias said: I testify that we had a cow of a shelamim and we ate it on Pesah and we ate its offspring as a shelamim on the festival of Sukkot.","464":"The offspring of a todah and its substitute, their offspring and the offspring of their offspring, until the end of all time, are considered as a todah, only they do not require the accompaniment of loaves of bread. The substitute of an olah, the offspring of its substitute, its offspring and the offspring of its offspring, until the end of time, are regarded as an olah: they require flaying, cutting into pieces and to be altogether burned.","465":"If one set aside a female animal for an olah and it gave birth to a male, it goes out to pasture until it becomes unfit for sacrifice. It is then sold and with its money he brings an olah. Rabbi Elazar says: the male animal itself is offered as an olah. If one sets aside a female animal for an asham, it goes out to pasture until it becomes unfit for sacrifice. It is then sold and with its money he brings an asham. If he has already offered an asham in its place, its money goes for freewill-offerings. Rabbi Shimon says: it is sold without waiting for a blemish. The substitute of an asham, the young of its substitute, their young and the young of their young until the end of time, go out to pasture until unfit for sacrifice. They are then sold and their money goes for a freewill-offering. Rabbi Eliezer says: they are left to die. Rabbi Elazar says: he brings olot burnt sacrifices with their money. An asham whose owner died or whose owner obtained atonement through another animal goes out to pasture until unfit for sacrifice. It is then sold and its money goes for freewill-offerings. Rabbi Eliezer says: they are left to die. Rabbi Elazar says: he brings olot burnt sacrifices with their money.","466":"But cannot a nedavah freewill-offering also be an olah? What then is the difference between the opinion of Rabbi Elazar and that of the sages? Only in that when the offering comes as an obligation, he lays his hands on it and he brings libations and the libations must be from him; and if he is a priest, the privilege of officiating and its hide belong to him. Whereas when he brings it as a freewill-offering, he does not lay his hands on it, he does not bring libations with it, the libations are provided by the congregation, and although he is a priest, the privilege of officiating and its hide belong to the men of the division officiating that particular week.","467":"The substitute of a first-born and an animal tithed, their young and the young of their young until the end of time, they are all treated like a first-born and an animal tithed, and are eaten by the owners when blemished. What is the difference between a first-born and an animal tithed on the one hand and other dedications on the other? All blemished dedications are sold in the market, killed in the market, and weighed by the pound, but not a first-born and an animal tithed. They other dedications and their substitutes are redeemed, but not a first-born and an animal tithed. They other dedications come from outside the land to the land, but not a first-born and an animal tithed. If they however came from outside the holy land unblemished, they are offered, if blemished they are eaten by their owners with their blemishes. Rabbi Shimon: what is the reason?   Because a first-born and an animal tithed have a remedy wherever they are, whereas all other dedications, although a blemish has occurred in them, remain holy.","468":"The offspring of a hatat, the substitute of a hatat, and a hatat whose owner has died, are left to die. A hatat whose year has passed or which was lost and found blemished: If the owners obtained atonement afterwards, through another animal, is left to die, and it does not make a substitute; it is forbidden to derive benefit from it, but the laws of sacrilege do not apply. If the owners have not yet obtained atonement, it must go to pasture until it becomes unfit for sacrifice. It is then sold and another is bought with the money. It makes a substitute, and the laws of sacrilege do apply.","469":"If one set aside a hatat and it was lost and he sacrificed another in its place, if then the first animal is found, it is left to die. If one set aside money for his hatat and they were lost and he offered a hatat instead of it, if then the money was found, it goes to the Dead Sea.","470":"If one set aside money for his hatat, and it was lost and he set aside other money in its place, if he did not have the opportunity to buy a hatat with it until the first money was found, he brings a hatat from both sums, and the rest of the money is used for a freewill-offering. If one set aside money for his hatat and it was lost and he set aside a hatat in its place, if he did not have the opportunity to offer it until the money was found, and the hatat was blemished, it is sold and he brings a hatat from both sums, and the rest is used as a freewill-offering. If one set aside a hatat and it was lost and he set aside money in its place, if he did not have the opportunity to buy a hatat until his hatat was found and it was blemished, it is sold and he brings a hatat from both sums, and the rest is used for a freewill-offering. If one set aside a hatat and it was lost and he set aside another hatat in its place, if he did not have the opportunity to offer it until the first hatat was found and both were blemished, they are to be sold and he brings a hatat from both sums and the rest is used for a freewill-offering. If one set aside a hatat and it was lost and he set aside another in its place, if he did not have the opportunity of offering it until the first hatat was found and both animals were unblemished, one of them is offered as a hatat and the second must be left to die, the words of Rabbi. The sages say: the only hatat which is left to die is a case where it is found after the owners obtained atonement, and the money does not go to the Dead Sea except where found after the owners have obtained atonement.","471":"If one set aside a hatat and it is blemished, he sells it and brings another with its money. Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Shimon says: if the second animal was offered before the first was killed, it is left to die, since the owners have already obtained atonement.","472":"How can we act deceptively with regard to the first-born?He says in respect of a pregnant animal which was giving birth for the first time: if what is in the inside of this animal is a male, let it be an olah. If it then gave birth to a male, it is offered as an olah. If he said: if it is a female, let it be a shelamim, then if it gave birth to a female, it is offered as a shelamim. If he said: if it is a male, let it be an olah, and if a female let it be a shelamim, then if it gave birth to a male and a female, the male is offered as an olah and the female is offered as a shelamim.","473":"If it gave birth to two males, one of them shall be offered as an olah and the second shall be sold to persons obligated to bring an olah and its money becomes hullin. If it gave birth to two females, one of them is offered as a shelamim and the second is sold to persons obligated to bring shelamim and the money becomes hullin. If the animal gave birth to a tumtum or a hermaphrodite, Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: no holiness attaches to them.","474":"If one says: \u201cThe offspring of this pregnant animal shall be an olah and it the animal itself shall be a shelamim,\u201d his words stand. But if he says first: \u201cIt the animal shall be a shelamim\u201d and then, \u201cand its offspring shall be an olah,\u201d its offspring is regarded as the offspring of an shelamim, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says: if he intended to say this at first, since it is impossible to mention both kinds of sacrifices simultaneously, his words stand; but if after he already said intentionally: this shall be a shelamim, and then he changed his mind and says: its offspring shall be an olah, its offspring is regarded as the offspring of a shelamim.","475":"If one says: \u201cBehold, this animal shall be the substitute of an olah and the substitute of a shelamim,\u201d it is the substitute of an olah, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says: if he originally intended this, since it is impossible to mention both names of sacrifices simultaneously, his words stand. But if after he had already said: \u201cThis shall be the substitute of an olah,\u201d he changed his mind and then said: \u201cThe substitute of a shelamim,\u201d it is the substitute of an olah.","476":"If one says: \u201cBehold this animal is tahat instead of this,\u201d or \u201cBehold this is temurat a substitute this,\u201d or \u201cBehold this is halufat in place of this,\u201d each of these is a substitute. If however one says: \u201cThis shall be redeemed for this,\u201d it is not the case of a valid substitute. And if the dedicated animal was blemished, it becomes hullin and he is required to make up the hullin to the value of the dedicated animal.","477":"If one says: \u201cBehold this animal shall be instead of a hatat,\u201d or \u201cinstead of an olah,\u201d he has said nothing. But if he says: \u201cInstead of this hatat\u201d or \u201cInstead of this olah,\u201d or \u201cInstead of the hatat or the olah which I have in the house,\u201d and he had it in the house, his words stand. If he says concerning an unclean animal or a blemished animal: \u201cBehold these shall be an olah,\u201d he has said nothing. But if he says: \u201cBehold they shall be for an olah,\u201d they are sold and he brings with their money an olah.","478":"All animals forbidden for the altar render others unfit however few there are. These are the animals forbidden for the altar: An animal which had sexual relations with a woman or an animal that had sexual relations with a man, an animal set aside for idolatry, or that had been worshipped as an idol; or that was the fee of a whore, or a dog's exchange; or that was kilayim; or terefah; or an animal born through a caesarean section,What is meant by muktzeh? That which has been set aside for idolatrous use. It the animal itself is forbidden, but what is upon it, is permitted. And what is meant by ne'evad? That which has been used for idolatry. Both it the animal itself and that which is upon it, are forbidden. In both cases the animal may be eaten.","479":"What is meant by \u201ca prostitute\u2019s fee\u201d?If one says to a prostitute, \u201cTake this lamb as your fee,\u201d even if there are a hundred lambs, they are all forbidden for the altar. If one says to his fellow: Here is a lamb and have your female slave sleep with my servant, Rabbi Meir says: it the lamb is not regarded as a prostitute\u2019s fee. But the sages say: it is regarded as a prostitute\u2019s fee.","480":"What is meant by the \u201cprice of a dog\u201d?If one says to his fellow, here is this lamb instead of this dog. And similarly if two partners divided an estate and one took ten lambs and the other nine and a dog, all those taken in place of the dog are forbidden for the altar, but those taken with a dog are valid for the altar. An animal that is the fee of a dog and the price of a prostitute are permitted for the altar, since it says: \u201cFor both of these\u201d (Deuteronomy 23:19): both\u2019 but not four. Their offspring are permitted for the altar since it says: \u201cBoth of these\u201d implying they but not their offspring.","481":"If he gave her a prostitute money, it is permitted for use for the altar. But if he gave her wine, oil, flour and anything similar which is offered on the altar, it is forbidden for the altar. If he gave her dedicated animals they are permitted for the altar. If he gave her birds of hullin they are disqualified. For one might have reasoned as follows: if in the case of dedicated animals, where a blemish disqualifies them, the law of the prostitute\u2019s fee and price of a dog does not apply to them, in the case of birds, where a blemish does not disqualify, is it not all the more reason that the law of the prostitute\u2019s fee and the price of a dog should not apply? Scripture says, \u201cFor any vow,\u201d this includes a bird.","482":"With regard to any animals that are disqualified for the altar, their offspring are permitted for the altar. The offspring of a terefah: Rabbi Elazar says it may not be offered on the altar. But the sages say it may be offered. Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: a ritually clean animal which nursed from a terefah is disqualified from the altar. Any dedicated animal which became terefah one may not dedicate them, since we may not redeem dedicated animals in order to give them to dogs to eat.","483":"There are laws which apply to dedications for the altar which do not apply to dedications   for repairs of the Temple, and there are laws which apply to dedications for the repairs of the Temple which do not apply to dedications for the altar.Dedications for the altar effect a substitute; They are subject to the laws of piggul, remnant   and ritual uncleanness; Their offspring and milk are forbidden even after their redemption; If one kills them outside the Temple he is guilty; And wages are not paid from them to artisans, Which is not the case with dedications for temple repairs.","484":"There are laws which apply to dedications for the repairs of the Temple which don\u2019t apply to dedications to the altar.Unspecified dedications go to the repairs of the Temple. Dedication for the repairs of the temple can have an effect on all things, The law of sacrilege applies to things that grow from them. And there is no benefit to be derived from them for the priest.","485":"Both dedications for the altar and dedications for the repairs of the Temple may not be changed from one holiness to another. One may dedicate them with a value-dedication, and one may conscribe them. If they die, they are buried. Rabbi Shimon says: dedications for the repairs of the temple, if they died, they are redeemed.","486":"And the following are things which must be buried:A dedicated animal which had a miscarriage, the miscarriage must be buried. A dedicated animal which expelled a placenta, the placenta must be buried. An ox which was condemned to be stoned. The heifer whose neck was broken. The birds brought in connection with the purification of one with skin disease (metzora). The hair of a nazirite. The first-born of a donkey. A mixture of meat cooked in milk. And hullin which were slaughtered in the Temple court. Shimon says: hullin which were slaughtered in the Temple court must be burned. And similarly a wild animal killed in the Temple court is also burned.","487":"And the following are to be burned:Chametz on Pesah is burned; Unclean terumah; Orlah; Kilayim in the vineyard--that which it is customary to burn is to be burned and that which it is customary to bury is to be buried. We may kindle with the bread and oil of unclean terumah.","488":"All dedicated animals which were slaughtered with the intention of being eaten after their set time or outside of their set place must be burned. An asham offered by one in doubt as to whether he has transgressed is to be burned. Rabbi Judah says: it is to be buried. A hatat of a bird that is brought for a doubt is burned. Rabbi Judah says: it is cast into the sewer. All things which must be buried must not be burned, and all things which must be burned must not be buried. Rabbi Judah says: if one wishes to be stringent with himself, to burn things which are buried, he is permitted to do so. They said to him: he is not allowed to change.","489":"All sacrifices slaughtered not in their own name are valid, except that they do not count in fulfilling their owners\u2019 obligation, with the exception of the pesah and the hatat (sin-offering). This is true for a pesah in its proper time and a hatat at all times. Rabbi Eliezer says: also the asham (guilt-offering). This is true for a pesah in its proper time and a hatat and an asham at all times. Rabbi Eliezer said: the hatat comes on account of sin, and the asham comes on account of sin: just as a hatat slaughtered not in its own name is invalid, so the asham is invalid if slaughtered not in its own name.","490":"Yose ben Honi says: Sacrifices slaughtered in the name of a pesah or a hatat are invalid. Shimon the brother of Azariah says: if one slaughtered them under a higher designation than their own they are valid; under a lower designation than their own, they are invalid. How so? If one slaughtered most sacred sacrifices under the designation of lesser sacrifices, they are invalid; but if one slaughtered lesser sacrifices under the designation of most sacred sacrifices, they are valid. If one slaughtered a bekhor or a tithe in the name of a shelamim, it is valid, but if one slaughtered a shelamim in the name of a bekhor or tithe, it is invalid.","491":"A pesah that was slaughtered on the morning of the fourteenth of Nisan under a different designation: Rabbi Joshua declares it valid, just as if it had been slaughtered on the thirteenth. Ben Batera declares it invalid, as if it had been slaughtered in the afternoon. Said Shimon ben Azzai: I have a tradition from seventy-two elders on the day that Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was placed in the academy, that all sacrifices which are eaten, though slaughtered under a different designation are valid, except that their owners have not fulfilled their obligation, except the pesah and the hatat. And ben Azzai added only the olah, but the sages did not agree with him.","492":"A pesah and a hatat which were slaughtered not in their own name, or he received the blood, and carried it to the altar and sprinkled it not in their own name, Or in their own name and not in their own name, or not in their own name and in their own name, they are disqualified. What is the case of \u2018in their own name and not in their own name\u2019? In the name of it being a pesah first and then in the name of it being a shelamim. \u2018Not in their own name and in their own name:\u2019 in the name of a shelamim first and then in the name of a pesah. For a sacrifice can be disqualified in any one of the four elements: slaughtering, receiving, carrying and sprinkling. Rabbi Shimon declares it valid if carried with the wrong intent, for Rabbi Shimon said: it is impossible to have a valid sacrifice without slaughtering, without receiving and without sprinkling, but it is possible without carrying. How so? One slaughters it at the side of the altar and sprinkles. Rabbi Elazar says: if one goes where he needs to go, an illegitimate intention disqualifies it; where he doesn\u2019t need to go, an illegitimate intention does not disqualify it.","493":"All sacrifices whose blood was caught by a: non-priest, an onen, a tebul yom, one lacking priestly vestments, one lacking sacrificial atonement, one who had not washed his hands and feet, an uncircumcised priest; an unclean priest; one who was sitting, one who was standing on utensils or on an animal or on another\u2019s feet, are disqualified. If the priest caught the blood with his left hand, it is disqualified. Rabbi Shimon declares it valid. If the blood was poured out on to the pavement and the priest collected it, it is disqualified. If the priest put it the blood on the ramp to the altar, or on the altar, but not against its base; if he applied the blood which should be applied below the scarlet line above it or that which should be applied above, below, or that which should be applied within he applied without, or that which should be applied without he applied within, it is invalid, but does not involve karet.","494":"One who slaughters a sacrifice intending: To sprinkle its blood outside the Temple or part of its blood outside; To burn its innards or part of its innards outside; To eat its flesh or as much as an olive of its flesh outside, Or to eat as much as an olive of the skin of the fat-tail outside, It is invalid, but it does not involve karet. One he slaughters a sacrifice intending: To sprinkle its blood or part of its blood the next day, To burn its innards or part of its innards on the next day; To eat its flesh or as much as an olive of its flesh on the next day; Or to eat as much as an olive of the skin of its fat-tail on the next day, It is piggul, and involves kareth.","495":"This is the general rule: anyone who slaughters or receives the blood, or carries it or sprinkles it intending to eat as much as an olive of that which is normally eaten or to burn on the altar as much as an olive of that which is normally burned outside its prescribed place, the sacrifice is invalid, but it does not involve karet; Intending to eat or burn after its designated time, it is piggul and it involves karet. Provided that the mattir is offered in accordance with the law.","496":"How is the mattir offered in accordance with the law? If one slaughtered in silence, and received, or carried, or sprinkled, intending to eat the sacrifice after its designated time; Or if one slaughtered intending to eat after its designated time, and received, and carried and sprinkled in silence, or if one slaughtered, or received, or carried, or sprinkled intending to eat after its designated time. That is offering the mattir in accordance with the law. How is the mattir not offered in accordance with the law? If one slaughtered intending to eat outside the designated place, and received, carried, and sprinkled with the intention of eating after its designated time; Or if one slaughtered intending to eat after its designated time, and received, carried, and sprinkled intending to eat outside its designated place, or if one slaughtered, received, carried, and sprinkled intending to eat outside its designated time. If one slaughtered the pesah or the hatat for the sake of something else, and received, carried, and sprinkled intending to eat them after their designated time; Or if one slaughtered them, intending to eat them after their designated time, and received, carried, and sprinkled for the sake of something else, or if one slaughtered, received, carried, and sprinkled for the sake of something else; In these cases the mattir was not offered in accordance with the law.","497":"If one intended to eat as much as an olive on the next day and as much as an olive on the outside its intended place, or as much as an olive outside its designated place and as much as an olive on the next day; Half as much as an olive on the next day and half as much as an olive outside its designated place; Half as much as an olive on the next day and half as much as an olive outside its designated place, The sacrifice is unfit, and does not involve karet. Rabbi Judah said: this is the general rule: where the improper intention of time precedes the improper intention of place, the sacrifice is piggul, and involves karet; but if the improper intention of place precedes the improper intention of time, it is invalid and does not involve kareth. But the sages say: in both cases the sacrifice is invalid and does not involve karet. If one intends to eat half as much as an olive after its intended time or outside its intended place and to burn half as much as an olive similarly it is valid, for eating and burning do not combine.","498":"All unfit persons who slaughtered, their slaughtering is valid, for slaughtering is valid even when performed by non-priests, and by women, and by slaves, and by the unclean, even in the case of most-holy sacrifices, provided that unclean persons do not touch the flesh. Therefore they invalidate the sacrifice by an illegitimate intention. And in all of these cases, if they received the blood in order to eat the sacrifice after the prescribed time, or outside of the prescribed place, if there remains in the animal life-blood, a fit person should go back and receive the blood.","499":"If a fit person received the blood and gave it to an unfit person, he must return it to the fit one. If he received the blood in his right hand and transferred it to his left, he must return it to his right. If he received it in a sacred vessel and poured it into a secular non-sacred vessel, he must return it to the sacred vessel. If he spilled it from the vessel on to the pavement and then collected it, it is fit. If the priest applied it on the ascent or on the altar, but not against the altar\u2019s base; or if he applied what should be applied below the scarlet line above it, or what should be applied above, below; or what should be applied within he applied without, or what should be applied without, within1 and life-blood is still available, a fit priest must receive blood anew.","500":"If one slaughters the sacrifice intending to eat what is not normally eaten, or to burn on the altar what is not normally burned outside of the time or place the sacrifice must be eaten or burned, it is valid; But Rabbi Eliezer invalidates the sacrifice. If he slaughters it intending to eat what is normally eaten and to burn what is normally burned outside of the time or place the sacrifice must be eaten or burned, but less than the size of an olive, it is valid. To eat half as much as an olive and to burn half as much as an olive outside of the time or place the sacrifice must be eaten or burned, it is valid, because intentions concerning eating and burning do not combine.","501":"One who slaughters the sacrifice intending to eat as much as an olive of the skin, or of the juice, or of the jelly, or of the hardened meat, or of the bones, or of the tendons, or of the horns, or of the hoofs, either after time or out of bounds, it is valid, and one is not liable on their account in respect of piggul, remnant, or uncleanness.","502":"If one slaughters sacred animals intending to eat the fetus or the afterbirth outside of the place or time where the animal must be eaten, he does not render it piggul. If one plucks off the necks of doves, intending to eat their eggs outside of the place or time where the animal must be eaten, he does not render them piggul. The milk of sacred animals or the eggs of doves one is not liable for eating them in respect of piggul, remnant, or uncleanness.","503":"If he slaughtered it with the intention of leaving its blood or its innards for the next day, or of carrying them outside of their place: Rabbi Judah disqualifies it, But the sages declare it valid. If he slaughtered it with the intention of sprinkling the blood on the ascent, or on the altar but not against its base; or of applying below the scarlet line what should be applied above, or above what should be applied below, or without what should be applied within, or within what should be applied without; Or with the intention that unclean persons should eat it, or that unclean priests should offer it; Or that uncircumcised persons should eat it, or that uncircumcised persons should offer it; Or with the intention of breaking the bones of the pesah, or eating of it before it is roasted; Or of mingling its blood with the blood of invalid sacrifices; In all of these cases it is valid, because an illegitimate intention does not disqualify a sacrifice except when it refers to after its time or outside its prescribed place, and in the case of a pesah and a hatat, the intention to slaughter them for the sake of their being a different sacrifice.","504":"Bet Shammai says: any blood which is to be sprinkled on the outer altar, if the priest applied it with one sprinkling, he has made atonement, and in the case of a hatat two applications, but Bet Hillel says: also the case of the hatat if the priest applied it with one sprinkling it atones Therefore if he made the first application in the proper manner and the second with the intention to eat the flesh after the prescribed time, it atones. If he made the first application with the intention to eat the flesh after the prescribed time and the second outside the prescribed place, it is piggul and involves the punishment of karet.","505":"With regard to any blood which is sprinkled on the inner altar, if the priest omitted one of the applications, he has not atoned; therefore if he applied all in the proper manner but one in an improper manner, it the sacrifice is invalid, but does not involve karet.","506":"These are the things for which one is not liable on account of piggul:The fistful, The incense, The frankincense, The priests\u2019 meal-offering, The anointed priest's meal-offering, The minhah with libation The blood, The libations that are brought separately, the words of Rabbi Meir. The sages say: also those that are brought with an animal sacrifice. The log  of oil brought by the metzora: Rabbi Shimon says: one is not liable on account of piggul; But Rabbi Meir says: one is liable on account of piggul, because the blood of the asham makes it permitted and whatever has something else that makes it permitted,  whether for man or for the altar, one is liable on its account for piggul.","507":"The sprinkling of the blood of the olah permits its flesh for burning on the altar, and its skin to the priests. The sprinkling of the blood of the olah of a bird permits its flesh to the altar. The sprinkling of the blood of the hatat of a bird permits its flesh to the priests. The sprinkling of the blood of the bullocks that are burned and the goats that are burned permits their innards to be offered on the altar. Rabbi Shimon said: whatever is not sprinkled on the outer altar, as in the case of shelamim, one is not liable for it on account of piggul.","508":"The sacrifices of non-Jews: one is not liable on their account for piggul, remnant, or defilement, and if a priest slaughters them outside the Temple, he is not liable, the words of Rabbi Meir. But Rabbi Yose declares him liable. The things for which one is not liable on account of piggul, one is liable on account of remnant and defilement except blood. Rabbi Shimon declares one liable for anything which is normally eaten, but for wood, frankincense and incense, one is not liable for transgressions involving defilement.","509":"The sacrifice is slaughtered for the sake of six things:For the sake of the sacrifice, For the sake of the sacrificer, For the sake of the Divine Name, For the sake of fire-offerings, For the sake of fragrance, For the sake of pleasing; And a hatat and an asham for the sake of sin. Rabbi Yose said: even if one did not have any of these purposes in his heart, it is valid, because it is a regulation of the court. Since the intention is determined only by the worshipper.","510":"Which is the place for the offering of the sacrifices?Most holy sacrifices are slaughtered on the north side of the altar. The bullock and the goat of Yom Kippur are done at the north, and the receiving of their blood is performed with ministering vessels at the north, and their blood requires sprinkling between the poles of the ark, on the curtain, and on the golden altar. The omission of a single application of the blood invalidates them. He the priest would pour out the remainders of the blood on the western base of the outer altar, but if he did not pour it out, he did not invalidate the sacrifice.","511":"As for the bullocks which were burnt and the goats which were burnt, their slaughtering is done at the north, and the reception of their blood is done at the north, and their blood requires sprinkling on the veil, and on the golden altar; The omission of a single one of these applications invalidates the sacrifice. He the priest pours the remainder of the blood on the western base of the altar; but if he did not pour it out, he did not invalidate the sacrifice. Both of these were burnt at the ash pit.","512":"Concerning public and private hatats: They are slaughtered in the north, and their blood is received in ministering vessels in the north, and their blood requires four applications on the four corners of the altar. How was it done? He went up the ascent, turned to the surrounding walkway, and came to the south-east corner, then the north-east, then the north-west, and then the south-west. He would pour the residue of the blood out at the southern base. They were eaten within the hangings of the Tabernacle, by male priests, prepared in any fashion, the same day and night, until midnight.","513":"The olah is a most holy sacrifice. It is slaughtered in the north, and its blood is received in a ministering vessel in the north; and its blood requires two applications, which are four. It had to be flayed, dismembered, and completely consumed by the fire.","514":"The shelamim of the public and the ashams: These are thedifferent types of ashams: The asham for robbery; The asham or illegal use of holy property; The asham for a betrothed maidservant; A nazirite's asham; A leper's asham; And the suspended asham. These are slaughtered in the north, and their blood is received in a service vessel in the north, and their blood requires two sprinklings, which constitute four. And they are eaten within the curtains of the Tabernacle, by male priests, prepared in any manner, the same day and night, until midnight.","515":"The todah and the nazirite's ram are sacrifices of lesser sanctity. They are slaughtered anywhere in the Temple Court, and their blood requires two sprinklings, which constitute four; And they are eaten in any part of the city, by any person, prepared in any manner, the same day and the night following, until midnight. The parts of them which are raised are governed by the same law, save that these are eaten only by the priests, their wives, their children and their slaves.","516":"The shelamim is a sacrifice of lesser sanctity. It may be slaughtered in any part of the Temple court, and its blood requires two sprinklings, which constitute four.

The parts of them which are raised are governed by the same law, save that these are eaten only by the priests, their wives, their children and their slaves.","517":"The first-born animal, tithe and the pesah are sacrifices of lesser sanctity. They are slaughtered in any part of the Temple court, and their blood requires one sprinkling, provided that he applies it against the base of the altar. They differ in the rules governing their eating: The first-born animal is eaten by priests only, the tithe is eaten by anyone and they can be eaten in any part of the city, prepared in any manner, during two days and one night. The pesah can be eaten only at night, only until midnight, and it can be eaten only by those registered for it, and it can be eaten only when roasted.","518":"Most holy sacrifices which were slaughtered on the top of the altar: Rabbi Yose says: it is as though they were slaughtered in the north. Rabbi Yose son of Rabb Judah says: from the middle of the altar southward is as south, from the middle of the altar northward is as the north. The fistfuls of meal-offerings were taken in any part of the Temple court, and they the minhah-offerings were eaten within the curtains, by male priests, prepared in any manner, on the same day and night, until midnight.","519":"The hatat of a bird was sacrificed by the southwest horn of the altar. It is valid if done in any place, but this was its particular place. That horn served for three things below, and three things above: Below: for the hatat of the bird, For the presenting of meal-offerings. And for the residue of the blood. Above: for the pouring out of wine and water, and for the olah of a bird when there was too much on the east.","520":"All who ascended the altar, ascended by the right, then they went round the altar and descended by the left, except for these three, who ascended and descended by retracing their steps.","521":"How was the hatat of a bird sacrificed?He pinches off its head behind its neck, but he did not sever it. And he would sprinkle its blood on the wall of the altar. The residue of the blood was drained out on the base. Only the blood belonged to the altar, while the rest of it belonged to the priests.","522":"How was the olah of a bird sacrificed? He the priest ascended the ramp, and turned to the surrounding walkway, and made his way to the southeast horn. There he pinched its head at the back of the neck, and severed it, and drained out its blood on the wall of the altar. He took the head, turned the part where it was nipped to the altar, saturated it with salt, and threw it on to the fires of the altar. Then he came to the body, and removed the crop, the feathers, and the entrails that came out of it, and threw them on to the burning place.

A hatat of a bird or an olah of a bird which he nipped, or drained out the blood with the intention to eat what was normally eaten or to burn what was normally burned outside of the appropriate place, is invalid, but it does not involve karet; After the appropriate time, it is piggul and involves karet, Provided that the mattir was offered in accordance with the regulations. How does he offer the mattir according to regulations? If he nipped it in silence and drained the blood with an intention of after the appropriate time; or if he nipped it with an intention of after the appropriate time and drained the blood in silence; or if he nipped it and drained the blood with an intention of after the appropriate time: in these cases he offered the mattir according to regulation.

But Rabbi Joshua says: it does not involve trespass.

Rabbi Joshua said to him: No, when you speak of a hatat whose name he changed to that of an olah, it involves trespass because he changed its name to something that involves trespass; will you say the same of an olah whose name he changed to that of a hatat, seeing that he changed its name to something which does not involve trespass? Rabbi Eliezer said to him: Behold, most holy sacrifices which he slaughtered in the south and which he slaughtered in the name of lesser sacrifices will prove the matter, for he changed their name to something which does not involve trespass, and yet they involve trespass, so too, do not be surprised that in the case of the olah, although he changed its name to something that does not involve trespass, it still involves trespass. Rabbi Joshua said: No, when you speak of most holy sacrifices which are slaughtered in the south and in the name of lesser sacrifices, they involve trespass because he changed their name to something which is partly forbidden and partly permitted; will you say the same of an olah, where he changed its name to something that is altogether permitted?","529":"If he nipped the bird sacrifice with his left hand or at night; if he slaughtered hullin within the Temple courtyard or a sacrifice outside the Temple courtyard they do not defile in the gullet.

This is the general rule: all whose unfitness arose in sanctity do not defile in the gullet; if their unfitness did not arise in sanctity, they defile in the gullet.

Now, just as we have found that slaughtering, which makes it a bird of hullin fit for eating, cleanses its terefah from its uncleanness; so melikah (nipping), which makes it a bird sacrifice fit for eating, cleanses its terefah. Rabbi Yose says: it is sufficient for it to be like the nevelah of a beast, which is cleansed by slaughtering, but not by melikah (nipping).","531":"All sacrifices which became mixed up with hatats that must be left to die, or with an ox that is to be stoned, even one in ten thousand, all must be left to die. If they were mixed up with: an ox with which a transgression had been committed for instance: one that had killed a man on the testimony of one witness or of its owner; or an ox that had sexual relations with a woman or one with whom a man had sexual relations; or an animal set aside for idolatry, or that had been worshipped as an idol; or that was the fee of a whore, or a dog's exchange; or that was kilayim; or terefah; or an animal born through the caesarean section, In all of these cases they must graze until they become defected, then they are sold, and one brings a sacrifice of the same kind at the price of the better of them. If they were mixed up with unblemished animals of hullin, the hullin must be sold to those who need that kind for a sacrifice.","532":"A sacrifice which was mixed up with another sacrifice, both being of the same kind: this one is offered in the name of whoever is its owner, and the other is offered in the name of whoever is its owner. A sacrifice which was mixed up with a sacrifice, both being of different kinds: they must graze until they become unfit, and then he purchases at the price of the better of them an animal of each kind, and he pays the loss of the excess out of his own pocket. If they were mixed up with a firstling or tithe, they must graze until they become unfit, and then they are eaten as firstling or tithe. All sacrifices can be mixed up, except the hatat and the asham.","533":"An asham which was mixed up with a shelamim: They graze until they become unfit. Rabbi Shimon says: they are slaughtered at the north side of the altar and eaten in accordance with the laws of the more stringent of them. They said to him: one must not bring sacrifices to a place of unfitness. If pieces of sacrificial flesh were mixed up with pieces of other sacrificial flesh, most sacred sacrifices with lesser sacrifices, pieces that are eaten one day with those that are eaten two days and one night, they must be eaten in accordance with the laws of the more stringent of them.","534":"Limbs of a hatat which were mixed up with limbs from an olah: Rabbi Eliezer says: he must place them all on the top of the altar, and regard the flesh of the hatat on top as though it were wood. But the sages say: they must become disfigured, and then go out to the place of burning.","535":"Limbs of unblemished olahs which were mixed up with the limbs of blemished olahs: Rabbi Eliezer says: if the priest offered the head of one of them, all the heads are to be offered; the legs of one of them, all the legs are to be offered. But the sages say: even if they had offered all except one of them, it goes forth to the place of burning.","536":"If blood was mixed with water, if it retains the appearance of blood, it is fit to be sprinkled on the altar. If it was mixed with wine, we regard it as though it were water. If it was mixed with the blood of a beast or wild animal, we regard it as though it were water. Rabbi Judah said: blood cannot nullify blood.","537":"If it was mixed with the blood of unfit animals, it must be poured out into the duct. If it was mixed with the blood that came out after death, it must be poured out into the duct. Rabbi Eliezer declares it fit. If he the priest did not ask but sprinkled it, it is valid.","538":"If blood of unblemished animals was mixed with blood of blemished animals, it must be poured out into the duct. If a goblet of valid blood was mixed up with other goblets of invalid blood: Rabbi Eliezer said: if he the priest offered sprinkled one goblet, all the goblets can be offered; But the sages say: even if they offered all of them save one, it must be poured out into the duct.","539":"If blood that is to be sprinkled below the red line on the altar was mixed with blood that is sprinkled above: Rabbi Eliezer says: he must sprinkle it above, and I regard the lower blood which was sprinkled above as though it were water, and then he sprinkles again below. But the sages say: he must pour it out into the duct. If he the priest did not ask but sprinkled it, it is valid.","540":"If blood which requires one application was mixed with blood also requiring one application, it the mixture should be presented with one application. If blood which requires four applications was mixed with blood requiring four applications, they should be presented with four applications. If blood which requires four applications was mixed with blood which requires one application: Rabbi Eliezer says: it the mixture should be presented with four applications. Rabbi Joshua says: it should be presented with one application. Rabbi Eliezer said to him: Behold, he transgresses the injunction not to diminish from God\u2019s commandment! Rabbi Joshua said to him: Behold, he transgresses the injunction not to add to God\u2019s commandments. Rabbi Eliezer said to him: The injunction not to add applies only where it is by itself. Rabbi Joshua said to him: The injunction not to diminish applies only where it is by itself. Moreover, Rabbi Joshua said: when you make four applications you transgress the injunction not to add, and perform an action with your own hands; whereas when you do not make four applications you transgress the injunction not to diminish, but do not perform an action with your own hands.","541":"If blood which is to be sprinkled inside the Sanctuary was mixed with blood that is to be sprinkled outside, it must be poured out into the duct. If the priest sprinkled outside and then sprinkled inside, it is valid. If he sprinkled inside and then went back and sprinkled outside: Rabbi Akiva declares it unfit, But the sages declare it fit. For Rabbi Akiva says: all blood which entered the Sanctuary to make atonement is unfit; But the sages say: the hatat alone is unfit. R. Eliezer said: the asham too, for it says, \u201cAs is the hatat, so is the asham\u201d (Leviticus 7:7).","542":"If the blood of a hatat was received in two goblets and one of them went outside the Temple courtyard, the inside one is fit. If one of them entered within the Sanctuary: Rabbi Yose the Galilean declares the outer one fit. The sages disqualify it. Rabbi Yose the Galilean: if the place where an intention directed to it disqualifies, i.e. without, you do not treat what is left inside as what went out; then the place where an intention directed to it does not disqualify, i.e. within, is it not logical that we do not treat what is left outside as what entered within? If it entered within to make atonement, even if he the priest did not make atonement, it is unfit, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Shimon said: it is not unfit unless he makes atonement. Rabbi Judah said: if he took it in unwittingly, it is fit. For all unfit blood which was put on the altar, the head plate of the high priest does not propitiate, save for the unclean, for the headplate propitiates for that which is unclean, but does not propitiate for what goes out.","543":"The altar sanctifies whatever is eligible for it. Rabbi Joshua says: whatever is eligible for the altar fire does not descend once it has ascended, as it is said, \u201cThe olah itself shall remain where it is burned upon the altar all night until morning, while the fire of the altar is kept going on it\u201d (Leviticus 6:: just as the olah, which is eligible for the altar fire, does not descend once it has ascended, so whatever is eligible for the altar fire does not descend once it ascended. Rabbi Gamaliel said: whatever is eligible for the altar does not descend once it ascended, as it is said: \u201cThe olah itself shall remain where it is burned upon the altar all night until morning, while the fire of the altar is kept going on it\u201d (Leviticus 6:2): just as the olah, which is eligible for the altar, does not descend once it ascended, so whatever is eligible for the altar does not descend once it ascended. The only difference between Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Joshua is in respect of the blood and libations, for Rabban Gamaliel says that they cannot descend, while Rabbi Joshua says that they can descend. Rabbi  Shimon says: if the sacrifice is fit while the libations which accompanied it are unfit; or if the libations are fit while the sacrifice is unfit; or even if both are unfit,   the sacrifice does not descend, while the libations do descend.","544":"The following do not descend once they have ascended: Sacrificial flesh that was kept overnight, Or that which becomes unclean Or that that which goes out of its permitted boundaries, Or which was slaughtered with the intention of consuming it after the appropriate time or outside the appropriate place; Or if unfit persons received and sprinkled its blood. Rabbi Judah says: that which was slaughtered at night or whose blood was spilt or whose blood went outside the curtains, if it ascended, it must descend. Rabbi Shimon says: it does not descend, because Rabbi Shimon says: anything whose disqualification arose in sanctity, the sacred altar receives it; if its disqualification did not arise in sanctity, the sacred altar does not receive it.","545":"Which are the ones whose disqualification did not arise in sanctity: An animal which had sexual relations with a woman or with a man, or that was the fee of a whore, or a dog's exchange; or that was kilayim; or terefah; or an animal born through the caesarean section, and blemished animals. Rabbi Akiva declared blemished animals fit to remain on the altar if they had already been put up. Rabbi Hananya, chief of the priests, said: my father used to push blemished animals off the altar.","546":"Just as they do not descend once they have ascended, so they do not ascend if they have descended. And all of these, if they ascended alive to the top of the altar, they must descend. An olah which ascended live to the top of the altar, it must descend. If one slaughtered it on the top of the altar, he must skin it and dismember it where it lies.","547":"The following if they ascended are taken down:The flesh of most sacred sacrifices The flesh of lesser sacrifices; The remnants of the omer; The two loaves; The showbread; The remnants of meal-offerings; And the incense. The wool on the heads of lambs, the hair of he-goats\u2019 beards, the bones, tendons, horns and hoofs if they are attached, go up, because it is said, \u201cAnd the priest shall turn it all into smoke on the altar\u201d (Leviticus 1:9). If they were severed from the animal, they do not go up, for it is said, \u201cAnd You shall offer your olah, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the Lord your God\u201d (Deuteronomy 12:27).","548":"And if any of these sprang off from the altar they are not replaced. Similarly, if a coal sprang off from the altar, it is not replaced. Limbs that sprang off from the altar: if before midnight, must be replaced, and they involve trespass; after midnight, they are not replaced and do not involve trespass.","549":"Just as the altar sanctifies whatever is eligible for it, so does the ascent sanctify whatever is eligible for it; And just as the altar and the ascent sanctify whatever is eligible for them, so do vessels sanctify. Vessels for liquids sanctify liquids, And the measures sanctify dry material. A liquid vessel does not sanctify dry matter, nor does a dry measure sanctify a liquid. If holy vessels were perforated and they can be used for the same purpose as when whole, they sanctify what is placed in them; if not, they do not sanctify. And all these sanctify only in the holy place.","550":"Whatever is more frequent than another, takes precedence over the other. The daily offerings precede the additional offerings; The additional offerings of Shabbat precede the additional offerings of Rosh Hodesh; The additional offerings of Rosh Hodesh precede the additional offerings of Rosh Hashanah. As it is said, \u201cYou shall present these in addition to the morning portion of the regular burnt offering\u201d (Numbers 28:23).","551":"Whatever is more sacred than another precedes the other. The blood of a hatat precedes the blood of a olah, because it propitiates. The limbs of a olah precede the innards of a hatat, because it the former is entirely for the fires of the altar. A hatat precedes an asham, because its blood is sprinkled on the four horns and on the base. An asham precedes a today and a nazirite\u2019s ram, because it is a most holy sacrifice. A todah and a nazirite's ram precede a shelamim, because they are eaten one day only and require the accompaniment of loaves. A shelamim precedes a firstling, because it requires four blood applications and laying of hands, libations, and the waving of the breast and the thigh.","552":"A first-born precedes tithe, because its sanctity is from the womb, and it is eaten by priests. Tithe precedes bird -offerings because it is a slaughtered sacrifice, and part of it is most sacred: its blood and innards.","553":"Birds precede meal-offerings (minhah), because they are blood sacrifices. A sinner\u2019s meal-offering precedes a voluntary meal-offering, because it comes on account of sin. A hatat of a bird precedes an olah of a bird. And it is likewise when he dedicates them.","554":"All hatats in the Torah precede ashams, except the asham of a metzora (one with a skin affliction), because it comes to make a person fit. All ashams of the Torah must be two-year olds and two silver shekels in value, except a nazirite\u2019s asham and the asham of a metzorah, for they are a year old, and need not be two silver shekels in value.","555":"Just as they take precedence in being offered, so they take precedence in being eaten. Yesterday\u2019s shelamim and today\u2019s shelamim, yesterday\u2019s takes precedence. Yesterday\u2019s shelamim and today\u2019s hatat and asham, yesterday's shelamim takes precedence, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: the hatat takes precedence, because it is a most sacred sacrifice.","556":"And in all of these, the priests may deviate in how they eat, and eat them roasted, stewed or boiled. And one may season them with hullin spices or terumah spices, the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Meir says: one should not season them with terumah spices, so as not to bring terumah to unfitness.","557":"Rabbi Shimon said: if you see oil being divided in the Temple courtyard, you don\u2019t need to ask what it is for, for it is the remnant of oil of the wafers of the Israelite\u2019s meal-offerings, or of the metzora\u2019s log of oil. If you see oil being poured on to the fires, you don\u2019t need not ask what it is for, for it is the remnant of the oil of the wafers of priests\u2019 meal-offerings, or of the anointed priest's meal-offering; for one cannot voluntarily offer offer oil alone. Rabbi Tarfon say: oil can be voluntarily offered alone.","558":"If the blood of a hatat spurted on to a garment, it must be washed. Though scripture speaks only of hatats which are eaten, for it is said, \u201cIn the holy place shall it be eaten,\u201d (Leviticus 6:19), yet both those which may be eaten and the inner sacrifices necessitate washing, for it is said, \u201cThis is the law of the hatat\u201d (Leviticus 6:18), there is one law for all hatats.","559":"The blood of a disqualified hatat does not necessitate washing, whether it had a period of fitness or did not have a period of fitness. Which had a period of fitness? One whose blood was kept overnight, or was defiled, or was taken out of the Temple courtyard. Which did not have a period of fitness? One which was slaughtered with the intention of eating it after the appropriate time or outside the appropriate bounds; or whose blood was received by unfit persons, and sprinkled by them.","560":"If blood spurted direct from the animal's throat onto a garment, it does not require washing. From the horn or from the base of the altar, it does not require washing. If it spilled out on to the floor of the Temple and the priest collected it, and then it splattered onto a garment it does not require washing. Only blood which was received in a vessel and is fit for sprinkling requires washing. If the blood spurted on to the hide, before it was flayed, it does not require washing. If it spurted after it was flayed, it requires washing, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Elazar says: even if it spurted on the skin after it was flayed it does not require washing. Only the place of the blood requires washing. And whatever is eligible to contract uncleanness, And whatever is fit for washing.","561":"Whether a garment, a sack, or a hide, it requires washing in a holy place. The breaking of an earthen vessel must be in a holy place. And the scouring and rinsing of a copper vessel must be in a holy place. In this the hatat is more stringent than other sacrifices of higher sanctity.","562":"If a garment was carried outside the curtains of the Tabernacle, it must re-enter, and is washed it in the holy place. If it was defiled outside the curtains, one must tear it, then it re-enters, and is washed in the holy place. If an earthen vessel was carried outside the hangings, it re-enters and is broken in a holy place. If it was defiled outside the curtains, a hole is made in it, then it re-enters and is broken in a holy place.","563":"If a copper vessel was carried outside the hangings, it re-enters and is scoured and rinsed in a holy place. If it was defiled outside the hangings, it must be broken through, then it re-enters and is scoured and rinsed in a holy place.","564":"Whether one boiled in it or poured boiling sacrificial flesh into it, whether most sacred sacrifices or lesser sacrifices, the pot requires scouring and rinsing. Rabbi Shimon says: lesser sacrifices do not require scouring and rinsing. Rabbi Tarfon says: if one boiled sacrifices in a pot at the beginning of a festival, he can boil in it during the whole festival. But the sages say: until the time of eating, scouring and rinsing. Scouring is done as the scouring of a goblet; and rinsing is as the rinsing of a goblet, Scouring in hot water and rinsing in cold water. The spit and the grill are cleansed with hot water.","565":"If one boiled sacrifices and hullin in it the copper pot, or most holy sacrifices and lesser sacrifices, if they were sufficient to impart their flavor, the less stringent must be eaten as the more stringent of them; But they do not necessitate scouring and rinsing; And they do not disqualify by touch. If an unfit wafer touched a fit wafer, or an unfit piece of meat touched a fit piece of meat, not the whole wafer or the whole piece of meat is forbidden; only the part that absorbed of the unfit is forbidden.","566":"A tebul yom and one who lacks atonement do not share in sacrifices for consumption in the evening. An onen may handle sacrifices, but he may not offer them, and he does not receive a share for consumption in the evening. Priests with blemishes, whether permanent or passing, receive a share and may eat of the sacrifices but they may not offer them. Whoever is not eligible for service does not share in the flesh. And he who does not share in the flesh does not share in the hides. Even if one was unclean when the blood was sprinkled but clean when the fats were burned on the altar, he does not share in the flesh, for it is said: \u201che among the sons of Aaron, that offers the blood of the shelamim, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion\u201d (Leviticus 7:33).","567":"Whenever the altar does not acquire its flesh, the priests do not acquire the hide, for it is said, \u201cAnd the priest that offers any man\u2019s olah the priest shall have \u2026 the hide\u201d (Leviticus 7:8), this means, an olah which went up on the altar on behalf a man. If an olah was slaughtered under a different designation, although it does not count for its owner, its hide belongs to the priests. Whether it be a man\u2019s olah or a woman's olah, the hide belong to the priests.","568":"The hides of less holy sacrifices belong to their owners. The hides of most holy sacrifices belong to the priest. This is a kal vehomer: if with an olah, even though they do not acquire its flesh they do acquire its hide, is it not logical that they acquire the hides of most holy sacrifices, when they do acquire their flesh? The altar does not refute this argument, for it does not acquire the hide in any instance.","569":"All sacrifices which became disqualified, before they were flayed, their hides do not belong to the priests. After they were flayed, their hides belong to the priests. Rabbi Hanina vice-chief of the priests said: Never in my life have I seen a hide go out to the place of burning. Rabbi Akiva said: we learn from his words that if one flays a firstling and it is found to be terefah, the priests have a right to its hide. But the sages say: \u201cI have never seen\u201d is not proof: rather, it the hide must go forth to the place of burning.","570":"Bullocks which are burned and goats which are burned: when they are burned in fulfillment of their prescribed commandment, they are burned in the ash depository (bet hadeshen), and they defile garments. But when they are not burned in fulfillment of their commandment, they are burned in the bet habirah and they do not defile garments.","571":"They would carry them on staves out of the Temple courtyard. If those in front had passed outside the wall of the Temple courtyard, but those in the back had not yet gone out, those in front defile their garments, while those in the back do not defile their garments, until they go out. When they both go out, both defile their garments. Rabbi Shimon says: neither defile their garments until the fire is burning in the greater part of them. When the flesh is dissolved, he who burns it does not defile his garments.","572":"He who slaughters and offers up outside the Temple courtyard is liable in respect of slaughtering and in respect of offering. Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: if he slaughtered inside and offered up outside, he is liable; if he slaughtered outside and offered up outside, he is not liable for offering up, because he offered up only that which was unfit. They said to him: even when one slaughters inside and offers up outside, since he carries it out, he renders it unfit.","573":"An unclean person who eats of sacrifices, whether unclean sacrifices or clean sacrifices, is liable. Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: an unclean person who eats clean sacrifices is liable, but an unclean person who eats unclean sacrifices is not liable because he ate only that which is unclean. They said to him: even when an unclean person eats clean sacrifices, when he touches it, he defiles it. A clean person who eats unclean sacrifices is not liable, because one is liable only on account of bodily uncleanness.","574":"Slaughtering outside the Temple is more stringent than offering up outside, and offering up is more stringent than slaughtering. Slaughtering is more stringent, for he who slaughters a sacrifice to a man is liable, whereas he who offers up to a man is not liable. Offering up is more stringent: two who hold a knife and slaughter are not liable, whereas if two take hold of a limb and offer it up, they are liable. If one offered up, then offered up again, then offered up again, he is liable in respect of each act of offering up, the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yose says: he is liable for only one. He is liable only when he offers up on the top of an altar. Rabbi Shimon says: he is liable even if he offers up on the top of a rock or a stone.","575":"In regard to both valid sacrifices or invalid sacrifices which had become unfit within the Temple: if one offers them outside, he is liable. If one offers up outside the Temple as much as an olive\u2019s worth of an olah and its innards combined, he is liable. As for the fistful of flour, the frankincense, the incense, the priests\u2019 meal-offering, the anointed priest\u2019s meal-offering, and the meal offering of libations, if one offered up as much as an olive of one of these outside, he is liable. But Rabbi Elazar exempts him unless he offers up the whole of them. In all of these cases, if they offered them within, and left over an olive\u2019s worth and one offered it outside, he is liable. In all of these cases, if they became lacking something, and one offered them outside, he is not liable.","576":"One who offers sacrifices together with the innards outside the Temple, is liable. If a minhah had not had its fistful removed and one offered it outside, he is exempt. If one took out the fistful, and then the fistful went back into the minhah, and he offered it outside, he is liable.","577":"As for the fistful and the frankincense, if one offered one of them without the other outside the Temple, he is liable. Rabbi Elazar says: he is exempt unless he offers the second too. If one offered one inside and the other outside, he is liable. As for the two dishes of frankincense, if one offered one of them outside, he is liable. Rabbi Elazar says: he is exempt unless he offers the second too. If one offered one inside and the other outside, he is liable. If one sprinkles part of the blood outside, he is liable. Rabbi Elazar says: also one who makes a libation of the water of the Festival of  Sukkot on the festival, outside is liable. Rabbi Nehemiah says: if one offered the residue of the blood outside, he is liable.","578":"If one nips a bird offering inside and offers it up outside, he is liable; If one nips it outside and offers it up outside, he is exempt. If one slaughters a bird inside and offers it up outside, he is exempt. If one slaughters it outside and offers it up outside, he is liable. Thus its prescribed rite inside exempts him if he does it outside, while its prescribed rite outside exempts him if he does it inside. Rabbi Shimon says: whatever he is liable for outside, he is liable in similar circumstances inside when one subsequently offers it up outside; except when one slaughters a bird inside and offers it up outside.","579":"As for a hatat whose blood was received in one goblet: If one first sprinkled the blood outside and then sprinkled it inside; Or inside and then outside, he is liable, because the whole of it was eligible inside. If the blood was received in two goblets: If he sprinkled both inside, he is exempt; Both outside, he is liable. One inside and one outside, he is exempt; One outside and one inside, he is liable on account of the one outside, while the one inside makes atonement. To what may this be compared? To one who set aside an animal for a hatat, then it was lost, and he set aside another in its place; then the first was found, and so both are present. If he slaughtered both of them inside, he is exempt; Both of them outside, he is liable. If he slaughtered one inside and one outside, he is exempt; One outside and one inside, he is liable on account of the one outside, while the one inside makes atonement. Just as the blood exempts its own flesh, so does it exempt the flesh of its companion the other animal.","580":"If one slaughtered the hatat cow the red heifer outside its appointed place, and likewise if one offered the scapegoat of Yom Kippur outside, he is not liable, because it says, \u201cAnd has not brought it unto the door of the Tent of Meeting,\u201d (Leviticus 17:4): whatever is not eligible to come to the door of the Tent of Meeting, one is not liable on its account.","581":"As for an ox that had sexual relations with a woman or one with whom a man had sexual relations; or an animal set aside for idolatry, or that had been worshipped as an idol; or that was the fee of a whore, or a dog's exchange; or that was kilayim; or a terefah; or an animal born through caesarean section, if one offered any of these outside, he is not liable, because it says, \u201cBefore the Tabernacle of the Lord\u201d (Leviticus 17:4): whatever is not eligible to come before the Tabernacle of the Lord, one is not liable on its account. As for blemished animals, whether with permanent blemishes or with passing blemishes, if one offers them outside, he is exempt. Rabbi Shimon says: if one offers animals with permanent blemishes, he is exempt; if one offers animals with passing blemishes, he violates a negative commandment. As for turtledoves before their time and young pigeons after their time, if one offered them outside, he is exempt. Rabbi Shimon says: if one offers young pigeons after their time, he is exempt; turtledoves before their time, he violates a negative commandment. One who offers an animal together with its young on the same day, and one who offers an animal before its time, is not liable. Rabbi Shimon says: he violates a negative commandment. For Rabbi Shimon would say: whatever is eligible to come onto the altar later entails a negative commandment, but does not entail karet. But the sages say: whatever does not entail karet also does not entail a negative commandment.","582":"\u201cBefore time\u201d applies both to the animal itself and to its owner. What is \u201cbefore time\u201d as applied to its owner? If a zav or a zavah, a woman after childbirth, or a metzora, offered their hatat or their asham outside before the time in which they were obligated, they are exempt; If they offered their olah or their shelamims outside before their time, they are liable. One who offers up flesh of a hatat, or flesh of an asham, or flesh of most holy sacrifices, or flesh of less holy sacrifices; or the remainder of the omer, or the two loaves, or the showbread, or the remainder of meal-offerings; Or if he pours the oil on to the meal-offering, or mingles it with flour, or breaks up the meal-offering cakes, or salts the meal-offering, or waves it, or presents it; or sets the table with the showbread, or trims the lamps, or takes out the fistful, or receives the blood; If he does any of these outside, he is exempt. One is also not liable for any of these acts on account of not being a priest, or uncleanness, or lack of priestly vestments, or the non-washing of hands and feet.","583":"Before the Tabernacle was set up bamot were permitted and the service was performed by the firstborn. After the Tabernacle was set up bamot were forbidden and the service was performed by priests. Most holy sacrifices were then eaten within the curtains, and lesser sacrifices were eaten anywhere in the camp of the Israelites.","584":"When they came to Gilgal, bamot were again permitted. Most holy sacrifices were eaten within the curtains, and less holy sacrifices were eaten anywhere.","585":"When they came to Shiloh, bamot were forbidden. The Tabernacle there had no roof, but consisted of a base of stones with a ceiling of curtains, and that was the \u201cresting place\u201d referred to in the Torah. Most holy sacrifices were eaten within the curtains, and less holy sacrifices and second tithe   were eaten wherever Shiloh could be seen.","586":"When they came to Nov and to Givon, bamot were again permitted. Most holy sacrifices were eaten within the curtains, and less holy sacrifices in all of the cities of Israel.","587":"When they came to Jerusalem, bamot were forbidden and were never again permitted, and that was the \u2018inheritance\u2019. Most holy sacrifices were eaten within the curtains, and less holy sacrifices and second tithe within the walls of Jerusalem.","588":"All sacrifices consecrated while bamot were forbidden and offered outside while bamot were forbidden involve the transgression of a positive and a negative commandment, and one is liable for karet on their account. If one consecrated them while bamot were permitted, but offered them without when bamot were forbidden, they involve the transgression of a positive and a negative commandment, but one is not liable for karet on their account. If one consecrated them when bamot were forbidden, and offered them when bamot were permitted, they involve the transgression of a positive commandment, but they do not involve the transgression of a negative commandment.","589":"The following sacrifices were offered in the Tabernacle sacrifices consecrated for the Tabernacle: Public sacrifices were offered in the Tabernacle, and private sacrifices were offered at a bamah. If private sacrifices were consecrated for the Tabernacle, they must be offered in the Tabernacle; yet if one offered them at a bamah, he is not liable. What is the difference between the bamah of an individual and the bamah of the congregation? Laying of hands, slaughtering in the north, sprinkling around the altar, waving and presenting, (Rabbi Judah says: there were no meal-offerings at the bamah); priesthood, sacrificial vestments, ministering vessels, a sweet fragrance, a line of demarcation for the sprinkling of the blood, and the washing of hands and feet. But the prohibitions of time, remnant and defilement were the same in both.","590":"An egg laid on Yom Tov: Bet Shammai say: it may be eaten on the same day; But Bet Hillel say: it may not be eaten until the day is over. Bet Shammai say: the quantity of leaven is of the size of an olive and leavened bread is of the size of a date; But Bet Hillel say: both are of the size of an olive.","591":"He who slaughters a wild animal or a bird on a festival   Bet Shammai says: he may dig with a pronged tool and cover up the blood, but Bet Hillel says: he may not slaughter unless he has had earth made ready. But they agree that if he did slaughter he should dig with a pronged tool and cover up the blood, and that the ashes of a stove count as being prepared for the holiday.","592":"Bet Shammai says: one may not carry a ladder on Yom Tov from one dovecote to another, but he may incline it from one pigeon-hole to another. But Bet Hillel permits this. Bet Shammai says: one may not take doves unless he has shaken them the day before Yom Tov: But Bet Hillel says: he stands and declares: this one or that one I am taking.","593":"If he designated black doves but found on Yom Tov white ones, white doves but found black ones, two but found three, they are all forbidden. If he designated three but found two, they are permitted. If he designated doves inside the nest and found them in front of the nest, they are forbidden. But if none were there except these, they are permitted.","594":"Bet Shammai says: one may not remove shutters on Yom Tov. But Bet Hillel permits even to return them to their place. Bet Shammai says: one may not take a pestle even to cut up meat on it. But Bet Hillel permits it. Bet Shammai says: one may not place a hide in front of one who treads upon it nor may he even lift it up unless there is an olive\u2019s worth of flesh on it. But Bet hillel permit it. Bet Shammai says: one may not carry out an infant or a lulav or a Torah scroll into the public domain. But Bet Hillel permit it.","595":"Bet Shammai says: one may not take hallah or priestly gifts to a priest on Yom Tov, whether they were separated on the day before or on that day. But Bet Hillel permits it. Bet Shammai said to them: An analogy supports our view: hallah and priestly gifts go to the priest and terumah likewise goes to the priest; just as one may not take to the priest terumah so one may not take to him priestly gifts. Bet Hillel said to them: No! If you say in the case of terumah which he has not the right to separate, will you say the same with respect to priestly gifts which he is permitted to separate?","596":"Bet Shammai says: spices may be crushed with a wooden pestle and salt in a small cruse or with a wooden ladle. But Bet Hillel says: spices may be crushed in the usual way with a stone pestle and salt with a wooden pestle.","597":"One who sorts beans on Yom Tov:Bet Shammai says: he must sort the edible parts and eat them immediately. But Bet Hillel says: he may sort as usual in his lap or in a basket or in a dish; but not with a board or in a sifter or in a sieve. Rabban Gamaliel says: he may even rinse them in water and skim off the refuse.","598":"Bet Shammai says: one may not send gifts to a neighbor on Yom Tov except portions of food, ready to be eaten. But Bet Hillel says: one may send cattle, game and poultry whether alive or slaughtered. One may also send wine, oil, flour or pulse but not grain. And Rabbi Shimon permits even grain.","599":"One may send clothes, whether they are sewn up or not sewn up, and even though there is kil'ayim in them, provided they are necessary for the festival. But one may not send nailed sandals nor unfinished shoes. Rabbi Judah says: not even white shoes because they still require an artisan to blacken them. This is the general rule: whatever may be used on Yom Tov may also be sent on Yom Tov.","600":"Yom Tov which fell on the eve of Shabbat, one should not begin to cook on Yom Tov for Shabbat. But he may cook for Yom Tov, and if any is left over it is left over for Shabbat. And he may prepare a dish on the eve of Yom Tov and rely upon it to prepare food for Shabbat. Bet Shammai says: two dishes. But Bet Hillel says: one dish. Yet they both agree that a fish and an egg upon it are considered as two dishes. If he ate it or it was lost, he may not begin to cook relying on it. But if he left over any small portion of it, he may rely on it to cook for Shabbat.","601":"If Yom Tov fell on the day after Shabbat:Bet Shammai says: one must immerse everything unclean before Shabbat. But Bet Hillel says: vessels must be immersed before Shabbat but people may immerse on Shabbat.","602":"They agree that one may effect surface contact for unclean water in a stone vessel in order to purify it, but one may not immerse it; And one may immerse to change from one intention to another or from one company to another.","603":"Bet Shammai says: one may bring peace-offerings on Yom Tov but may not lay hands upon them, but one may not bring burnt-offerings on Yom Tov. Bet Hillel says: one may bring peace-offerings and burnt-offerings and also lay hands upon them.","604":"Bet Shammai says: a man may not heat water for his feet unless it is also fit for drinking. But Bet Hillel permits it. A man may make a fire and warm himself at it.","605":"In three cases Rabban Gamaliel was strict like the words of Beth Shammai.One may not cover up hot food on Yom Tov for Shabbat; And one may not join together a lamp on a festival; And one may not bake on Yom thick loaves but only wafer-cakes. Rabban Gamaliel said:  \u201cIn all their days, my father\u2019s house never baked large loaves but only wafer-cakes.\u201d They said to him: \u201cWhat can we do with regards to your father\u2019s house, for they were strict in respect to themselves but were lenient towards Israel to let them bake both large loaves and even charcoal-roasted loaves.\u201d","606":"Also he declared three decisions of a lenient character:One may sweep up on a festival between the couches, And put spices on the coals on a festival; And roast a kid whole on the night of Passover. But the sages forbid them.","607":"Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah allows three things and the Sages forbid them:His cow used to go out with the strap which she had between her horns; One may curry cattle on a festival; And one may grind pepper in its own mill. Rabbi Judah says: one may not curry cattle on a festival, because it may cause a wound, but one may comb them. But the Sages say: one may not curry them, and one may not even comb them.","608":"A pepper-mill is susceptible to impurity on account of it consisting of three separate utensils; on account of a receptacle, on account of a metal utensil and on account of a sifting utensil.","609":"A child\u2019s cart is susceptible to the impurity of midras, and it may be handled on Shabbat, and it is dragged along only on matting. Rabbi Judah says: no vessels may be dragged along the ground except a wagon because it only presses the earth down.","610":"One may not catch fish from a fishpond on Yom Tov nor give them food, But one may catch game or fowl from animal enclosures and one may put food before them. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: not all enclosures are alike. This is the general rule: anything that still needs to be trapped is forbidden but anything that need not be trapped is permitted.","611":"Traps for wild animals, birds or fish which were set on the eve of Yom Tov, one may not take from them on Yom Tov unless he knows that they were already caught on the eve of Yom Tov. It once happened that a certain non-Jew brought fish to Rabban Gamaliel on Yom Tov and he said: they are permitted, but I have no wish to accept them from him.","612":"One may not slaughter on Yom Tov an animal which is about to die unless there is time enough on that day to eat from it as much as an olive of roasted flesh. Rabbi Akiva says: even if there is only time to eat as much as an olive of raw flesh taken from the place of slaughter. If he slaughtered it in the field, he may not bring it in on a pole or a barrow, but he may bring it in piece by piece in his hand.","613":"A first-born beast that fell into a pit:Rabbi Judah says: let an expert go down and inspect it.  If it had a blemish he may bring it up and slaughter it, but if not, he may not slaughter it. Rabbi Shimon says: any animals whose blemish was not observed on the day before the Yom Tov, it is not prepared (mukhan).","614":"If a beast died on Yom Tov it may not be moved from its place. And it happened that they once asked Rabbi Tarfon concerning this and concerning hallah that had become defiled.  He went into the bet midrash and inquired, and they answered him: they may not be moved from their place.","615":"They may not be counted as having a share in an animal at the outset on Yom Tov, but they may be counted as having a share in an animal on the eve of Yom Tov, and they may then slaughter it and divide it between them on Yom Tov. Rabbi Judah says: a man may weigh meat on Yom Tov against a utensil or against a butcher's chopper. But the sages say: one may not pay attention to the scales at all.","616":"One may not sharpen a knife on a festival, but one may draw it over another knife. A man may not say to a butcher, \u201cWeigh me a dinar\u2019s worth of meat\u201d but he may slaughter the animal and shares it among them.","617":"A man may say on Yom Tov to his fellow, \u201cFill me this vessel,\u201d but not in a specific measure. Rabbi Judah says: if it was a measuring-vessel he may not fill it. It happened that Abba Shaul ben Batnit used to fill up his measures on the eve of Yom Tov and give them to his customers on Yom Tov. Abba Shaul says: he used to do so even during hol hamoed (the intermediate days of the festival), on account of clarifying the measures. But the sages say: he used also to do so on an ordinary day for the sake of the draining of the measures. A man may go to a shopkeeper to whom he generally goes and say to him, \u201cGive me so many eggs and nuts\u201d since this is the way of a householder to reckon in his own home.","618":"One who carries jars of wine from place to place, he may not carry them in a basket or in a large basket, but he may carry them on his shoulder or in front of him. Similarly, one who brings straw, he may not drape a large basket over his back, rather he must carry it in his hand. And one may start using a heap of straw, but one may not start using wood from the back-yard.","619":"One may not take wood from a sukkah but only from what is next to it. One may bring in from the field wood that is gathered together, and from a karpef an enclosure even though it is scattered about. What is a karpef?  Any enclosure next to the town, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Yose says: Any enclosure which one enters with a key, even if it is only just within the Shabbat border.","620":"One may not chop up wood, neither from beams nor from a beam which was broken on Yom Tov. And one may not chop with an axe or with a saw or with a sickle but only with a butcher's chopper. A closed room full of produce which was burst open on Yom Tov he may take produce out through the breach. Rabbi Meir says: he may make a hole at the outset and bring out the produce.","621":"One may not make a hole in a lump of clay for use as a lamp because that is making a vessel. One may not make charcoal on Yom Tov. And one may not cut a wick into two. Rabbi Judah says:  he may cut it into two lamps using a fire.","622":"One may not break up a potsherd or cut paper in order to roast on it a salty fish. And one may not rake out an oven or a range, but one may press the ashes down. And one may not place two jars side by side in order to balance upon them saucepan. And one may not prop up a pot with a wooden wedge and the same applies to a door. And one may not drive cattle with a staff on a festival. But Rabbi Elazar the son of Rabbi Shimon permits it.","623":"Rabbi Eliezer says: a man may take a chip from that which is lying before him to pick his teeth with it, and he may collect chips from the court yard and make a fire, for everything in a court is prepared for use on Yom Tov. But the sages say: he may collect only from that which is before him and make a fire.","624":"One may not produce fire either from wood, or from stones, or from dirt, or from water. Nor may one make tiles red-hot in order to roast on them. Rabbi Eliezer further said: A man may stand near his \u201cmuktzeh\u201d on the eve of Shabbat in the sabbatical year and say: \u201cFrom here I will eat tomorrow.\u201d But the sages say: This doesn\u2019t work unless he marks it out and says, \u201cFrom here to there.\u201d","625":"One may let down fruit through a trap-door on Yom Tov but not on Shabbat. And one may cover up fruit with vessels on account of the rain, and likewise jars of wine and jars of oil. And one may place a vessel beneath the drops of rain even on Shabbat.","626":"Every act for which one is liable on Shabbat because of mandated rest shevut, or because it is only optional reshut, or even though it is a religious act mitzvah, he is also liable on Yom Tov.For the following acts he is liable because of shevut: One may not climb a tree, And one may not ride on an animal. And one may not swim in water. And one may not clap hands, nor slap thighs, nor dance. For the following acts he is liable because they are only optional: One may not judge; And one may not betroth a wife, nor perform halizah, nor perform yibbum consumate a levirate marriage. And for the following acts one is liable even though it is a religious act mitzvah: One may not dedicate anything to the Temple, nor vow a personal valuation, nor make a vow of herem, nor set aside terumah or tithes. All these things they the rabbis said that they are forbidden on Yom Tov, how much more so are they forbidden on Shabbat. There is no difference between Yom Tov and Shabbat except for the preparation of food alone.","627":"A beast and utensils are restricted to the same limits as the feet of the owners. One who gives his cow over to his son or to a cowherd to tend, they are restricted to the same limits as the feet of the owner. Vessels which have been set apart for the use of one of the brothers in a house, are restricted to the same limits as his feet, but those utensils which have not been so set apart, can be taken only to a place where all the brothers may go.","628":"One who borrows a vessel from his neighbor on the eve of Yom Tov, it is restricted to the same limits as the feet of the borrower. But if he borrowed it on Yom Tov, it is as the feet of the lender. A woman who borrowed from her neighbor spices, water or salt for her dough, these are restricted to the same limits as the feet of both them. Rabbi Judah exempts in the case of water, because it is not substantial.","629":"A live coal is restricted to the same limits as its owner, but a flame can be taken anywhere. In respect of a live coal of sanctified property one who makes use of it is considered as having trespassed, but as for a flame of sanctified property, one may not derive benefit from it, but one who does has not trespassed. If one carries out a live coal into the public domain on Shabbat he is liable, but if he carries out a flame he is exempt. The water from: A private well is restricted to the same limits as its owner, And the water from a well belonging to the inhabitants of that town is restricted to the same limits as the people of that town; And the water from a well belonging to those who came up from Babylonia is restricted to the same limits as he who draws the water.","630":"If one has his produce in another town, and the inhabitants of that city made an eruv in order to bring to him some of his produce, they may not bring it to him. But if he himself made an eruv, his produce is like himself.","631":"If one invited guests to his home, they may not take away with them any portions unless he the host had assigned for them their portions on the eve of Yom Tov. One may not give drink and then slaughter wilderness animals, but one may give drink and slaughter household animals. The following are household animals: they that spend the night in town. Pasture animals are they that spend the night in pasture ground.","632":"All are obligated to appear at the Temple, except a deaf person,  an imbecile and a minor, a person of unknown sex tumtum, a hermaphrodite, women, unfreed slaves, a lame person, a blind person, a sick person, an aged person, and one who is unable to go up on foot. Who is a minor? Whoever is unable to ride on his father\u2019s shoulders and go up from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount, the words of Bet Shammai. But Bet Hillel say: whoever is unable to hold his father\u2019s hand and go up from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount, as it is said: \u201cThree regalim\u201d (Exodus 23:14).","633":"Bet Shammai say: the pilgrimage-offering must be worth at least two pieces of silver and the hagigah one piece of silver. But Bet Hillel say: the pilgrimage-offering must be worth at least one ma'ah of silver and the hagigah two pieces of silver.","634":"Burnt-offerings during the festival week are to be brought from animals bought with unconsecrated money, and thanksgiving offerings, from animals bought with tithe money. On the first festival day of Pesah: Bet Shammai say: they must be brought from animals bought with unconsecrated money. And Bet Hillel say: they can be brought also from animals bought with tithe money.","635":"Israelites fulfill their obligation with vow-offerings, freewill-offerings and cattle tithe. And priests with sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, firstlings, the breast and the shoulder,   but not with bird-offerings, and not with meal-offerings.","636":"He that has many people to eat with him and little money, brings many thanksgiving-offerings and few burnt-offerings. He that has a lot of money and few to eat with him brings many burnt-offerings and few thanksgiving-offerings. He that has little of either, for him is it is said:  \u201cOne ma'ah of silver\u2019, \u2018two pieces of silver.\u201d He that has a lot of both, of him it is said: \u201cEvery man as he is able, according to the blessing that the Lord your God has bestowed upon you\u201d (Deuteronomy 16:17).","637":"He who did not bring his hagigah on the first day of the festival of Sukkot, may bring it during the whole of the festival, even on the last festival day of Sukkot. If the festival, passed and he did not bring the festival offering, he is no longer liable for it. Of such a person it is said: \u201cA twisted thing cannot be made straight, a lack cannot be made good\u201d (Ecclesiastes 1:15).","638":"Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: Who is \u201ca twisted thing that cannot be made straight?\u201d He who has intercourse with a forbidden relation and bears by her a mamzer.  Should you say that it applies to a thief or robber, he is able to restore the stolen object and make straight. Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai says: They only call something \u201ctwisted\u201d if it was straight at first and then became twisted. And who is this?  A disciple of the sages who forsakes the Torah.","639":"The laws concerning the dissolution of vows hover in the air and have nothing to rest on. The laws concerning Shabbat, hagigot, and trespassing are as mountains hanging by a hair, for they have scant scriptural basis but many halakhot. The laws concerning civil cases and Temple worship, purity and impurity, and the forbidden relations have what to rest on, and they that are the essentials of the Torah.","640":"They may not expound upon the subject of forbidden relations in the presence of three. Nor the work of creation in the presence of two. Nor the work of the chariot in the presence of one, unless he is a sage and understands of his own knowledge. Whoever speculates upon four things, it would have been better had he not come into the world: what is above, what is beneath, what came before, and what came after. And whoever takes no thought for the honor of his creator, it would have been better had he not come into the world.","641":"Yose ben Yoezer says that on a festival the laying of the hands on the head of a sacrifice may not be performed. Yosef ben Johanan says that it may be performed. Joshua ben Perahia says that it may not be performed. Nittai the Arbelite says that it may be performed. Judah ben Tabai says that it may not be performed. Shimon ben Shetah says that it may be performed. Shamayah says that it may be performed. Avtalyon says that it may not be performed. Hillel and Menahem did not dispute. Menahem went out, Shammai entered. Shammai says that it may not be performed. Hillel says that it may be performed. The former of each pair were patriarchs and the latter were heads of the court.","642":"Bet Shammai say: They may bring thanksgiving offerings on Yom Tov but they may not lay their hands on them, and they may not bring wholly burnt-offerings. And Bet Hillel say: They may bring thanksgiving offerings and wholly burnt-offerings and lay their hands on them.","643":"Atzeret which fell on a Friday: Bet Shammai say: the day of the slaughter of the wholly burnt offerings is after Shabbat. And Bet Hillel say: the day of the slaughter is not after Shabbat. They agree, however, that if it falls on Shabbat, the day of the slaughter is after Shabbat. The high priest does not in that case put on his special garments, and mourning and fasting are permitted, in order not to confirm the view of those who say that Atzeret is after Shabbat.","644":"They wash hands for eating unconsecrated food, and second tithe, and for terumah heave-offering. But for sacred food they must immerse their hands in a mikveh. With regard to the water of purification, if one\u2019s hands became impure, one\u2019s whole body is impure.","645":"If he immersed for unconsecrated food, and was presumed to be fit to eat unconsecrated food, he is prohibited from eating second tithe. If he immersed for second tithe, and was presumed to be fit to eat second tithe, he is prohibited from eating terumah. If he immersed for terumah, and was presumed to be fit to eat terumah, he is prohibited from eating holy things. If he immersed for holy things, and was presumed to be fit to eat holy things he is prohibited from touching the waters of purification. If one immersed for something possessing a stricter degree of holiness, one is permitted to have contact with something possessing a lighter degree of holiness. If he immersed but without special intention, it is as though he had not immersed.","646":"The garments of an am haaretz possess midras-impurity for Pharisees. The garments of Pharisees possess midras-impurity for those who eat terumah. The garments of those who eat terumah possess midras-impurity for those who eat sacred things. The garments of those who eat sacred things possess midras-impurity for those who occupy themselves with the waters of purification. Yose ben Yoezer was the most pious in the priesthood, yet his apron was considered to possess midras-impurity for those who ate sacred things. Yohanan ben Gudgada all his life used to eat unconsecrated food in accordance with the purity required for sacred things, yet his apron was considered to possess midras-impurity for those who occupied themselves with the water of purification.","647":"Greater stringency applies to sacred things than to terumah, that they may immerse vessels within vessels together for terumah, but not for sacred things. The outside and inside and handle of a vessel are regarded as separate for terumah, but not for sacred things. One that carries anything possessing midras-uncleanness may carry at the same time terumah, but not sacred things. The garments of those who eat terumah posses midras-uncleanness for those who eat sacred things. The rule for the immersion of garments for those who would eat terumah is not the same as the rule for those who would eat sacred things: for in the case of sacred things, he must first untie any knots in the unclean garment, dry it if it is wet, then immerse it, and afterwards retie it; but in case of terumah, it may first be tied and afterwards immersed.","648":"Vessels that have been finished in purity require immersion before they are used for sacred things, but not before they are used for terumah. A vessel unites all its contents for impurity in the case of sacred things, but not in the case of terumah. Sacred things become invalid by impurity of a fourth degree, but terumah only by impurity of a third degree. In the case of terumah, if one hand of his hands became impure, the other remains clean, but in the case of sacred things, he must immerse both hands, because the one hand defiles the other for sacred things but not for terumah.","649":"They may eat dry foods with impure hands when it comes to terumah, but not when it comes to sacred things. The one who has not yet buried his dead and one who lacks atonement require immersion for sacred things but not for terumah.","650":"Greater stringency applies to terumah than to sacred things, for in Judah the people of the land are trusted in regard to the purity of sacred wine and oil throughout the year; and at the season of the wine-presses and olive-presses even in regard to terumah. If the season of the wine-presses and olive-presses passed, and they brought to him a jar of wine of terumah, he the priest should not accept it from him, but the am ha-aretz may leave it for the coming season of the wine-press. But if he said to him, \u201cI have set apart a quarter log of wine as a sacred thing,\u201d he is believed in regard to the purity of the whole jug. When it comes to jugs of wine and jugs of oil that are meant for terumah, they are believed during the season of the wine-presses and the olive-presses and prior to the season of the wine-presses seventy days.","651":"From Modi\u2019im inwards the potters are trusted in regard to the purity of earthenware vessels; from Modi'im outwards they are not trusted. How so?  A potter who sells the pots entered inwards of Modi'im, then the same potter, the same pots and the same buyers are trusted to be pure. But if he went out from Modi\u2019im outwards he is not trusted.","652":"Tax-collectors who entered a house, and similarly thieves who restored stolen vessels are believed if they say, \u201cWe have not touched anything.\u201d And in Jerusalem they are believed in regard to sacred things, and during a festival also in regard to terumah.","653":"One who opened his jar of wine or broke into his dough to sell them on account of the festival and an am haaretz touched the wine or dough: Rabbi Judah says: he may finish selling them after the festival; But the sages say: he may not finish. When the festival was over, they undertook the purification of the Temple court. If the festival ended on Friday, they did not undertake the purification of the Temple court because of the honor of the Shabbat. Rabbi Judah said: even not on Thursday, for the priests are not free.","654":"How did they undertake the purification of the Temple court?  They immersed the vessels which were in the Temple, and they say to them: \u201cBe cautious lest you touch the table or menorah and defile them.\u201d All the vessels that were in the Temple had second and third sets, so that if the first was defiled, they might bring a second set in its place. All the vessels that were in the Temple required immersion, except the altar of gold and the altar of bronze, for they are like the ground, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But the sages say: because they were overlaid with metal.","655":"The crossbeam of an alley whose entrance is more than twenty cubits high should be lowered. Rabbi Judah says: this is unnecessary. And any entrance that is wider than ten cubits should be reduced in width. But if it has the shape of a doorway there is no need to reduce it even though it is wider than ten cubits.","656":"The validation of an alley: Bet Shammai says: a side-post and a crossbeam. And Bet Hillel says: either a side-post or a crossbeam. R. Eliezer says: two side-posts. In the name of Rabbi Ishmael one student stated in front of Rabbi Akiva: Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel did not disagree concerning an alley that was less than four cubits in width, that it may be validated by either a side-post or a crossbeam. About what did they disagree?  In the case of one that was wider than four, and narrower than ten cubits:  Bet Shammai says: both a side-post and a crossbeam are required and Bet Hillel says: either a side-post or a crossbeam. Rabbi Akiva said they disagree about both cases.","657":"The cross-beam of which they spoke must be wide enough to hold a small brick (ariah), a small brick which is half of a regular brick, the size of three handbreadths. It is enough for the cross-beam to be one handbreadth wide in order to hold the width of a small brick.","658":"Wide enough to hold a half-brick but also strong enough to support such a half-brick. Rabbi Judah says: wide enough, even though it is not strong enough.","659":"If the cross-beam was made of straw or reeds, we look at it as if it was of metal. If it was curved we look at it as if it were straight. If it was round we look at it as if it were square. Whatever has a circumference of three handbreadths has a diameter of one handbreadth.","660":"The side-posts of which they spoke must be no less than ten hand-breadths in height, but their width and thickness may be of any size whatsoever. Rabbi Yose says: their width must be no less than three handbreadths.","661":"One may make the side-posts out of anything, even something that is alive. But Rabbi Yose prohibits this. It also causes defilement as the covering of a tomb, But Rabbi Meir makes pure. One may write on them gittin, But Rabbi Yose the Galilean declares it unfit.","662":"If a caravan camped in a valley and it was surrounded by the instruments used for the cattle it is permissible to move objects within it, provided the instruments form a fence ten handbreadths high and the gaps do not exceed the built-up parts. Any gap which is approximately ten cubits it is permitted to carry within, because it is like an entrance. If it is greater, it is forbidden to carry within.","663":"They may surround the caravan by three ropes, this one above this one, and this one above this one, provided that the space between the one rope and the other is less than three handbreadths. The size of the ropes must be such that their total thickness is more than a handbreadth, so that the total height is ten handbreadths.","664":"They may also surround the camp with reeds, provided there is no gap of three handbreadths between one reed and the next. The rabbis spoke only of a caravan, the words of Rabbi Judah. But the sages say that they only spoke of a caravan because it is a usual occurrence. Any partition that is not made up of both vertical and horizontal pieces is not a valid partition, the words of Rabbi Yose bar Judah. But the sages say: one of the two is sufficient. They exempted four obligations to soldiers in an encampment: They may bring wood from anywhere; they are exempt from the washing of the hands, and from separating tithes from doubtfully tithed produce and from the setting up an eruv.","665":"They may make posts for wells, by setting up four corner-pieces that have the appearance of eight single posts, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir says: eight that have the appearance of twelve, four corner-pieces and four single posts. Their height must be ten handbreadths, their width six, and their thickness may be of any size whatsoever. Between them there may be as much space as to admit two teams of three oxen each, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: two teams of four oxen each . These teams being tied together and not untied, enough for one to enter while the other goes out.","666":"It is permitted to bring the posts close to the well, provided that a cow\u2019s head and the greater part of its body can be within the enclosure when drinking. It is permitted to remove the posts to any distance provided one increases the posts.","667":"Rabbi Judah says: the enclosure may be only as large as two bet se'ah. They said to him: they only prescribed the limit of two beth se\u2019ah for a garden or a karpaf only, but if the enclosure was a pen, or sahar, a backyard or courtyard even if it is five or ten bet kor, it is permitted. And it is permitted to remove the posts to any distance provided one increases the posts.","668":"Rabbi Judah says: if a public road cuts through them it should be diverted to one side; But the sages say: this is not necessary. Both for a public cistern, a public well as well as a private well, they may make an enclosure of posts, but for a private cistern, they must make a partition ten handbreadths high, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Judah ben Baba says: they make an enclosure of posts for a public well only while for the others they must make a belt ten handbreadths high.","669":"Rabbi Judah ben Bava further said: a garden or a karpaf whose area does not exceed seventy cubits and a fraction by seventy cubits and a fraction, which is surrounded by a fence ten handbreadths high, it is permitted to carry within it, provided there is in it a watchman\u2019s hut or a dwelling place or it is near to a town. Rabbi Judah says: even if it contained only a cistern, a ditch or a cave it is permitted to carry within it. Rabbi Akiva says: even if it contained none of these it is permitted to carry within it, provided its area does not exceed seventy cubits and a fraction by seventy cubits and a fraction. Rabbi Eliezer says: if its length exceeded its breadth even by a single cubit it is not permitted to carry within it. Rabbi Yose says: even if its length is twice its breadth it is permitted to carry within it.","670":"Rabbi Ilai said:  I heard from Rabbi Eliezer, even if it is as large as a bet kor. I also heard from him that if one of the residents of a courtyard forgot to join in the eruv, his house is forbidden to him for taking in or taking out any object but it is permitted to them. I also heard from him that people may fulfill their duty for bitter herbs at Pesach by eating hart\u2019s tongue (akrevanim). I went round among all his disciples seeking a fellowstudent but I found none.","671":"With all kinds of food they may make an \u2018eruv and a shittuf, except water and salt. And all kinds of food may be purchased with money of the second tithe, except water and salt. One who vowed to abstain from food is allowed to consume both water and salt. An eruv may be prepared for a nazirite with wine and for an Israelite with terumah, But Symmachus says: with unconsecrated produce only. An eruv may be prepared for a priest in a bet hapras. Rabbi Judah says: even in a cemetary, because he can put up a partition and thus enter the area and eat his eruv.","672":"They may make an eruv with demai (doubtfully tithed produce), or with first tithe from which terumah had been taken, or with second tithe or consecrated food that have been redeemed; and priests may make their eruv with hallah and terumah. It may not be prepared, with untithed produce, nor with first tithe from which terumah has not been taken, nor with second tithe or consecrated food that have not been redeemed. One who sends his eruv in the hands of a deaf-mute, imbecile or a minor, or with one who does not admit the principle of eruv, the eruv is not valid. If, however, he instructed another person to receive it from him, the eruv is valid.","673":"If he put the eruv in a tree above a height of ten handbreadths, his eruv is not valid; below ten handbreadths, his eruv is valid. If he put it in a cistern, even if it is a hundred cubits deep, his eruv is valid. If he put it on the top of a reed or on the top of a pole, if it had been uprooted and then inserted in the ground, even though it was a hundred cubits high, the eruv is valid. If it he put it in a chest and the key was lost, the eruv is nevertheless valid. Rabbi Eliezer says: if he does not know that the key is in its place, the eruv is invalid.","674":"An eruv which rolled away beyond the Shabbat limit, or a heap of stones fell on it, or was burnt, or was terumah and became impure: If one of these occurred while it was yet day, it is invalid, But if it occurred after it became dark the eruv is valid. If it is doubtful when it occurred: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Judah say: this is a donkey-driver\/camel driver. Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon say: a doubtful eruv is valid. Rabbi Yose says: Avtulmos testified on the authority of five elders that a doubtful eruv is valid.","675":"A man may make a stipulation concerning his eruv and say, \u201cIf foreigners came from the east, let my eruv be that of the west; if they came from the west let my eruv be that of the east; if they came from both directions, I will go in whatever direction I desire; and if they came from neither direction I will be like the people of my town.\u201d Likewise say, \u201cIf a sage came from the east let my eruv be that of the east; if from the west let my eruv be that of the west; If he came from either direction I will go in whatever direction I desire; and if no one came from either direction I will be like the people of my town.\u201d Rabbi Judah says: if one of them was his teacher he may go only to his teacher, but if both were his teachers he may go in whatever direction he prefers.","676":"Rabbi Eliezer says: if a festival day immediately precedes or follows Shabbat a man may prepare two eruvs and make the following declaration: \u201cmy eruv for the first day is that of the east and for the second day is that of the west\u201d; \u201cthe one for the first day is that of the west and the one for the second day is that of the east\u201d; \u201cmy eruv is for the first day, and for the second day I will be as the people of my town\u201d; or \u201cmy eruv is for the second day, and for the first day I will be as the people of my town\u201d. But the sages say: he either prepares an eruv for one direction or none at all; he either prepares one eruv for the two days or none at all. How should he act? He brings the eruv on the first day, he lets it get dark and then he takes it and goes away.  On the second day he again carries the eruv to the same place and lets it grow dark and then he may eat it.  He thus benefits both in his going and in eating his eruv. If the eruv was eaten up on the first day it remains effective for the first day but not for the second. Rabbi Eliezer said to them: you do then agree with me that they are two distinct holinesses.","677":"Rabbi Judah says: if on the eve of the New Year a man was afraid that the preceding month of Elul might be intercalated, he may prepare two eruvs and make this declaration: \u201cMy eruv for the first day is that to the east and the one for the second day is that to the west\u201d; \u201cthe one for the first day is that to the west and the one for the second day is that to the east\u201d; \u201cmy eruv is for the first day, and for the second I shall be as the people of my town\u201d; \u201cmy eruv is for the second day, and for the first I shall be as the people of my town.\u201d But the sages did not agree with him.","678":"Rabbi Judah further said: a man may stipulate concerning a basket of produce on the first festival day of Rosh Hashanah and may then eat it on the second day, And so also if an egg was laid on the first festival day it may be eaten on the second. But the sages did not agree with him.","679":"Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas says: the person who goes in front of the ark on the first day of of Rosh Hashanah says: \u201cStrengthen us, o Lord our God, on this first day of the month, whether it be today or tomorrow\u201d; and on the following day he says: \u2018Strengthen us... whether it be today or yesterday.\u201d But the sages did not agree with him.","680":"One whom Gentiles, or an evil spirit, have taken out beyond the Shabbat border has no more than four cubits in which to move. If they brought him back, it is as if he had never gone out. If they took him to another town, or if they put him in a pen or a sahar: Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah say he may move throughout the entire area; But Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Akiva says: he has only four cubits in which to move. It once happened that they were coming from Brindisi and their ship sailed out to sea on Shabbat.  Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah walked about throughout its area, but Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Akiba did not move beyond four cubits because they wanted to be stringent upon themselves.","681":"Once they did not enter the harbor until dusk on Shabbat eve. They asked Rabban Gamaliel, \u201cCan we disembark?\u201d He said to them, \u201cYou may for I was already observing and we were already within the Shabbat limit before it grew dark.\u201d","682":"One who went beyond the Shabbat limit with permission and was then told that the act had already been performed, he is allowed to move within two thousand cubits in any direction. If he was within the Shabbat limit, it is as if he had not gone out. All who go out to save life may return to their original places.","683":"One who sat down on the road at dusk on Friday eve and then got up and saw that he was near a town he may not enter it, since it had not been his intention to do so, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: he may enter it. Rabbi Judah said: it once actually happened and Rabbi Tarfon entered the town, even though this was not his intention when Shabbat had begun.","684":"If one slept on the road and was unaware that night had fallen, he may move two thousand cubits in any direction, the words of Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri. But the sages say:  he has only four cubits within which to move. Rabbi Eliezer says: and the man is deemed to be in the middle of them. Rabbi Judah says: he may move in any direction he desires. And Rabbi Judah agrees that once chosen his direction he may not go back on it.","685":"Two men, some of whose cubits enter into the cubits of the other, may bring their meals and eat them in the middle, provided that this one does not carry out anything from his limit into that of the other. If there were three men and the prescribed limit of the middle one overlapped with the limits of the others, he is permitted to eat with either of them and either of them is permitted to eat with him, but the two outer persons are forbidden to eat with one another. Rabbi Shimon said:  To what is this similar? To three courtyards that open one into the other and also into a public domain: If they made an eruv for the outer ones with the middle one, the middle one is permitted with them and they are permitted with it, but the two outer ones are forbidden access to one another.","686":"One who was on a journey and it became dark, and he recognized a tree or a fence and said, \u201cLet my Shabbat place be under it\u201d, he has said nothing. If he said, \u201cLet my Shabbat place be at its root\u201d,  he may walk from the place where he stands to its root a distance of two thousand cubits, and from its root to his house another two thousand cubits. Thus he can walk four thousand cubits after dusk.","687":"If he does not recognize any tree or fence, or if he is not familiar with the halakhah, and said, \u201cLet my present position be my Shabbat place\u201d, his position acquires for him the right of movement two thousand cubits in any direction. In a circle, the words of Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus. But the sages say: the distances are square, in the shape of a square tablet, so that he may gain the area of the corners.","688":"This is what the rabbis have said:  \u201ca poor man makes his eruv with his feet.\u201d Rabbi Meir said: we can apply this law to a poor man only. Rabbi Judah says: it applies to both rich and poor; they only said that an eruv is prepared with bread in order to make it easier for the rich man, so that he does not have to go out and make the eruv with his feet.","689":"One who left to go to a town with which his home town is wished to be connected by an eruv, but a friend of his returned him home, he himself is allowed to go to the other town but all the other townspeople are forbidden, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir says: whoever is able to prepare an eruv and neglected to do so is like one who is both a donkey-driver and a camel-driver.","690":"One who went out beyond his Shabbat limit, even one cubit may not re-enter. Rabbi Eliezer says: if he went two cubits beyond his Shabbat limit he may re-enter, three cubits he may not re-enter. One who was overtaken by dusk when only one cubit outside the Shabbat limit may not enter the Shabbat border. Rabbi Shimon says: even if he was fifteen cubits away he may enter since the surveyors do not measure exactly on account of those who err.","691":"How do they make extensions for cities for the purpose of defining the Shabbat limit?If one house recedes and another projects, Or if one turret of the wall recedes and another projects, If there were ruins ten handbreadths high, or bridges, or sepulchral monuments that contained dwelling places, they extend the boundary of the town is to include them. And they make it the Shabbat limit like a square tablet in order that the use of the corners might be gained.","692":"They give a karpaf as an extension for every town, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: they said the of a karpaf only in regard to two towns that if there was to this one a piece of land of seventy cubits and a fraction and to the other one a piece of land seventy cubits and a fraction, they can consider the karpaf as combining the two into one.","693":"So also three villages arranged in the shape of a triangle, if between the two outer ones there is a distance of a hundred and forty-one and a third cubits, the middle one causes all the three of them to be regarded as one.","694":"They measure the Shabbat limit only with a rope fifty cubits long, neither less nor more. And one should measure only while holding the end of the rope on a level with his heart. If he was measuring and he reached a valley or a wall he spans it and resumes his measuring. If he reached a hill he spans it and resumes his measuring, provided he does not go beyond the Shabbat limit. If he is unable to span it   in connection with this Rabbi Dostai ben Yannai stated in the name of Rabbi Meir:  \u201cI have heard that they pierce the hills.\u201d","695":"They measure the Shabbat limit only through an expert. If he extended the limit at one point and limited it at another, they observe the place where he extended it. If there was one who made it a greater distance and one who made it a lesser distance, the greater distance is observed. Even a slave and even a female slave are believed when they say, \u201cThus far is the Shabbat limit\u201d, since the sages did not enact the law in order to be strict but in order to be lenient.","696":"If a town that belonged to an individual was converted into one belonging to the many, they may make an eruv for the entire town. But if a town belonged to the many and was converted into one belonging to an individual, they may not make an eruv for the entire town unless they excluded from it a section the size of the town of Hadashah in Judea, which contains fifty residents, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Shimon says: three courtyards each of which contains two houses.","697":"If one was in the east and said to his son, \u201cPrepare for me an eruv in the west\u201d, or if he was in the west and he said to his son, \u201cPrepare for me an eruv in the east\u201d, if the distance between him and his house was no more than two thousand cubits   and that between him and his eruv was more than this, he is permitted to go to his house but forbidden to go to his eruv. If the distance to his eruv was no more than two thousand cubits and that to his house more than this, he is forbidden to go to his house but permitted to go to his eruv. One who puts his eruv within the extension of a town, he has done nothing. If he put it even one cubit only beyond the limit he loses what he gains.","698":"The people of a large town may walk through the whole of a small town, but the people of a small town may not walk through the whole of a large town. How is this so? If a man was in a large town and deposited his eruv in a small town   or if he stayed in a small town and deposited his eruv in a large town, he may walk through all the town and two thousand cubits beyond it. Rabbi Akiva says: he only has the place of his eruv and another two thousand cubits.","699":"Rabbi Akiva said to them:  Do you not agree with me that one who puts his eruv in a cave may walk no further than two thousand cubits from the place of his eruv? They replied: when is this true? Only where no people dwell in it, but where people dwell in it one may walk through the whole of it and two thousand cubits beyond it. Thus where an eruv is put within the cave the law is more lenient than where one is put on top of it. And to the measurer, of whom they spoke, they give him a distance of two thousand cubits even if the end of his measure terminates within a cave.","700":"One who lives in a courtyard with a non-Jew or with one who does not acknowledge the principle of eruv, behold this one restricts him from making use of the eruv, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: one can never restrict another from making use of the eruv unless there are two Jews who restrict each other.","701":"Rabban Gamaliel said: A Sadducee once lived with us in the same alley in Jerusalem and father told us:  \u201cHurry up and carry out all vessels into the alley before he carries out his and thereby restricts you\u201d. Rabbi Judah said the instruction was given in different language:  \u201cHurry up and perform all of your needs in the alley before he carries out his and thereby restricts you\u201d.","702":"If one of the residents of a courtyard forgot to join in the eruv, his house is forbidden both to him and to them for the taking in or for the taking out of any object. But their houses are permitted both to him and to them. If they gave their part of the courtyard to him, he is permitted but they are forbidden. If there were two who forgot to join in the eruv, they restrict each other, because one may give his part and also acquire the part of others but two may give their parts but may not acquire the parts of others.","703":"When must they give away their share courtyard or alley? Bet Shammai says: while it is yet day, And Bet Hillel says: after dusk. One who gave away his share and then carried out an object, whether unwittingly or intentionally, he restricts the others from carrying in the courtyard or alley, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: if he acted with intention he restricts the others, but if unwittingly he does not restrict.","704":"A householder who was in partnership with his neighbors:  with this one in wine and with the other in wine, they need not prepare an eruv. But if his partnership was with the one in wine and with the other in oil, they must make an eruv. Rabbi Shimon says: neither in the one case nor in the other need they make an eruv.","705":"Five companies of men who spent Shabbat in one hall:: Bet Shammai says:  an eruv for each and every company; But Bet Hillel says: one eruv for them all. They agree that where some of them occupy rooms or upper chambers, that they must make an eruv for each and every company.","706":"Brothers who are partners who were eating at their father\u2019s table but slept in their own homes must each have an eruv. Hence, if any one of them forgot and did not contribute to the eruv, he must annul his right to his share in the courtyard. When does this apply?  When they bring their eruv into some other place but if their eruv is deposited with them or if there are no other tenants with them in the courtyard they need not prepare any eruv.","707":"Five courtyards which were each opened into the other and into an alley, and they made an eruv for the courtyards but they did not share in a shittuf for the alley, they are permitted the use of the courtyards but forbidden that of the alley. If they shared in a shittuf for the alley but not in the eruv for the courtyards, they are permitted the use of both. If they made an eruv for the courtyards and they made a shittuf for the alley, and one of the tenants of a courtyard forgot to contribute to the eruv, they are permitted the use of both. If one of the residents of the alley forgot to share in the shittuf, they are permitted the use of the courtyards but forbidden that of the alley, Since an alley to its courtyards is as a courtyard to its houses.","708":"Two courtyards, this one inside the other:If the residents of the inner one prepared an eruv but those of the outer one did not prepare an eruv, the inner one is permitted but the outer one is forbidden. If the residents of the outer one prepared an eruv but not those of the inner one, they both are forbidden. If the residents of each courtyard prepared an eruv for themselves, each is permitted on its own. Rabbi Akiva forbids the outer one because the right to walk in it prohibits it. The sages say that the right of way does not prohibit it.","709":"If one of the residents of the outer courtyard forgot to participate in the eruv, the inner courtyard is permitted but the outer one is forbidden. If one of the residents of the inner courtyard forgot to contribute to the eruv, both courtyards are forbidden. If they gave their eruv in the same place and one resident, whether of the inner courtyard or of the outer courtyard, forgot to contribute to the eruv, both courtyards are forbidden. If the courtyards belonged to individuals, they need not prepare any eruv.","710":"If a window between two courtyards was four handbreadths by four handbreadths, and was within ten handbreadths from the ground, the tenants prepare two eruvin or, if they want, they may prepare one. If the size of the window was less than four handbreadths by four handbreadths or higher than ten handbreadths from the ground, they may prepare two eruvin but not one.","711":"If a wall between two courtyards was ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths thick, two eruvin must be prepared, but not one. If there was produce on top of it, the residents from this side may climb up and eat and those from this side may climb up and eat, provided they do not bring it down. If the wall was breached a breach of ten cubits, the residents prepare two eruvin or, if they prefer, they prepare one eruv, because it is like a doorway. If the breach was bigger, only one eruv and not two may be prepared.","712":"If a ditch between two courtyards was ten handbreadths deep and four handbreadths wide, they may make two eruvin but not one, even if it was full of stubble or straw. If it was full of earth or gravel, only one eruv may be prepared, but not two.","713":"If he placed over it a board four handbreadths wide, and so also where two balconies   are opposite one another, the residents may prepare two eruvin or, if they prefer, only one. If the board was less wide two eruvs may be prepared, but not one.","714":"If a heap of straw between two courtyards yards was ten handbreadths high, they make two eruvin but not one. These may feed their cattle from this side and these may feed from the other side. If the height of the straw heap was reduced to less than ten handbreadths, one eruv may be prepared but not two.","715":"How does one make an \u201calley partnership\u201d? One of the residents places a jar and declares, \u201cBehold, this belongs to all the residents of the alley\u201d, and he confers possession upon the other residents through his adult son or daughter, through his Hebrew servant or maidservant or through his wife. But he may not confer possession through his minor son or daughter or through his Canaanite slave or female slave, because their hand is as his hand.","716":"If the food was reduced, he must add to it and confer possession upon the other residents but he need not inform them. If the number of residents has increased, he must add food and confer possession upon them, and he must inform them.","717":"What is the quantity required?When the residents are many there should be food sufficient for two meals for all of them; And when they are few there should be food of the size of a dried fig for each one.","718":"Rabbi Yose says: When does this apply? To the beginnings of the eruv but in the case of the remnants of an eruv even the smallest quantity of food is sufficient, They said that one should set up an eruv for courtyards only so that the law should not be forgotten by the children.","719":"They may set up an eruv or a shittuf with all kinds of food except for water or salt, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Joshua says: a whole loaf of bread is a valid eruv. Even a baking of one se\u2019ah, if it is a broken loaf, may not be used for eruv while a loaf of the size of an issar, provided it is whole, may be used for  eruv.","720":"A man may give a ma\u2019ah to a shopkeeper or a baker in order to acquire a share in the eruv, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. The sages say: his money acquires no share for him They agree that in the case of all other men his money may acquire an eruv for him, Since they do not prepare an eruv except with one\u2019s consent. Rabbi Judah says: To what does this apply? To Shabbat border eruvin, but in the case of courtyard eruvin they prepare an eruv with his consent and without his consent, since they confer a benefit on a person in his absence but they do not confer a disability on a person except in his presence.","721":"How does one effect participation in connection with Shabbat limits? One sets down a jar and says, \u201cBehold this is for all the inhabitants of my town, for anyone who may desire to go to a house of mourning or to a house of feasting\u201d. Any one who accepted the eruv while it was still day is permitted to enjoy its benefits but if one did it after dusk he is forbidden, since they do not set up an eruv after dusk.","722":"What is the minimum measure for Shabbat border eruvin?Food for two meals for each person, for weekdays and not for Shabbat, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: for Shabbat and not for weekdays. And both intended to give a leniency. Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka says: not less than a loaf that is purchased for a pondium when the price of wheat is four se\u2019ah for a sela. Rabbi Shimon says:  two thirds of a loaf, when three loaves are made from a kav of wheat. Half of this loaf is the size prescribed for a leprous house, and half of its half is the size that disqualifies one\u2019s body from eating terumah.","723":"If the tenants of a courtyard and the tenants of its gallery forgot and did not participate together in the eruv, anything that is higher than ten handbreadths belongs to the residents of the gallery, and anything lower belongs to the residents of the courtyard. The rim around a cistern, or a rock, if they are ten handbreadths high they belong to the gallery but if lower than they belong to the courtyard. To what does this apply? To one that is adjacent to the gallery, but one that is distanced from it, even if ten handbreadths high, belongs to the courtyard. And what is regarded as adjacent? One that is not further than four handbreadths.","724":"If one put his eruv in a gate-house, a portico or a gallery it is not a valid eruv; And one who dwells in it does not prohibit others from carrying if he doesn\u2019t participate in the eruv. If one put his eruv in a straw-shed, a cattle-shed, a wood-shed or storehouse it is a valid eruv; And one who dwells in it prohibits others from carrying if he doesn\u2019t participate in the eruv. Rabbi Judah says: if the householder has there any ownership the resident does not prohibit.","725":"One who leaves his house and goes to spend Shabbat in another town, whether he was a Gentile or an Israelite, he prohibits the other residents from using the eruv, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: he does not prohibit. Rabbi Yose says: a Gentile prohibits but an Israelite does not prohibit because it is not usual for an Israelite to return on Shabbat. Rabbi Shimon says: even if he left his house and went to spend Shabbat with his daughter in the same town he does not prohibit, since he turned his attention away.","726":"A cistern between two courtyards they do not fill up from it on Shabbat, unless they made for it a partition ten handbreadths high, whether above, below or from its rim. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: Bet Shammai say: below, And Bet Hillel say: above. Rabbi Judah said: the partition could not be more effective than the wall between the two courtyards.","727":"A water channel that passes through a courtyard  they do not draw water from there on Shabbat unless they made for it a partition ten handbreadths high at its entrance and exit. Rabbi Judah says: the wall above it may be regarded as a partition. Rabbi Judah said: it happened with the water-channel of Avel that they would draw water was from it on Shabbat on the authority of the elders. They said to him: because it was not of the prescribed size.","728":"A balcony that was situated above the water, they do not draw water from there on Shabbat, unless they made for it a partition ten handbreadths high either above or below the water. So also two balconies, one on top of the other. If they made a partition for the upper one but not for the lower one, they are both prohibited until they make an eruv.","729":"A courtyard which is less than four cubits:  they may not pour out water in it on Shabbat unless they made a trough holding two se\u2019ah from its drainage point   downwards, regardless of whether the trough was outside or inside, except that if it was outside it is necessary to cover it and if it inside it is not necessary to cover it.","730":"Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: a sewage drain which is covered over four cubits in the public domain, it is permitted to pour water into it on Shabbat. But the Sages say: even where a roof or a courtyard was a hundred cubits in area, he may not pour water over the mouth of the drain, but he may pour upon the roof, and the water will flow into the drain. The courtyard and the portico combined to make up the four cubits.","731":"So too in the case of two two-storied buildings this one opposite that one:  if some of the tenants made a trough and others did not, those who made the trough are permitted to pour down their water, but those who did not make any trough are forbidden.","732":"All the roofs of a town are a single domain, provided no roof is ten handbreadths higher or lower than the neighboring roof, the words of Rabbi Meir. The Sages say: each one is its own domain. Rabbi Shimon says: roofs, courtyards and karpafs are all one domain with regard to objects that were within them when Shabbat began, but not with regard to objects that were in the house when Shabbat began.","733":"A large roof close to a small roof: the large one is permitted but that of the small one is forbidden. If the wall of a large courtyard which shared a wall with a small courtyard was broken down, the use of  the large one is permitted, but that of the smaller one is forbidden, because the gap is like a doorway to the large one. If the wall of a courtyard which shared a wall with the public domain was broken down, one who brings from it into a private domain or from a private domain into it is liable, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. The sages say: from it into the public domain or from the public domain into it he is exempt because it is like a karmelit.","734":"A courtyard whose walls were breached from two sides, and so also a house whose walls were breached from two of its sides, or an alley from which the cross-beam or side-post was removed:They are permitted for that Shabbat but prohibited for the future, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Yose says: if they are permitted on that Shabbat they are also permitted for the future and if they are prohibited in the future, they are also prohibited for that Shabbat.","735":"One who builds an upper room on the top of two houses, and so too in the case of viaducts, they may carry underneath them on Shabbat, the words of Rabbi Judah. But the sages prohibit this. Rabbi Judah moreover said: an eruv may be prepared for an alley that is a thoroughfare; But the sages forbid this.","736":"One who finds tefillin should bring them in one pair at a time. Rabban Gamaliel says: two pairs at a time. To what does this apply?  To old ones but in the case of new ones he is exempt. If he found them arranged in a set or in bundles he shall wait by them until it is dark and then bring them in. In a time of danger, he should cover them and walk away.","737":"Rabbi Shimon says: he should pass them the tefillin to his fellow and his fellow should pass them to his fellow, and so on, until they reach the outermost courtyard. The same is true in the case of his child:  he passes him to his fellow and his fellow passes him to his fellow, and so on, even if there are a hundred. Rabbi Judah says: one may pass a jar to his fellow and his fellow may pass it to his fellow even beyond the Shabbat limit. They said to him: this must not go further than the feet of its owner.","738":"If one was reading a scroll on a threshold and the scroll rolled out of his hand, he may roll it back to himself. If he was reading on the top of a roof and the scroll rolled out of his hand: Before it reached ten handbreadths from the ground, he may roll it back to himself; But after it had reached ten handbreadths from the ground he must turn it over with its writing downwards. Rabbi Judah says: even if it was removed from the ground by no more than a thread's thickness he may roll it back to himself. Rabbi Shimon says: even if it touched the actual ground he may roll it back to himself, since no prohibition that is due to \u201cShabbat rest\u201d stands before the Holy Writings.","739":"If there was a ledge in front of a window it is permitted to put objects on it or to remove objects from it on Shabbat. A man may stand in a private domain and move objects in a public domain or he may stand in a public domain and move objects in a private domain, provided he does not take them beyond four cubits.","740":"A man may not stand in a private domain and urinate in a public domain or in a public domain and urinate in a private domain, and similarly he may not spit. Rabbi Judah says: even when a person\u2019s spit accumulated in his mouth, he must not walk four cubits before he spat out.","741":"A man may not stand in a private domain and drink in the public domain or stand in a public domain and drink in a private domain unless he puts his head and the greater part of his body into the domain in which he drinks. And similarly concerning a winepress. A man may intercept water from a gutter at a level below ten handbreadths, And from a water-spout he may drink in any manner.","742":"If a cistern in a public domain had an embankment ten handbreadths high, it is permitted to draw water from it on the sabbath through a window above it. If a garbage heap in a public domain was ten handbreadths high, it is permitted to pour water on it on Shabbat from a window above it.","743":"If a tree overshadows the ground:  if its branches are not higher than three handbreadths from the ground it is permitted to carry underneath it. If its roots are three handbreadths high above the ground, one may not sit on them. With the door in the \u201cmuktzeh\u201d, and the thorns in the breach of a wall and reed mats, one may not close an opening, unless they are high off the ground.","744":"A man may not stand in a private domain and open a door in the public domain, or in the public domain and open a door in a private domain, unless he has made a partition ten handbreadths high, the words of Rabbi Meir. They said to him: it happened at the oxen and chicken fatteners\u2019 market in Jerusalem that they would lock their shops and leave the key in a window above a shop door. Rabbi Yose says: it was the wool-dealers\u2019 market.","745":"A bolt which has a knob at one end: Rabbi Eliezer forbids it to be moved; But Rabbi Yose permits it. Rabbi Eliezer said: It happened in a synagogue in Tiberias that they were customary to permit it, until Rabban Gamaliel and the elders came and forbade it to them. Rabbi Yose said: they treated it as forbidden, Rabban Gamaliel and the elders came and permitted it to them.","746":"A bolt that drags along the ground:  it is permitted to lock a door with it in the Temple but not in the country; But one that rests on the ground is forbidden both here and there. Rabbi Judah says: one that rests on the ground is permitted in the Temple but one that drags on the ground is permitted even in the country.","747":"A lower hinge of a door may be reinserted in the Temple but not in the country.   The upper one is forbidden in both. Rabbi Judah says: the upper one may be re-inserted in the Temple and the lower one in the country.","748":"One may replace a plaster bandage on a wound in the Temple but not in the country. At the outset, it is prohibited in both. A harp string may be tied up in the Temple but not in the country. At the outset, it is prohibited in both. One may remove a wart in the Temple but not in the country. If the operation must be performed with an instrument it is forbidden in both.","749":"A priest who was wounded in his finger may wrap some reed-grass round it in the Temple but not in the country. But if he intended to draw out blood it is forbidden in both cases. They scatter salt on the altar\u2019s ramp so that the priests shall not slip. They draw water by means of a wheel on Shabbat from the cistern of the exiles and from the great cistern, and on a festival day from the Hakar cistern.","750":"If a dead creeping thing was found in the Temple, a priest should carry it out in his girdle in order not to keep the impurity there any longer than is necessary, the words of Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka. Rabbi Judah says: it should be removed with wooden tongs in order that uncleanness shall not increase. From where must it be removed? From the sanctuary, from the hall, and from between the hall and the altar, the words of Rabbi Shimon ben Nanas. Rabbi Akiva says: from any place where karet is incurred for entering intentionally and a sin-offering for entering in error from there it must be removed, and from any other place they cover it with a large pot. Rabbi Shimon says:   wherever the sages have permitted you anything they have only given you what is really yours, since they have only permitted you that which is forbidden as shevut.","751":"<b>The Megilla is read on the eleventh, on the twelfth, on the thirteenth, on the fourteenth,<\/b> or <b>on the fifteenth<\/b> of the month of Adar, <b>not earlier and not later.<\/b> The mishna explains the circumstances when the Megilla is read on each of these days. <b>Cities <i>kerakin<\/i> that have been surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun, read<\/b> the Megilla <b>on the fifteenth<\/b> of Adar, whereas <b>villages and large towns<\/b> that have not been walled since the days of Joshua, son of Nun, <b>read<\/b> it <b>on the fourteenth.

The first is: <b>The difference between Festivals and Shabbat<\/b> with regard to the labor prohibited on those days <b>is only<\/b> in <b>preparing food alone.<\/b> It is permitted to cook and bake in order to prepare food on Festivals; however, on Shabbat it is prohibited. <b>The difference between Shabbat and Yom Kippur<\/b> with regard to the labor prohibited on those days <b>is only that<\/b> in <b>this<\/b> case, i.e., Shabbat, <b>its intentional<\/b> desecration is punishable <b>at the hand of Man,<\/b> as he is stoned by a court based on the testimony of witnesses who forewarned the transgressor; <b>and<\/b> in <b>that<\/b> case, i.e., Yom Kippur, <b>its intentional<\/b> desecration is punishable at the hand of God, <b>with <i>karet<\/i>.<\/b>","756":"<b>The difference between one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow and one for whom benefit from<\/b> another\u2019s <b>food is forbidden by vow is only<\/b> with regard to <b>stepping foot<\/b> on his property, <b>and<\/b> with regard to borrowing <b>utensils<\/b> from him <b>that one does not use<\/b> in the <b>preparation of food,<\/b> but for other purposes; as those two benefits are prohibited to the former, but permitted to the latter. <b>The difference between<\/b> animals consecrated to the Temple as <b>vow<\/b> offerings <b>and<\/b> animals consecrated as <b>gift<\/b> offerings <b>is only that<\/b> in the case of <b>vow<\/b> offerings, if they died or were lost before being sacrificed on the altar, one <b>is obligated in<\/b> the <b>responsibility<\/b> to replace <b>them, and<\/b> in the case of <b>gift<\/b> offerings, if they died or were lost, one <b>is not obligated in<\/b> the <b>responsibility<\/b> to replace <b>them.<\/b>","757":"<b>The difference between a <i>zav<\/i> who experiences two emissions<\/b> of a pus-like discharge from his penis <b>and one who experiences three<\/b> emissions <b>is only<\/b> that the <i>zav<\/i> who experienced three emissions is obligated to bring <b>an offering<\/b> after he recovers, in order to complete his purification process. <b>The difference between a quarantined leper,<\/b> i.e., one examined by a priest who found his symptoms to be inconclusive, and who must therefore remain in isolation for a period of up to two weeks waiting to see if conclusive symptoms develop; <b>and a confirmed leper,<\/b> i.e., one whose symptoms were conclusive and the priest declared him an absolute leper, <b>is only<\/b> with regard to <b>letting<\/b> the hair on one\u2019s head grow <b>wild and rending<\/b> one\u2019s garments.

When all wail in unison. What is meant by a lament?  When one speaks and all respond after her, as it is said: \u201cAnd teach your daughters wailing and one another each lamentation\u201d (Jeremiah 9:19). But as to the future, it says: \u201cHe will destroy death forever, and the Lord God will wipe away the tears from all faces\u201d (Isaiah 25:9).","808":"On the evening of the fourteenth of Nissan they search they house for chametz by the light of a lamp. Every place into which chametz is not brought does not require searching, So why did they rule: two rows of the wine cellar must be searched?  This is actually a place into which chametz might be taken. Bet Shammai say: two rows over the front of the whole cellar; But Bet Hillel say: the two outer rows, which are the uppermost.","809":"They need not fear that a weasel may have dragged chametz from one room to another or from one place to another, for if so, they must also fear from courtyard to courtyard and from town to town, and there would be no end to the matter.","810":"Rabbi Judah says: they search on the evening of the fourteenth and in the morning of the fourteenth, and at the time of destroying. But the sages say: if he did not search in the evening of the fourteenth he must search on the fourteenth; if he did not search in the morning of the fourteenth, he must search during the festival; if he did not search during the festival, he must search after the festival. And what he leaves over he must put away in a hidden place, so that he should not need searching after it.","811":"Rabbi Meir says: one may eat chametz the whole of the five hours and must burn it at the beginning of the sixth. Rabbi Judah says: one may eat the whole of the four hours, suspend it the whole of the fifth, and must burn it at the beginning of the sixth.","812":"Rabbi Judah further said: two unfit loaves of thanksgiving used to lie on the roof of the Temple portico:  as long as they lay there all the people would eat chametz. When one was removed, they would keep it in suspense, neither eating nor burning it. When both were removed, all the people began to burn their chametz. Rabban Gamaliel says: non-sacred chametz may be eaten the whole of the four hours and terumah the whole of the five hours and they burn them at the beginning of the sixth hour.","813":"Rabbi Hanina the vice-chief of the priests says: during all of the days of the priests they never refrained from burning sacrificial meat which had been defiled by an offspring of uncleanness with meat which had been defiled by a father of uncleanness, even though they add uncleanness to its uncleanness. Rabbi Akiva added and said: during all the days of the priests they did not refrain from lighting oil which had been rendered unclean by a tevul yom in a lamp which had been made unclean by one who had contracted corpse impurity, even though they add uncleanness to its uncleanness.","814":"Rabbi Meir said: from their words we learn that we may burn clean terumah together with unclean terumah on Pesah. Rabbi Yose said: that is not a proper analogy. And Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua agree that each is burnt separately. Concerning what do they disagree? In respect of doubtful terumah and unclean terumah: Rabbi Eliezer says: each is burnt separately But Rabbi Joshua rules: both together.","815":"Any hour in which one is permitted to eat chametz, one may feed it to cattle, beasts and birds, and one may sell it to a gentile, and benefit from it is permitted. When its time has passed benefit from it is forbidden, and he may not even fire an oven or a stove with it. Rabbi Judah says: there is no removal of chametz except by burning; But the sages say: he may also crumble it and throw it to the wind or cast it into the sea.","816":"Chametz which belongs to a gentile over which Pesach has passed is permitted for benefit; But that of an Israelite is forbidden for benefit, as it is said, \u201cNo leavened bread shall be found with you.\u201d","817":"If a gentile lent money to an Israelite on his chametz, after Pesah it is permitted for use. But if an Israelite lent money to a gentile on his chametz, after Pesah it is prohibited for use. If ruins fell on chametz it is as if it is has been removed. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: provided that a dog cannot search it out.","818":"One who unwittingly eats terumah chametz on Pesah must repay to a priest the principal plus a fifth. Intentionally, he is exempt from payment and from liability for its value as fuel.","819":"These are the things with which they fulfill their obligation on Pesah:  with wheat, with barley, with spelt, with rye, and with oats. And they fulfill the obligation with demai, with first tithe whose terumah has been separated, and with second tithe or sanctified property which have been redeemed; And priests can fulfill their obligation with hallah and terumah. But not with untithed produce, nor with first tithe whose terumah has not been separated, nor with second tithe or sanctified property which have not been redeemed. Loaves of the thanksgiving offering and the wafers of a nazirite: If he made them for himself, they cannot fulfill their obligation with them; If he made them to sell in the market, they can fulfill their obligation with them.","820":"And these are the herbs with which one discharges his obligation on Pesah:  with lettuce hazaret; with chicory olshin; with wild chicory tamkah; with picridium harhavina, and with sonchus maror. They fulfill their obligation whether they are moist or dry, but not preserved in vinegar, nor stewed nor boiled. And they combine to the size of an olive. And they fulfill their obligation with their stalks. And with demai, and with first tithe from which terumah has been separated, and second tithe and sacred property which have been redeemed.","821":"One may not soak bran for fowls, but one may scald it. A woman may not soak bran to take with her to the bathhouse, but she may rub dry bran on her skin . And a man may not chew wheat and place it on his wound, because it turns into chametz.","822":"One may not put flour into haroset or into mustard; And if he did put it, it must be eaten immediately; But Rabbi Meir forbids it. One may not boil the Pesah sacrifice, neither in liquids nor in fruit juice but one may baste and dip it in them. The water used by a baker must be poured out, because it causes leavening.","823":"These must be removed on Pesah:Babylonian kutah, Medean beer, Idumean vinegar, Egyptian zitom, The dyer\u2019s pulp, cook\u2019s dough, and the scribes\u2019 paste. Rabbi Eliezer says: women\u2019s ornaments too. This is the general rule: whatever is of a species of grain must be removed on Pesah. These are subject to a warning but they do not involve karet.","824":"With regard to the dough in the cracks of the kneading trough: if there is as much as an olive in one place, he must remove it; but if not, it is nullified through the smallness of its quantity. And it is likewise in the matter of uncleanness: if he objects to it, it makes a break; but if he desires its preservation, it is like the kneading-trough. With regard to \u201cdeaf\u201d dough, if there is a dough similar to it which has become chametz, it is forbidden.","825":"How do they separate hallah on the festival from dough which is in a state of uncleanness?Rabbi Eliezer says: she should not call it hallah until it is baked. Rabbi Judah ben Batera says: she should put the dough into cold water. Rabbi Joshua said:  this is not the chametz concerning which we are warned with, \u201cIt shall not be seen\u201d, and \u201cIt shall not be found\u201d.  Rather she separates it and leaves it until the evening, and if it ferments it ferments.","826":"Rabban Gamaliel says: three women may knead at the same time and bake in one oven, one after the other. But the sages say: three women may be engaged with the dough at the same time: one kneads, one shapes and one bakes. Rabbi Akiba says: not all women and not all kinds of wood and not all ovens are alike. This is the general principle: if it the dough rises, she should slap it with hands dipped in cold water.","827":"Si\u2019ur must be burnt, while he who eats it is exempt; sidduk must be burnt, while he who eats it is liable to kareth. What is si'ur? When there are lines on the surface like locusts\u2019 horns. Sidduk is when the cracks have intermingled with each other, the words of Rabbi Judah. But the sages say: regarding the one and the other, he who eats it is liable for karet. And what is si'ur? When its surface is blanched, like the face of a man whose hair is standing on end.","828":"If the fourteenth of Nisan falls on Shabbat, they remove everything before Shabbat, the words of Rabbi Meir. The sages say: at its usual time. Rabbi Eleazar bar Zadok says: terumah before Shabbat, and non-sacred chametz at its usual time.","829":"He who is on his way to slaughter his Pesah sacrifice or to circumcise his son or to dine at a betrothal feast at the house of his father-in-law, and remembers that he has chametz at home: if he is able to go back, remove it, and then return to his religious duty, he must go back and remove it; but if not, he annuls it in his heart. If he is on his way to save from an invasion or from a river or from brigands or from a fire or from a collapse of a building, he annuls it in his heart. But if to rest for pleasure, he must return immediately.","830":"Similarly, he who went out of Jerusalem and remembered that he had holy meat with him: If he has passed Scopus, he burns it where he is; but if not, he returns and burns it in front of the Temple with the wood of the altar pile. And for what quantity must they return? Rabbi Meir says: for both when there is as much as an egg; Rabbi Judah says: for both, when there is as much as an olive; But the sages say: holy meat, when there is as much as an olive and chametz, when there is as much as an egg.","831":"In a place where it is the custom to do work on the eve of Pesah until midday one may do work; where it is the custom not to do work, one may not do work. He who goes from a place where they work to a place where they do not work, or from a place where they do not work to a place where they do work, they place upon him the restrictions of the place from where he departed and the restrictions of the place to where he has gone. And a man must not act differently from local custom on account of the quarrels which would ensue.","832":"Similarly, he who transports sabbatical year produce from a place where it has ceased to exist in the field to a place where it has not ceased or from a place where it has not ceased to a place where it has ceased, he is bound to remove it. Rabbi Judah says:  he can say to them \u201cYou can go out too and bring produce for yourself.\u201d","833":"In a place where it is the custom to sell small domesticated animals to non-Jews, such sale is permitted; but where the custom is not to sell, such sale is not permitted. In no place however is it permitted to sell large animals, calves or foals, whether whole or maimed. Rabbi Judah permits in the case of a maimed one. And Ben Bateira permits in the case of a horse.","834":"In a place where it is the custom to eat roasted meat on the night of Pesah, they may eat it; where it is the custom not to eat it, they may not eat it. In a place where it is the practice to light a lamp at home on the night of Yom Kippur, they may light; where it is the practice not to light, they may not light. And they light lamps in synagogues, study-houses, and dark alleys, and for the sake of invalids.","835":"In a place where it is the custom to do work on the ninth of Av, one may do it; where it is the custom not to do work, one may not do it. And in all places students of sages desist from work on that day. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said: a man should always make himself a student of sages. But the sages say:  In Judea they used to do work on the eve of Pesah until midday, while in Galilee they did not work at all. With regard to the night:  Beth Shammai forbid work, but Bet Hillel permit it until sunrise.","836":"Rabbi Meir says: any work which he began before the fourteenth, he may finish it on the fourteenth; but he may not begin new work on the fourteenth, even if he can finish it on the same day. The sages say: three craftsmen may work on the eve of Pesah until midday, and these are they: tailors, hairdressers, and laundrymen. Rabbi Yose bar Judah says: shoemakers too.","837":"They may set up chicken-houses for fowls on the fourteenth; and if a fowl ran away, one may return her to her place; and if she died, one may set another in her place. They may sweep away the manure from under an animal\u2019s feet on the fourteenth, but on the festival one may only move it to the side. They may take vessels to and bring them back from a craftsman\u2019s house, even if they are not required for the festival.","838":"Six things the inhabitants of Jericho did: against three they the sages protested, and against three they did not protest.And these are those against which they did not protest: They grafted palm trees all day on the eve of Pesah; They \u2018wrapped up\u2019 the Shema; And they harvested and stacked their produce before the bringing of the \u2018omer. And for these they did not protest. And these are those against which they did protest: They permitted for use the small branches of sycamore trees belonging to sacred property, And they ate the fallen fruit from beneath trees on Shabbat, and they gave pe\u2019ah from vegetables; And for these they did protest.","839":"Six things King Hezekiah did, concerning three they the sages agreed with him, and concerning three they did not agree with him: He dragged his father's bones corpse on a rope bier, and they agreed with him; He crushed the bronze serpent, and they agreed with him; He hid the book of remedies, and they agreed with him. And concerning three they did not agree with him: He cut down the doors of the Temple and sent them to the king of Assyria, and they did not agree with him; He closed up the waters of the Upper Gihon, and they did not agree with him; He intercalated the month of Nisan in Nisan, and they did not agree with him.","840":"The afternoon tamid is slaughtered at eight and a half hours and is offered at nine and a half hours. On the eve of Pesah it is slaughtered at seven and a half hours and offered at eight and a half hours, whether it is a weekday or Shabbat. If the eve of Pesah fell on the eve of Shabbat it is slaughtered at six and a half hours and offered at seven and a half hours, and the pesah offering after it.","841":"A pesah sacrifice which a person slaughtered another purpose, or caught the blood or brought it or sprinkled its blood for another purpose; Or for its own purpose and for another purpose; or for another purpose and for its own purpose, it is disqualified. How is it \u201cfor its own purpose\u201d and then \u201cfor another purpose\u201d? For the purpose of being a pesah sacrifice first and then for the purpose of being a well-being offering. How is it \u201cfor another purpose\u201d and then \u201cfor its own purpose\u201d? For the purpose of being a well-being offering first and then for the purpose of being a pesah sacrifice.","842":"If he slaughtered it for those who cannot eat it or for those who are not registered for it, for uncircumcised persons or for unclean persons, it is unfit. If he slaughtered it for those who can eat it and for those who cannot eat it, for those who are registered for it and for those who are not registered for it, for circumcised and for uncircumcised persons, for unclean and for clean persons, it is fit. If he slaughtered it before midday, it is disqualified, because it is said, \u201cand all of the assembled congregation of Israelites shall slaughter it at twilight\u201d (Exodus 12:6). If he slaughtered it before the evening tamid, it is fit, providing that a person stirs its blood until that of the tamid is sprinkled. Nevertheless if it was sprinkled before the tamid, it is fit.","843":"One who slaughters the pesah with chametz in his possession violates a negative commandment. Rabbi Judah says: also the evening tamid. Rabbi Shimon says: If he slaughters the pesah with chametz on the fourteenth for its own purpose, he is liable; if for a different purpose, he is exempt. But for all other sacrifices, whether slaughtered for their own purpose or for a different purpose, he is exempt. If he slaughters the pesah with chametz on the festival for its own purpose, he is exempt; if for a different purpose, he is liable; But for all other sacrifices slaughtered on the festival with chametz, whether for their own purpose or for another purpose, he is liable, except in the case or a sin-offering which he slaughtered for a different purpose.","844":"The pesah is slaughtered in three divisions, as it is said, \u201cAnd the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it\u201d (Exodus 12:6):  \u201cassembly,\u201d \u201ccongregation,\u201d and \u201cIsrael.\u201d The first division entered, the Temple court was filled, and they closed the doors of the Temple court. They sounded a teki'ah, a teru'ah, and a teki'ah. The priests stood in rows, and in their hands were basins of silver and basins of gold, a row which was entirely of silver was of silver, and a row which was entirely of gold was of gold, they were not mixed. And the basins did not have flat bottoms, lest they put them down and the blood becomes congealed.","845":"The Israelite killed the lamb; And the priest caught the blood. He would hand it to his colleague and his colleague would hand it to his colleague.  And he would receive the full basin and give back the empty one.  The priest nearest the altar would sprinkle it once over against the base or the altar.","846":"The first division then went out and the second entered; the second went out and the third entered. As did the first, so did the second and the third. They recited the Hallel. If they finished it, they repeated, and if they repeated and were not finished yet, they recited it a third time, though they never did recite it a third time. Rabbi Judah says: the third division never reached, \u201cI love Lord for he hears\u201d (Psalms 116:1), because the people for it were few.","847":"As it was done on weekdays so it was done on Shabbat, except that the priests would mop up the Temple court, against the will of the sages. Rabbi Judah says:  he a priest would fill a goblet with the mixed blood and he sprinkled it once on the altar, but the sages did not agree with him.","848":"How did they hang up the sacrifices and flay them?There were iron hooks fixed in the walls and in the pillars, on which they hung up the sacrifices and flayed them. If any one had no place to suspend and flay their sacrifice, there were there thin smooth staves which he placed on his shoulder and on his fellow\u2019s shoulder, and so hung up the animal and flayed it. Rabbi Eliezer says: when the fourteenth fell on Shabbat, he placed his hand on his fellow\u2019s shoulder and his fellow\u2019s hand on his shoulder, and he hung up the sacrifice and flayed it.","849":"Then he tore it and took out its inner fats, placed them in a tray and burnt them on the altar. The first division went out and sat down on the Temple mount, the second sat in the hel, while the third remained in its place. When it grew dark they went out and roasted their pesah lambs.","850":"These things in connection with the pesah override Shabbat: its slaughtering and the sprinkling of its blood and the cleansing of its innards and the burning of its fat. But its roasting and the washing of its innards do not override Shabbat. Carrying it and bringing it from outside the Shabbat border and cutting off its wart do not override Shabbat. R. Eliezer says they do override Shabbat.","851":"Rabbi Eliezer said: is it not logical: if slaughtering, which is usually forbidden as a labor, overrides Shabbat, shouldn\u2019t these, which are only forbidden as mandated rest (shevut), override Shabbat? Rabbi Joshua said to him: let the festival prove this, for they permitted labor on the festival and forbade activities forbidden because of shevut. Rabbi Eliezer said to him: what is this, Joshua?  What proof is a voluntary act in respect of a commandment! Rabbi Akiva answered and said: let sprinkling purificatory waters prove it, which is performed because it is a commandment and is forbidden only as a shevut, yet it does not override Shabbat; so you too, do not wonder at these, that though they are required on account of a commandment and are forbidden only as shevut, yet they do not override Shabbat. Rabbi Eliezer said to him: but in respect of that I am arguing: if slaughtering, which is a labor, overrides Shabbat, is it not logical that sprinkling, which is only a shevut, should override Shabbat! Rabbi Akiva said to him: or the opposite: if sprinkling, which is forbidden as a shevut, does not override Shabbat, then slaughtering, which is normally forbidden on account of labor, is it not logical that it should not override Shabbat. Rabbi Eliezer said to him:  Akiva! You are uprooting what is written in the Torah, \u201cat twilight, offer it at its set time\u201d (Numbers 9:3), both on week-days and on Shabbat. He said to him: master, give me an appointed time for these as there is an appointed season for slaughtering! Rabbi Akiva stated a general rule: work which could be done on the eve of Shabbat does not override Shabbat; slaughtering, which could not be done on the eve of Shabbat, does override Shabbat.","852":"When does he bring a hagigah with it the pesah sacrifice? When it comes during the week, in purity, and in small amounts. But when it comes on Shabbat, in large amounts, and in impurity, one does not bring the hagigah with it.","853":"The hagigah was brought of flocks, herds, lambs or goats, of the males or the females. And it is eaten two days and one night.","854":"If the pesah was slaughtered for a different purpose on Shabbat, he the slaughterer is liable to a sin-offering on its account. All other sacrifices which he slaughtered as a pesah: if they are not fit to be a pesah he is liable; if they are fit to be a pesah: Rabbi Eliezer makes him liable to a sin-offering, But Rabbi Joshua exempts him. Rabbi Eliezer said to him: if for the pesah, which it is permitted to slaughter for its own purpose, yet when he changes its purpose he is liable; then other sacrifices, which are forbidden to slaughter even for their own purpose, if he changes their purpose is it not logical that he should be liable. Rabbi Joshua said to him:  not so. If you say with regard to the pesah, he is liable because he changed it to something that is forbidden; will you say the same of other sacrifices, where he changed them for something that is permitted? Rabbi Eliezer said to him: let the community sacrifices prove it, which are permitted for their own sake, yet he who slaughters other sacrifices in their name is liable. Rabbi Joshua said to him: not so. If you say with regard to the public sacrifices, that is because they have a limit; will you say the same of the pesah, which has no limit? Rabbi Meir says: he too who slaughters other sacrifices in the name of public sacrifice is not liable.","855":"If he slaughtered it for those who are not its eaters, or for those who were not registered for it, for uncircumcised or for unclean persons, he is liable. If he slaughtered it for its eaters and for those who are not its eaters, for those who are registered for it and for those who are not registered for it, for circumcised and for uncircumcised, for unclean and for clean persons, he is exempt. If he slaughtered it, and it was found to possess a blemish, he is liable. If he slaughtered it and it was found to be an internal terefah, he is exempt. If he slaughtered it, and then it became known that its owners had withdrawn their hands from it, or that they had died, or that they had become unclean, he is not culpable, because he slaughtered it with permission.","856":"How is the pesah roasted?They bring a spit of pomegranate wood and thrust it into its mouth right down as far as its buttocks, and place its legs and its entrails inside it, the words of Rabbi Yose the Galilean. Rabbi Akiva says: this is like boiling, rather they are hung outside it.","857":"One may not roast the pesah either on a metal spit or on a grill. Rabbi Zadok said: it once happened that Rabban Gamaliel said to his servant Tabi, \u201cGo out and roast us the pesah on the grill.\u201d If it the pesah touched the clay of the oven, he should pare its place. If some of its juice dripped on to the clay of the oven and dripped back on to it, he must remove its place. If some of its juice fell on the flour, he must take a handful away from its place.","858":"If he basted it the pesah with oil of terumah: If they who registered for it are a company of priests, they may eat it. But if Israelites, if it is still raw, they may wash it off; if it is roasted, he must pare the outer part. If he anointed it with oil of second tithe, he must not charge its value for the members of the company, because second tithe must not be redeemed in Jerusalem.","859":"Five things sacrifices may come in uncleanness, but may not be eaten in uncleanness:the omer, the two loaves, the showbread, the sacrifices of the public peace-offerings, and the goats of new months. The pesah which comes in uncleanness is also eaten in uncleanness, for from the very beginning it came for no other purpose but to be eaten.","860":"If the flesh was defiled while the fat remained clean, he may not sprinkle the blood but if the fat was defiled while the flesh has remained clean, he must sprinkle the blood. But in the case of other dedicated sacrifices it is not so, rather even if the flesh was defiled while the fat has remained clean, he must sprinkle the blood.","861":"If the community or the majority thereof was unclean, or if the priests were unclean and the community clean, they make the pesah sacrifice in uncleanness. If a minority of the community were unclean: those who are clean observe the first Pesah, while those who are unclean observe the second.","862":"A pesah whose blood has been sprinkled and then it became known that it was unclean, the frontlet propitiates. If the body of the owner became unclean, the frontlet does not propitiate, because they the sages said: in the case of a nazirite, and he who sacrifices the pesah-offering, the frontlet propitiates for the uncleanness of the blood, but the frontlet does not propitiate for the uncleanness of the body of the owner. If he was defiled with the uncleanness of the deep, the frontlet propitiates.","863":"If all or most of the pesah became unclean they burn it in front of the Birah with the wood of the pile. If a lesser part of it became unclean, and also \u201cremainder\u201d, they the people burn it in their courtyards or on their roofs with their own wood. Misers burn it in front of the Birah, in order to benefit from the wood of the pile.","864":"A pesah which went out beyond the walls of Jerusalem or was defiled must be burned immediately. If its owners were defiled or they died, its form must change and then it is burned on the sixteenth of Nisan. Rabbi Yohanan ben Berokah says: this too must be burned immediately, because there are none to eat it.","865":"The bones, and the sinews, and the \u201cremainder\u201d of the pesah are burned on the sixteenth. If the sixteenth falls on Shabbat, they are burned on the seventeenth, because they do not override either Shabbat or the festival.","866":"Everything which can be eaten of a full-grown ox may be eaten of a tender goat, as well as the tops of the forelegs and the cartilages. He who breaks a bone of a clean pesah receives forty lashes but he who leaves over flesh of a clean pesah or breaks a bone of an unclean one does not receive the forty lashes.","867":"If part of a limb went outside, he cuts the flesh as far as the bone and pares it until he reaches the joint and cuts it away. But in the case of other sanctified meat he cuts it off with a large knife, because they are not subject to the prohibition of breaking a bone. From the door-stop and within it is as the inside; From the door-stop and without is as outside. The windows and the thickness of the wall are as the inside.","868":"Two companies which are eating in one room, these turn their faces in one direction and eat and they turn their faces in another direction and eat, and the boiler is in the middle. When the servant rises to mix the wine, he must shut his mouth and turn his face away from the other company until he reaches his own company and there he eats. But a bride may turn her face away and eat.","869":"A wife, when she is in her husband\u2019s home, and her husband slaughtered on her behalf and her father slaughtered on her behalf, she must eat of her husband's. If she went to spend the first festival in her father's home, and her father slaughtered on her behalf and her husband slaughtered on her behalf, she may eat wherever she pleases. An orphan on whose behalf his guardians slaughtered may eat wherever he pleases. A slave of two partners may not eat of either. He who is half slave and half free may not eat of his master's.","870":"One who says to his slave, \u201cGo out and slaughter the pesah on my behalf\u201d, if he slaughtered a kid, he may eat it; if he slaughtered a lamb, he may eat it; if he slaughtered a kid and a lamb, he eats the first. If he forgot what his master told him, how should he act? He should slaughter a lamb and a kid and declare, \u201cIf my master told me to slaughter a kid, the kid is his and the lamb is mine; and if my master told me to slaughter a lamb, the lamb is his and the kid is mine.\u201d If his master also forgot what he told him, both animals go to the place of burning, but they the master and the slave are exempt from sacrificing the second pesah.","871":"If a man says to his children, \u201cBehold, I am going to slaughter the pesah on behalf of whichever of you goes up first to Jerusalem,\u201d as soon as the first has put his head and the greater part of his body into Jerusalem he has acquired his portion, and he acquires it on behalf of his brothers with him. One may always register for it as long as there is as much as an olive\u2019s worth for each one registered. They may register and withdraw their hands from it until it has been slaughtered; Rabbi Shimon says: until the blood is sprinkled.","872":"If one registers others with him to share in his portion, the members of the company are permitted to give him his portion, and he eats his and they eat theirs.","873":"If a zav saw two instances of discharge, they slaughter the pesah on his behalf on his seventh day. If he saw three instances of discharge, they slaughter on his behalf on his eighth day. If a woman observes a \u201cday for a day\u201d, they slaughter on her behalf on her second day. If she saw a discharge on two days, they slaughter on her behalf on the third day. And as for a zavah, they slaughter on her behalf on the eighth day.","874":"As to an onen, and one who is removing a heap of stones, and likewise one whom they promised to take out of prison, and a sick or an old person who can eat as much as an olive, they slaughter on their behalf. Yet in the case of all these, they may not slaughter for them alone, lest they bring the pesah to disqualification. Therefore if a disqualification occurs to them, they are exempt from keeping the second pesah, except for one who was removing the heap, because he was unclean from the beginning.","875":"They may not slaughter the pesah for a single person, the words of Rabbi Judah. But Rabbi Yose permits it. And even a company of a hundred who cannot eat as much as an olive, one may not slaughter a pesah for them. And one may not form a company of women and slaves and minors.","876":"An onen immerses in a mikveh and eats his pesah in the evening, but not other sacred food. One who hears about his dead for the first time, and one who gathers the bones of his dead relative immerses and eats sacred food. A convert who converts on the eve of Pesah: Bet Shammai say:  he immerses and eats his pesah in the evening. Bet Hillel say:  anyone who separates from the foreskin is like one who separates from the grave.","877":"He who was unclean or on a far-off journey and did not keep the first Pesah must keep the second. If he unwittingly erred or was prevented and did not keep the first, he must keep the second. If so, why does it say \u201can unclean person\u201d and \u201cone who was one a long journey\u201d specified? That these are not liable to karet, whereas these are liable to karet.","878":"What is \u201ca far-off journey\u201d?From Modi\u2019im and beyond, and the same distance on all sides of Jerusalem, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Eliezer says: from the threshold of the Temple court and beyond. Rabbi Yose said to him: for that reason the heh has a dot on it in order to say, not because it is really far-off, but even when one is from the threshold of the Temple court and beyond.","879":"What is the difference between the first Pesah and the second?The first is subject to the prohibition of chametz shall not be seen and chametz shall not be found, while at the second matzah and chametz are in the house with him. The first requires the reciting of Hallel when it is eaten, while the second does not require Hallel when it is eaten. But both require the reciting of Hallel when they are sacrificed, and they are eaten roasted with matzah and bitter herbs, and they override Shabbat.","880":"The pesah which comes in impurity: zavin and zavot, menstruant women and women after childbirth do not eat from it, yet if they did eat they are exempt from karet. Rabbi Eliezer exempts them even of the karet normally incurred for entering the sanctuary.","881":"What is the difference between the pesah which was offered in Egypt and the pesah of subsequent generations?The pesah in Egypt was taken on the tenth of Nisan, And it required sprinkling with a bunch of hyssop on the lintel and on the two door-posts, And it was eaten in haste on one night, whereas the pesah of subsequent generations is kept the whole seven days.","882":"Rabbi Joshua said: I have heard that the substitute of a pesah is sacrificed, and that the substitute of a pesah is not sacrificed, and I cannot explain. Rabbi Akiva said:  I will explain: The pesah which was found before the slaughtering of the pesah must be left to graze until it becomes unfit, and then it may be sold, and one brings a peace-offering with the money; and the same applies to its substitute. If found after the slaughtering of the pesah, it is offered as a wellbeing offering, and the same applies to it substitute.","883":"If a man sets aside a female for his pesah or a two-year old male, it should be left to graze until it becomes unfit, then it should be sold, and its money is spent on a voluntary sacrifice. If a man separates his pesah and dies, his son after him should not bring it as a pesah but rather as a wellbeing offering.","884":"If a pesah became mixed up with other sacrifices, they all graze until they become unfit through a blemish, then they are sold, and then he must bring a replacement for the price of the best of this type, and bring for the price of the best of this type and he loses the remainder from his own pocket. If it became mixed up with first-borns:  Rabbi Shimon says: if the pesah belonged to a company of priests, they eat all of the animals that night.","885":"A company lost their pesah and they said to one who was registered with them, \u201cGo and seek it, and slaughter it on our behalf\u201d; and he went, found, and slaughtered it, and they also took an animal and slaughtered it: If his was slaughtered first, he eats of his and they eat with him. And if theirs was first slaughtered, they eat of theirs, while he eats of his. And if it is unknown which of them was first slaughtered, or if they slaughtered both of them at the same time, he eats of his, but they may not eat with him; while theirs goes forth to the place of burning, and they are exempt from keeping the second Pesah. He said to them, \u201cIf I delay, go forth and slaughter on my behalf,\u2019, and then he went and found it and slaughtered it, while they took another and slaughtered it: If theirs was slaughtered first, they eat of theirs while he eats with them; And if his was slaughtered first, he eats of his and they eat of theirs. And if it is unknown which of them was slaughtered first, or if they slaughtered both of them at the same time, they eat of theirs, but he may not eat with them, while his goes forth to the place of burning, and he is exempt from keeping the second Pesah. He said to them, and they said to him:  they all eat of the first to be slaughtered, and if it is unknown which of them was slaughtered first, both go forth to the place of burning. If he did not say to them and they did not say to him, they are not responsible for each other.","886":"Two companies whose pesah sacrifices became mixed up: these take possession of one animal and these take possession of one. One member of these joins those, and one member of those joins these, and thus they declare: if this pesah is ours, your hands are withdrawn from your own and you are registered for ours; while if this pesah is yours, our hands are withdrawn from ours and we are registered for yours. Similarly, if there are five companies consisting of five members each or of ten each, they draw one from each company and say thusly.","887":"If the pesah sacrifices belonging to two individuals became mixed up, each takes possession of one animal; This one registers someone from the marketplace with him and that one registers someone from the marketplace with him. This one goes over to that one and that one goes over to this one, and thus  they declare: \u201cIf this pesah is mine, your hands are withdrawn from yours and you are registered for mine; while if this pesah is yours, my hands are withdrawn from mine and I am registered for yours.\u201d","888":"On the eve of Pesah close to minhah one may not eat until nightfall. Even the poorest person in Israel must not eat on the night of Pesah until he reclines. And they should give him not less than four cups of wine, and even from the charity plate.","889":"They mixed him the first cup: Bet Shammai says:  first he blesses over the day and then over the wine. Bet Hillel says:  first he blesses over the wine and then over the day.","890":"They bring it in front of him. He dips lettuce before until he reaches the appetizer that precedes the bread. They bring before him matzah, lettuce, and haroset though the haroset is not mandatory. Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Zadok says: it is mandatory. And in the Temple they bring the body of the pesah before him.","891":"They mixed him a second cup, and here the son questions his father. If the son lacks the intelligence to ask, his father instructs him: How different this night is from all other nights! On all other nights we eat hametz and matzah, tonight only matzah. On all other nights we eat other vegetables, tonight only bitter herbs. On all other nights, we eat meat roasted, boiled or cooked, tonight only roasted. On all other nights we dip once, tonight twice. And according to the intellect of the son, the father instructs him. He begins with shame and concludes with praise; and expounds from \u201cA wandering Aramean was my father\u201d until he completes the whole section.","892":"Rabban Gamaliel used to say: whoever does not make mention of these three things on Pesah does not fulfill his duty. And these are they: the pesah, matzah, and bitter herbs. The pesah because the Omnipresent passed over the houses of our fathers in Egypt. The matzah because our fathers were redeemed from Egypt. The bitter herb because the Egyptians embittered the lives of our fathers in Egypt. In every generation a man is obligated to regard himself as though he personally had gone forth from Egypt, because it is said, \u201cAnd you shall tell your son on that day, saying: \u2018It is because of that which the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt\u201d (Exodus 13:8). Therefore it is our duty to thank, praise, laud, glorify, raise up, beautify, bless, extol, and adore Him who made all these miracles for our fathers and ourselves; He brought us forth from slavery into freedom, from sorrow into joy, from mourning into festivity, from darkness into great light, and from servitude into redemption. Let us say before him, Hallelujah!","893":"How far does one recite it? Bet Shammai say: Until \u201cAs a joyous mother of children\u201d (Psalms 113:9). But Bet Hillel say: Until \u201cThe flinty rock into a fountain of waters\u201d (Psalms 114:8). And he concludes with a formula of redemption. Rabbi Tarfon says: \u201cWho redeemed us and redeemed our fathers from Egypt\u201d, but he did not conclude with a blessing. Rabbi Akiva says: \u201cSo may the Lord our God and the God of our fathers bring us to other appointed times and festivals which come towards us for peace, rejoicing in the rebuilding of Your city and glad in Your service, and there we will eat of the sacrifices and the pesahim\u201d etc. until \u201cBlessed are You who has redeemed Israel.\u201d","894":"They poured him a third cup, blesses over his meal. A fourth cup, he concludes the Hallel, and recites over it the blessing of song. Between these cups if he wants he may drink; between the third and the fourth he may not drink.","895":"One may not conclude the pesah meal with an afikoman. If some of them fell asleep, they may eat the pesah when they wake up. If all of them fell asleep they may not eat. Rabbi Jose says: if they napped, they may eat, but if they fell asleep, they may not eat.","896":"The pesah defiles one\u2019s hands after midnight. Piggul and remnant defile one\u2019s hands. If he recited the blessing for the pesah, he thereby exempts the sacrifice the hagigah; but if he recited the blessing for the sacrifice the hagigah, he does not exempt the pesah, the words of Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: this does not exempt that nor does that exempt this.","897":"There are four new years:The first of Nisan is the new year for kings and for festivals. The first of Elul is the new year for the tithe of beasts. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say:  the first of Tishri. The first of Tishri is the new year for years, for shmitta and jubilee years, for planting and for tithe of vegetables. The first of Shevat is the new year for trees, according to the words of Bet Shammai. Bet Hillel says:  on the fifteenth of that month.","898":"At four set times the world is judged:On Pesah in respect to the produce. On Shavuot in respect to the fruit of the tree. On Rosh Hashanah all the people of the world pass before Him like a division of soldier a numerus, as it says, \u201cHe who fashions the hearts of them all, who discerns all their doings\u201d (Psalms 33:15). And on Sukkot they are judged in respect of rain.","899":"There are six months at the beginning of which messengers go out.On Nisan because of Pesah; On Av because of the fast. On Elul because of Rosh Hashanah. On Tishri because of the setting of the festivals. On Kislev because of Hanukah. And on Adar because of Purim. When the Temple stood, they used also to go out to report Iyar because of Pesah Katan (Pesah Sheni).","900":"On account of two months they profane Shabbat: on account of Nissan and Tishri, for on those months messengers go forth to Syria and in them the dates of the festivals are fixed. When the Temple stood they used to profane Shabbat for all the months, in order that the sacrifice might be offered on the right day.","901":"Whether the new moon was seen clearly or was not seen clearly, they profane Shabbat on account of it. Rabbi Yose says:  if it was been seen clearly they do not profane Shabbat on account of it.","902":"It happened that more than forty pairs of witnesses were on their way to Jerusalem and Rabbi Akiva detained them in Lod. Rabban Gamaliel sent to him saying: if you prevent the multitude from coming to provide testimony it will turn out that you cause them to stumble in the future.","903":"If a father and a son have seen the new moon, they should both go to Jerusalem, not that they can join together as witnesses but so that if one of them is disqualified the other may join with another witness. Rabbi Shimon says that a father and son and all relatives are eligible to testify to the appearance of the new moon. Rabbi Yose said: it happened once that Tobias the doctor saw the new moon in Jerusalem along with his son and his freed slave. The priests accepted his evidence and that of his son and disqualified his slave. But when they appeared before the court they accepted his evidence and that of his slave and disqualified his son.","904":"And these are they which are not qualified to be witnesses or judges: A dice player, a usurer, pigeon racers, or traffickers in Seventh Year produce, and slaves. This is the general rule:  any testimony for which a woman is not qualified, they too are not qualified.","905":"If one who has seen the new moon and is not able to walk to Jerusalem on foot, he may be brought on a donkey or even in a litter on Shabbat. If they the witnesses are likely to be attacked, they may take sticks to defend themselves. If the distance is great to Jerusalem, they may take provisions with them, since for as much as a night and a day\u2019s journey they were allowed to profane Shabbat and go out to testify concerning the new moon, as it says:  \u201cThese are the appointed times of the Lord \u2026 which you shall proclaim at their appointed time\u201d (Leviticus 23:4).","906":"If they don\u2019t know him the one who came to testify, they send another with him to testify concerning his reliability. Originally testimony concerning the new moon was accepted from anyone. When the minim disrupted this, it was decreed that testimony should be received only from persons known to the court.","907":"Originally they used to light torches to signal that the new month had been decreed. When the Samaritans disrupted this, they decreed that messengers should go out.","908":"How did they light the torches? They used to bring long poles of cedar and reeds and olive wood and flax fluff and they tied them all together with a string. And someone used to go up to the top of a mountain and light them with fire and wave them back and forth and up and down until he saw the next one doing the same thing on the top of the second mountain; and so on the top of the third mountain.","909":"At what places did they light the torches? From the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem to Sartaba, and from Sartaba to Gripina, and from Gripina to Havran, and from Havran to Bet Biltin. From Bet Biltin they did not move, but rather waved the torch back and forth and up and down until he saw the whole of the diaspora before him lit up like one bonfire.","910":"There was a large courtyard in Jerusalem, and it was called Bet Yazek. There all the witnesses used to assemble and the court would examine them there. They would make large feasts for them there so that they would have an incentive to come. Originally they used not to leave the place the whole day, but Rabban Gamaliel decreed that they could go two thousand cubits from it in any direction. And these were not the only ones who could go two thousand cubits in any direction, but also a midwife who has come to deliver a child, or one who comes to rescue from a fire or from bandits or from a river in flood or from a building that has fallen in   all these are like residents of the town, and may go two thousand cubits on Shabbat in any direction.","911":"How do they test the witnesses?The pair which arrives first, they test them first. They bring in the older of them and they say to him, \u201cTell us, how did you see the moon   in front of the sun or behind the sun?  To the north of it or to the south? How high was it, and in which direction was it inclined?  And how broad was it?\u201d If he says he saw it in front of the sun, his evidence is rejected. After that they would bring in the second and test him. If their accounts were the same, their evidence was accepted. And the other pairs were only questioned briefly, not because they were required at all, but so that they should not go out disappointed, so that they would be regular in coming to testify.","912":"The head of the court says, \u201cSanctified,\u201d and all the people answer after him, \u201cSanctified, sanctified.\u201d Whether the new moon is seen at its proper time or not at its proper time they sanctify it. Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says that if it is not seen as its proper time they do not sanctify it for heaven has already sanctified it.","913":"Rabban Gamaliel had diagrams of the moon on a tablet hung on the wall of his upper chamber, and he used to show them to the unlearned and say, \u201cDid it look like this or this?\u201d It happened that two witnesses came and said, \u201cWe saw it in the morning in the east and in the evening in the west.\u201d Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said:  they are lying witnesses. When they came to Yavneh Rabban Gamaliel accepted them. On another occasion two witnesses came and said, \u201cWe saw it at its proper time, but on the night which should have been the new moon it was not seen,\u201d and Rabban Gamaliel accepted their evidence. Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas said: they are lying witnesses. How can they testify that a woman has given birth when on the next day her belly is between her teeth (swollen)? Rabbi Joshua to him: I see your argument.","914":"Rabban Gamaliel sent to him: I order you to appear before me with your staff and your money on the day which according to your count should be Yom Hakippurim. Rabbi Akiva went and found him in distress. He said to him: I can teach that whatever Rabban Gamaliel has done is valid, because it says, \u201cThese are the appointed seasons of the Lord, holy convocations, which you shall proclaim at their appointed times\u201d (Leviticus 23:4), whether they are proclaimed at their proper time or not at their proper time, I have no other appointed times save these. He Rabbi Joshua then went to Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas. He said to him: if we call in question the court of Rabban Gamaliel we must call in question the decisions of every court which has existed since the days of Moses until now. As it says, \u201cThen Moses and Aaron, Nadav and Avihu and seventy of the elders of Israel went up\u201d (Exodus 24:9).  Why were the names of the elders not mentioned?  To teach that every group of three which has acted as a court over Israel, behold it is like the court of Moses. He Rabbi Joshua took his staff and his money and went to Yavneh to Rabban Gamaliel on the day which according to his count should be Yom Hakippurim. Rabban Gamaliel rose and kissed him on his head and said to him: Come in peace, my teacher and my student   my teacher in wisdom and my student because you have accepted my decision.","915":"If the court and all of Israel saw it, if the witnesses were examined and there was no time left to say \u201cSanctified\u201d before it grew dark, then the month is impregnated (it has thirty days). If the court alone saw it, two of them should stand up and testify before them, and then they can say, \u201cSanctified, sanctified.\u201d If three people saw it, and they themselves are the court, two of them should stand up and they should seat some of their colleagues with the one remaining judge, and they the two should testify before them and they can then say, \u201cSanctified, sanctified.\u201d For an individual is not trusted to sanctify the new month by himself.","916":"All shofars may be used except for that of a cow, because it is a keren. Rabbi Yose said: Are not all shofars called keren as it says, \u201cWhen they make a long blast with the ram\u2019s keren horn?\u201d (Joshua 6:5).","917":"The shofar used on Rosh Hashanah was that of an ibex, straight, and its mouth was overlaid with gold. There were two trumpets, one on each side of it. The shofar gave a long blast and the trumpets a short one, since the commandment of the day was with the shofar.","918":"On public fast days they used shofars of rams, curved, the mouths of which were covered with silver, and there were two trumpets in between them. A short blast was made with the shofars and a long one with the trumpets, because the mitzvah of the day is with trumpets.","919":"The Jubilee is the same as Rosh Hashanah when it comes to blowing the shofar and blessings. Rabbi Judah says: on Rosh Hashanah they blow with a shofar of rams and on Jubilees with a shofar of ibex.","920":"A shofar which has split and then he stuck it together is not valid. If he stuck together fragments of shofars, it is not valid. If there was a hole in a shofar and he closed it up, if it interferes with the blowing it is not valid, but if it does not it is valid.","921":"One who blows into a pit or a cistern or a jug, if he heard the sound of the shofar, he has fulfilled his obligation, but if he hears the echo also, he has not fulfilled his obligation. And also one who was passing behind a synagogue or if his house was next to the synagogue and he heard the sound of the shofar or of the megillah being read, if he directed his heart (had intention), then he has fulfilled his obligation, but if not he has not fulfilled his obligation. Even though this one heard and this one heard, this one directed his heart and this one did not.","922":"\u201cAnd it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand Israel prevailed\u201d etc. (Exodus 17:1.  Did the hands of Moses wage war or break Israel\u2019s ability to wage war? Rather this teaches that as long as Israel would look upwards and subject their hearts to their Father in heaven they prevailed, and if not they fell. Similarly, \u201cMake for yourself a fiery serpent and mount it on a pole.  And if anyone who is bitten shall look at it, he shall live\u201d (Numbers 21:8).  Did the serpent kill or did the serpent keep alive? Rather, when Israel would look upwards and subject their hearts to their Father in heaven, they were healed, and if not their flesh would melt away. A deaf-mute, a lunatic and a minor cannot cause others to fulfill their religious obligation. This is the general principle: one who is not himself obligated in the matter cannot perform it on behalf of others.","923":"If Yom Tov of Rosh Hashanah fell on Shabbat, they would blow the shofar in the Temple but not in the country. After the destruction of the Temple, Rabban Yohanan ben Zakai decreed that it should be blown on Shabbat in every place where there was a court. Rabbi Eliezer said: Rabban Yohanan ben Zakai decreed for Yavneh only. They said to him: both Yavneh and any place where there is a court.","924":"There was another way in which Jerusalem was greater than Yavneh, that in every city which could see Jerusalem and hear and was near and could get to Jerusalem, they used to blow on Shabbat, whereas in Yavneh they used to blow in the court only.","925":"In earlier times the lulav was taken for seven days in the Temple, and in the provinces for one day only. When the temple was destroyed, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai decreed that the lulav should be taken in the provinces for seven days in memory of the Temple, He also decreed that on the whole of the day of waving it be forbidden to eat the new produce.","926":"Originally they used to accept testimony with regard to the new moon during the whole day. On one occasion the witnesses were late in arriving, and the Levites went wrong in the daily hymn. They therefore decreed that testimony should be accepted only until the afternoon sacrifice. If witnesses came after the afternoon sacrifice that day should be kept as holy and also the next day. After the destruction of the temple Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai decreed that testimony with regard to the new moon should be received during the whole day. Rabbi Joshua ben Korha said: this further did Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai decree, that not matter where the head of the court might be, the witnesses should have to go only to the place of the assembly.","927":"The order of blessings in the Musaf Amidah of Rosh Hashanah:He says \u201cpatriarchs\u201d, \u201cpowers\u201d and the \u201csanctification of the name\u201d and includes the kingship verses with them and does not blow the shofar. The sanctification of the day and blows the shofar, the remembrance-verses and blows the shofar, and the shofar-verses and blows the shofar.  Then he says the blessing of the Temple service and \u201cthanksgiving\u201d and the blessing of the priests, the words of Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri. Rabbi Akiva said to him: if he does not blow the shofar for the kingship-verses, why should he say them? Rather he says:  \u201cpatriarchs\u201d, \u201cpowers\u201d and the \u201csanctification of the name\u201d and includes the kingship verse with the sanctification of the day and blows the shofar, then he says the remembrance-verses and blows, and the shofar-verses and blows. Then he says the Temple service and \u201cthanksgiving\u201d and the blessing of the priest.","928":"They do not recite less than ten kingship verses, ten remembrance verses, and ten shofar verses. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: if he said three from each set he has fulfilled his obligation. They do not mention kingship, remembrance and shofar verses of punishment. He begins with verses from the Torah and concludes with verses from the prophets. Rabbi Yose says: if he concludes with a verse from the Torah he has fulfilled his obligation.","929":"The one who passes before the ark on the festival of Rosh Hashanah: the second one blows the shofar. On days when Hallel is said, the first one recites the Hallel.","930":"For the sake of the shofar of Rosh Hashanah one is not allowed to go past the Shabbat border, nor remove a pile of rocks, nor climb a tree, nor ride on an animal, nor swim on the water. One may not cut it, neither with an instrument forbidden because of shevut, nor with an instrument forbidden by a negative commandment. But if he wants to pour wine or water into it he may do so. They need not prevent children from blowing the shofar on Rosh Hashanah; on the contrary, they may help them until they learn how to blow. One who is just practicing has not fulfilled his obligation, and the one hears the blast made by another when practicing has not fulfilled his obligation.","931":"The order of the blasts:  three sets of three each. The length of a teki\u2019ah is equal to three teru'ahs, and the length of a teru'ah is equal to three yevavot. If one prolonged the first teki'ah so that it went directly into the second, it counts only as one. One who has blessed recited the Amidah and then a shofar is given to him, he sounds a teki'ah teru'ah teki'ah three times. Just as the shaliah tzibbur is obligated, so every single individual is obligated. Rabban Gamaliel says:  the shaliah tzibbur causes the whole congregation to fulfill their obligation.","932":"The acts of <b>carrying out<\/b> from a public domain into a private domain or vice versa, which are prohibited <b>on Shabbat,<\/b> are primarily <b>two<\/b> basic actions <b>that comprise four<\/b> cases from the perspective of a person <b>inside<\/b> a private domain, <b>and two<\/b> basic actions <b>that comprise four<\/b> cases from the perspective of a person <b>outside,<\/b> in a public domain. The mishna elaborates: <b>How<\/b> do these eight cases take place? In order to answer that question, the mishna cites cases involving a poor person and a homeowner. <b>The poor<\/b> person <b>stands outside,<\/b> in the public domain, <b>and the homeowner stands inside,<\/b> in the private domain. <b>The poor person<\/b> lifted an object in the public domain, <b>extended his hand into<\/b> the private domain, <b>and placed<\/b> the object <b>into the hand of the homeowner.<\/b> In that case, the poor person performed the prohibited labor of carrying from the public domain into the private domain in its entirety. <b>Or,<\/b> the poor person reached his hand into the private domain, <b>took<\/b> an item from the hand of the homeowner, <b>and carried<\/b> it <b>out<\/b> into the public domain.

In both of these cases, because <b>the poor person<\/b> performed the prohibited labor in its entirety, he <b>is liable and the homeowner is exempt.<\/b> The mishna cites two additional cases. In these, the prohibited labor is performed by the homeowner, who is in the private domain: <b>The homeowner<\/b> lifted an item in the private domain, <b>extended his hand into<\/b> the public domain, <b>and placed<\/b> the object <b>into the hand of the poor person.<\/b> In that case, the homeowner performed the labor of carrying out from the private domain into the public domain in its entirety. <b>Or,<\/b> the homeowner reached his hand into the public domain, <b>took<\/b> an object <b>from<\/b> the hand of the poor person, <b>and carried<\/b> it <b>into<\/b> the private domain.

In those cases and the two that follow, the act of transferring the object from one domain to another was performed jointly by two people, the poor person and the homeowner. Because each performed only part of the prohibited labor, <b>both of them are exempt.<\/b> So too, in a case where <b>the homeowner extended his hand into the public domain and,<\/b> either <b>the poor person took<\/b> an object <b>from<\/b> the homeowner\u2019s hand and placed it in the public domain <b>or the poor person placed<\/b> an object <b>into<\/b> the homeowner\u2019s hand and the homeowner <b>carried<\/b> the object <b>into<\/b> the private domain. Because each performed only part of the prohibited labor, <b>both of them are exempt.<\/b>","933":"After having dealt with the limited and defined topic of the <i>halakhot<\/i> of carrying out on Shabbat, the mishna begins to deal with the <i>halakhot<\/i> of Shabbat chronologically, beginning with activities that one may not perform prior to the onset of Shabbat. With regard to one\u2019s daily conduct, the mishna says: <b>A person may not sit before the barber adjacent to<\/b> the time of <b><i>min\u1e25a<\/i> until he recites<\/b> the afternoon <b>prayer. And a person may not enter the bathhouse and may not<\/b> enter <b>to<\/b> work in <b>a tannery<\/b> <b><i>burseki<\/i><\/b>. <b>And<\/b> he may <b>neither<\/b> begin <b>to eat<\/b> a meal <b>nor to<\/b> sit in <b>judgment<\/b> until he prays. <b>And<\/b> however, <b>if they<\/b> already <b>began<\/b> engaging in those activities, <b>they need not stop<\/b> and recite the <i>Amida<\/i> prayer. The <i>tanna<\/i> articulated a principle: <b>One stops<\/b> engaging in all of these activities <b>to recite <i>Shema<\/i> and one does not stop to<\/b> recite the <i>Amida<\/i> <b>prayer.<\/b>","934":"This mishna deals with various decrees, especially with regard to the <i>halakhot<\/i> of Shabbat, which were issued in order to distance a person from transgressions that he is liable to commit through habit and routine. The mishna said: <b>The tailor may not go out<\/b> with <b>his needle adjacent to nightfall<\/b> on Shabbat eve, <b>lest he forget<\/b> that he is carrying the needle <b>and go out<\/b> with it to the public domain even after Shabbat begins. <b>And,<\/b> similarly, <b>the scribe<\/b> <b><i>lavlar<\/i><\/b> may <b>not<\/b> go out <b>with his quill<\/b><b><i>kulmos<\/i><\/b> for the same reason. <b>And<\/b> one <b>may not shake his clothes<\/b> on Shabbat to rid them of lice; <b>and<\/b> one <b>may not read<\/b> a book <b>by candlelight,<\/b> so that he will not come to adjust the wick of the lamp. However, <b>in truth they said<\/b> an established <i>halakha<\/i>: The <b>attendant sees where<\/b> in the book the <b>children<\/b> under his supervision are <b>reading<\/b> in the Torah, even by candlelight on Shabbat. <b>However, he<\/b> himself <b>may not read. Similarly,<\/b> the Sages issued a similar decree with regard to other <i>halakhot<\/i>, as they said: <b>The <i>zav<\/i> may not eat<\/b> even <b>with<\/b> his wife <b>the <i>zava,<\/i><\/b> despite the fact that they are both ritually impure, <b>because,<\/b> by eating together, they will come to excessive intimacy and become <b>accustomed to sin.<\/b>","935":"<b>And these are among the <i>halakhot<\/i> that<\/b> the Sages, <b>who went up to visit him, said in the upper story of \u1e24ananya ben \u1e24izkiya ben Garon.<\/b> The precise nature of these <i>halakhot<\/i> will be explained in the Gemara. These <i>halakhot<\/i> are considered one unit because they share a distinctive element. Since many Sages were there, among them most of the generation\u2019s Torah scholars in Eretz Yisrael, they engaged in discussion of various <i>halakhot<\/i> of the Torah. It turned out that when the people expressing opinions <b>were counted,<\/b> the students of <b>Beit Shammai outnumbered<\/b> the students of <b>Beit Hillel, and they issued decrees<\/b> with regard to <b>eighteen matters on that day<\/b> in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai.","936":"In this mishna there is a fundamental dispute between Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai: Must one begin refraining from actions prohibited on Shabbat on Shabbat eve? Or, may one initiate an action prior to Shabbat, even if he knows that it will continue on its own on Shabbat itself? These are the details of that dispute: <b>Beit Shammai say: One may only soak<\/b> dry <b>ink<\/b> in water <b>and<\/b> dry plants, which produce <b>dyes,<\/b> in water <b>and vetch<\/b> for animal food to soften them in water on Shabbat eve, adjacent to Shabbat,<b>if<\/b> there is clearly <b>sufficient time for them to soak<\/b> for their designated purpose <b>while it is still day,<\/b> before Shabbat begins, and their continued soaking on Shabbat will have no effect. <b>And Beit Hillel permit<\/b> doing so.","937":"<b>Beit Shammai say: One may only place bundles of<\/b> combed <b>flax inside the oven<\/b> on Shabbat eve if there is sufficient time <b>so that they will be heated while it is still day.

","940":"<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: The<\/b> ancestral <b>house of<\/b> my <b>father,<\/b> the dynasty of <i>Nesi\u2019im<\/i> from the house of Hillel, <b>was accustomed to give<\/b> its <b>white clothes to a gentile launderer<\/b> no fewer than <b>three days before Shabbat. And,<\/b> however, <b>these,<\/b> Beit Shammai, <b>and those,<\/b> Beit Hillel, <b>agree that,<\/b> <i>ab initio<\/i>, <b>one may load the beam of the olive press<\/b> on the olives on Shabbat eve while it is still day, so that the oil will continue to be squeezed out of the olives on Shabbat. So too, one may load the <b>circular wine press<\/b> to accelerate the process of producing wine from the grapes.","941":"This mishna enumerates actions that may only be performed on Shabbat eve if the prohibited labor will be totally or mostly completed while it is still day. <b>One may only roast meat, an onion, or an egg if<\/b> there remains <b>sufficient<\/b> time <b>so that they could be roasted while it is still day. One may only place<\/b> dough to bake into <b>bread in the oven<\/b> on Shabbat eve <b>at nightfall, and<\/b> may only place <b>a cake on the coals, if<\/b> there is time <b>enough that<\/b> the <b>surface<\/b> of this cake or bread <b>will form a crust while it is still day. Rabbi Eliezer says:<\/b> Enough time so <b>that its bottom<\/b> crust <b>should harden,<\/b> which takes less time.","942":"However in a case that is an exception, <b>one may,<\/b> <i>ab initio<\/i>, <b>lower the Paschal lamb<\/b> into the oven on Shabbat eve <b>at nightfall,<\/b> so that its roasting is completed on Shabbat if Passover eve coincides with Shabbat eve. <b>And one may,<\/b> <i>ab initio<\/i>, <b>kindle the fire in the bonfire of the Chamber of the Hearth<\/b> in the Temple on Shabbat eve, adjacent to the start of Shabbat, and allow the fire to spread afterward throughout all the wood in the bonfire. <b>And,<\/b> however, <b>in the outlying areas,<\/b> meaning in all of Eretz Yisrael outside the Temple, it is prohibited to light a bonfire on Shabbat eve, unless there is sufficient <b>time for the fire to take hold in most of<\/b> the bonfire, while it is still day. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: With<\/b> a bonfire of <b>coals,<\/b> even in the outlying areas one is permitted to light the fire on Shabbat eve at nightfall, even if the fire only spread to <b>any amount<\/b> of the bonfire. The coals, once they are kindled, will not be extinguished again, and there is no concern lest he come to tend to them on Shabbat.","943":"This mishna cites a list of fuels and wicks that one may not use in kindling the Shabbat lights, either because their use might induce one to perform a prohibited labor on Shabbat or because they are not in keeping with the deference due Shabbat. The mishna begins by listing the materials that one may not use as wicks. That is followed by a list of the substances that one may not use as fuel.<br><br><b>With what may one light<\/b> the Shabbat lamp, <b>and with what may one not light<\/b> it? With regard to types of prohibited wicks, one may light <b>neither with cedar bast <i>lekhesh<\/i>, nor with uncombed flax <i>\u1e25osen<\/i>, nor with raw silk <i>kalakh<\/i>, nor with willow bast <i>petilat ha<\/i>\u2019<i>idan<\/i>, nor with desert weed <i>petilat hamidbar<\/i>, nor with green<\/b> moss <b>that is on<\/b> the <b>surface of the water.<\/b> With regard to types of prohibited oils, one may light <b>neither with pitch <i>zefet<\/i>, nor with wax <i>sha<\/i>\u2019<i>ava<\/i>, nor with castor oil <i>shemen kik<\/i>, nor with burnt oil <i>shemen sereifa<\/i>, nor with<\/b> fat from <b>a sheep\u2019s tail <i>alya<\/i>, nor with tallow <i>\u1e25elev<\/i>.

And the Rabbis say: Both<\/b> tallow that was <b>boiled and<\/b> tallow that was <b>not boiled, one may not light with them.<\/b>","944":"In continuation of the previous mishna, this mishna adds that <b>one may not light with burnt oil on a Festival,<\/b> as the Gemara will explain below. With regard to lighting Shabbat lamps, there were Sages who prohibited the use of specific oils. <b>Rabbi Yishmael says<\/b> that <b>one may not light with tar <i>itran<\/i> in deference to Shabbat<\/b> because tar smells bad and disturbs those in the house. <b>And the Rabbis permit<\/b> lighting <b>with all oils<\/b> for lamps as long as they burn properly; <b>with sesame oil, with nut oil, with turnip oil, with fish oil, with gourd oil, with tar, and<\/b> even <b>with naphtha <i>neft<\/i>. Rabbi Tarfon says: One may light only with olive oil<\/b> in deference to Shabbat, as it is the choicest and most pleasant of the oils.","945":"Of <b>all<\/b> substances <b>that emerge from the tree, one may light only with flax<\/b> on Shabbat because the other substances do not burn well. <b>And<\/b> of <b>all<\/b> substances <b>that emerge from the tree, the only<\/b> substance <b>that becomes ritually impure<\/b> with impurity transmitted by <b>tents<\/b> over a corpse <b>is flax.<\/b> If there is a dead body inside a house or a tent that is made from any materials that originate from a tree, everything in the house becomes ritually impure. However, only in the case of flax does the tent itself become impure. <b>The wick of a garment,<\/b> i.e., cloth made into a wick for a lamp, <b>that one folded it<\/b> into a size and shape suitable for a wick, <b>but did not<\/b> yet <b>singe it<\/b> slightly in order to facilitate its lighting, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:<\/b> This wick is <b>ritually impure.<\/b> With regard to the laws of ritual impurity, it can, like other garments, still become ritually impure <b>and one may not light with it<\/b> on Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: It is ritually pure and one may<\/b> even <b>light with it<\/b> on Shabbat.","946":"The fundamental dispute in this mishna is with regard to the determination whether or not indirect acts of kindling and extinguishing fall within the parameters of the prohibition on Shabbat. The Rabbis said: <b>A person may not pierce<\/b> a hole in <b>an eggshell and fill it with oil, and place it over<\/b> the mouth of <b>a lamp so that<\/b> the egg <b>will drip<\/b> additional oil into the lamp and thereby extend the time that it burns. <b>And<\/b> this is the ruling <b>even<\/b> if <b>it is<\/b> not an actual egg but an <b>earthenware<\/b> vessel. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda permits<\/b> doing so. <b>However, if the craftsman,<\/b> who crafts ceramic vessels, <b>attached<\/b> the egg to the lamp <b>from the outset, one is permitted<\/b> to fill it with oil <b>because it<\/b> constitutes <b>a single,<\/b> large <b>vessel.<\/b> The Rabbis decreed that <b>a person may not fill a bowl with oil, and place it beside the lamp, and place the<\/b> unlit <b>head of the wick into<\/b> the bowl <b>so that it draws<\/b> additional oil from the bowl and thereby extend the time that the lamp burns. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda permits<\/b> doing so.","947":"<b>One who extinguishes the lamp<\/b> on Shabbat <b>because he is afraid due to gentiles,<\/b> from whom he is hiding in his home, <b>and due to thieves,<\/b> or if one is afraid <b>due to an evil spirit,<\/b> i.e., he is depressed and prefers sitting in the dark, or if he extinguished the flame <b>due to the sick person<\/b> so that he <b>will sleep,<\/b> he is <b>exempt.<\/b> However, in a case where he extinguishes the flame in order to <b>spare the lamp, spare the oil, or spare the wick,<\/b> he is <b>liable. Rabbi Yosei exempts<\/b> him <b>in all of<\/b> those cases, as in his opinion no labor prohibited by Torah law is being performed by extinguishing the flame, <b>except for<\/b> the case where he seeks to spare <b>the wick.<\/b> Only in that case is extinguishing a creative action <b>because he makes<\/b> the wick into <b>charcoal<\/b> by extinguishing the flame.","948":"This mishna concludes the aggadic treatment of the topic of kindling the Shabbat lights. <b>For three transgressions women<\/b> are punished and <b>die during childbirth: For<\/b> the fact <b>that they are not careful in<\/b> observing the laws of <b>a menstruating woman,<\/b> and <b>in<\/b> separating <b><i>\u1e25alla<\/i><\/b> from the dough, <b>and in lighting<\/b> the Shabbat <b>lamp.<\/b>","949":"There are <b>three things a person must say in his home on Shabbat eve at nightfall<\/b> and not before. The mishna elaborates: He should ask the members of his household, <b>have you tithed<\/b> the crop that required tithing? <b>Have you placed the <i>eiruv<\/i><\/b> for joining the courtyards and joining the Shabbat borders? If you have done so, <b>light the lamp<\/b> in honor of Shabbat. The Sages stated a principle: If the time arrives on Friday when there is <b>uncertainty<\/b> whether it is <b>nightfall<\/b> and <b>uncertainty<\/b> whether it is <b>not<\/b> yet <b>nightfall, one may not tithe<\/b> the crop that has <b>definitely<\/b> not been tithed, <b>and one may not immerse<\/b> ritually impure <b>vessels<\/b> in a ritual bath to render them ritually pure, <b>and one may not light the<\/b> Shabbat <b>lights. However, one may tithe <i>demai<\/i>,<\/b> doubtfully tithed produce, which must be tithed due to mere suspicion. <b>And one may place an <i>eiruv<\/i> and insulate the hot water<\/b> to be used on Shabbat.","950":"With regard to <b>a stove that was lit<\/b> on Shabbat eve <b>with straw<\/b> or <b>with rakings,<\/b> scraps collected from the field, one may <b>place<\/b> a pot of <b>cooked food atop it<\/b> on Shabbat. The fire in this stove was certainly extinguished while it was still day, as both straw and rakings are materials that burn quickly. However, if the stove was lit <b>with pomace,<\/b> pulp that remains from sesame seeds, olives, and the like after the oil is squeezed from them, <b>and<\/b> if it was lit <b>with wood,<\/b> one may <b>not place<\/b> a pot atop it on Shabbat <b>until he sweeps<\/b> the coals from the stove while it is still day <b>or until he places ashes<\/b> on the coals, so that the fire will not ignite on Shabbat. <b>Beit Shammai say:<\/b> Even after one has swept away the coals, it is only permitted to place <b>hot water<\/b> on it, as it is sufficiently hot and does not require additional cooking, <b>but not cooked food.<\/b> Since, in general, one prefers that food will cook more, there is concern lest he come to ignite the fire by stoking the coals. <b>And Beit Hillel say:<\/b> Both <b>hot water and cooked food<\/b> may be placed. <b>Beit Shammai say: One may remove<\/b> a pot from the stove on Shabbat <b>but<\/b> may <b>not return<\/b> it. <b>And Beit Hillel say:<\/b> One may <b>even return it.<\/b>","951":"The <i>halakhot<\/i> that were stated with regard to a stove were specific to a stove\u2019s unique structure and the manner in which it retains heat. However, with regard to other baking apparatuses, i.e., an oven or a <i>kupa\u1e25,<\/i> there are different rules. The mishna delineates: <b>An oven that they lit<\/b> even <b>with straw<\/b> or <b>rakings, one may neither place<\/b> a pot <b>inside it nor atop it<\/b> on Shabbat. Whereas a <b><i>kupa\u1e25<\/i> that was lit with straw<\/b> or <b>rakings, its<\/b> legal status is <b>like<\/b> that of <b>a stove,<\/b> and one is permitted to place a pot atop it on Shabbat. If it were lit <b>with pomace<\/b> or <b>with wood, its<\/b> legal status is <b>like<\/b> that of <b>an oven<\/b> and it is prohibited to place a pot atop it on Shabbat.","952":"In addition to the <i>halakhot<\/i> that deal with cooking on the fire on Shabbat, several related <i>halakhot<\/i> are discussed. The mishna says: <b>One may not place a<\/b> raw <b>egg next to an urn<\/b> full of hot water <b>so that it will roast slightly. And one may not<\/b> even <b>wrap it in cloths,<\/b> i.e., one may not heat the egg inside cloths that were heated in the sun. <b>And Rabbi Yosei permits<\/b> doing so in that case. <b>And,<\/b> similarly, <b>one may not insulate it in sand<\/b> or <b>in road dust<\/b> that was heated in the sun <b>so that it will roast.<\/b> Although there is no actual cooking with fire here, it is similar to cooking and the Sages issued a decree to prohibit doing so.","953":"The mishna relates <b>a story about the people of<\/b> the city of <b>Tiberias, and they ran a cold-water pipe <i>silon<\/i> through a canal of hot<\/b> water from the Tiberias hot springs. They thought that by doing so, they could heat the cold potable water on Shabbat. <b>The Rabbis said to them: If<\/b> the water passed through <b>on Shabbat,<\/b> its legal status is <b>like<\/b> that of <b>hot water that was heated on Shabbat, and<\/b> the water is <b>prohibited<\/b> both <b>for bathing and for drinking. And if<\/b> the water passed through <b>on a Festival, then it is prohibited<\/b> for <b>bathing but permitted for drinking.<\/b> On Festivals, one is even permitted to boil water on actual fire for the purposes of eating and drinking. In this mishna, the Sages discuss two vessels used for heating water. With regard to <b>a <i>mulyar<\/i>,<\/b> a bronze vessel into which coals are placed in an outer compartment and water is placed into an adjacent inner compartment, whose coals were <b>swept, one may drink from it on Shabbat.<\/b> With regard to <b>an <i>antikhi<\/i>,<\/b> which is a vessel with a different configuration, <b>even if<\/b> its coals were <b>swept, one may not drink from it<\/b> on Shabbat.","954":"The Sages added to the laws of leaving food on a source of heat and cooking food on Shabbat: <b>An urn that was emptied<\/b> of its hot water on Shabbat, <b>one may not place cold water into it so that<\/b> the cold water <b>will be heated. However, one may place<\/b> cold water <b>into<\/b> an urn <b>or into a cup<\/b> that were emptied of their hot water <b>in order to warm it<\/b> but not in order to heat it. In continuation of the discussion of vessels where the prohibition of cooking applies even though the vessels are not actually on the fire itself, the mishna establishes: <b>A stew pot <i>ilpas<\/i> and a pot that were removed<\/b> from the fire while they were still <b>boiling,<\/b> even if they were removed before Shabbat, <b>one may not place spices into them<\/b> on Shabbat itself. Even though the pot is not actually standing on the fire, the spices are still cooked in it because the pot is a primary vessel, i.e., a vessel whose contents were cooked on the fire. <b>However, one may place<\/b> the spices <b>into a bowl or into a tureen <i>tam\u1e25ui<\/i>,<\/b> which is a large bowl into which people pour the contents a stew pot or a pot. Bowls and tureens are both secondary vessels and food placed into them does not get cooked. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may place<\/b> spices <b>into anything<\/b> on Shabbat <b>except for<\/b> a vessel that has in it <b>something containing vinegar<\/b> or <b>brine<\/b> of salted fish.","955":"From a discussion of the <i>halakhot<\/i> of insulation and preparation for Shabbat followed by a brief tangent dealing with the prohibited labor of cooking on Shabbat, the mishna proceeds to briefly discuss prohibitions relating to set-aside <i>muktze<\/i> items in terms of Shabbat lamps. <b>One may not place a vessel beneath the<\/b> oil <b>lamp,<\/b> the vessel containing the oil and the wick, on Shabbat in order <b>to receive the oil<\/b> that drips from the wick. <b>And if one placed<\/b> the vessel on Friday <b>while it was still day, it is permitted. However,<\/b> in any case, <b>one may not make use of<\/b> the oil on Shabbat <b>because it is not from the<\/b> oil <b>prepared<\/b> from Shabbat eve for use on Shabbat. The oil in the lamp was already set aside and designated solely for the purpose of lighting the lamp. The dispute in this mishna seems to be a local one; however, it is the key to several <i>halakhot<\/i> in the area of the prohibition of set-aside <i>muktze<\/i>. <b>One may move a new<\/b> oil <b>lamp<\/b> on Shabbat <b>but not<\/b> an <b>old<\/b> one that was already used. A lamp that was used is covered with soot and unsuitable for use. It is therefore considered set aside from use due to its disgusting nature. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: All<\/b> oil <b>lamps may be moved<\/b> on Shabbat <b>except for an<\/b> oil <b>lamp<\/b> that is <b>burning on Shabbat,<\/b> due to the concern that it might be extinguished. <b>One may place a vessel beneath the<\/b> oil <b>lamp<\/b> in order <b>to receive<\/b> burning <b>sparks<\/b> of oil that fall from the lamp so that they will not cause a fire. <b>And he may not place water into<\/b> the vessel <b>because he<\/b> thereby <b>extinguishes<\/b> the sparks. When a pot is removed from the fire on Shabbat eve it may be insulated in materials that preserve its heat, but not in materials that increase its heat. Raising the temperature of a pot is tantamount to cooking. ","956":"The <i>mishnayot<\/i> that follow list those materials in which such a pot may be insulated on Shabbat eve and those materials in which it may not be insulated.<br><br><b>In what may one insulate<\/b> a pot of cooked food on Shabbat eve, <b>and in what may one not insulate<\/b> it?<b> One may neither insulate<\/b> it <b>in the solid residue<\/b> of produce that has been pressed free of its oil, <b>nor in manure, nor in salt, nor in lime, nor in sand, whether<\/b> those materials are <b>moist<\/b> or <b>whether<\/b> they are <b>dry.<\/b> All of these materials spontaneously generate heat when piled for an extended period.

Because the semen remains fit for insemination, it can transmit impurity, <b>as it is stated<\/b> prior to the revelation at Sinai: \u201cAnd he said to the people, <b>prepare yourselves for three days,<\/b> do not approach a woman\u201d (Exodus 19:15). This three-day separation period ensured that even a woman who discharged semen would be pure. The mishna cites another <i>halakha<\/i> based on a biblical allusion: <b>From where<\/b> is it derived <b>that one may wash the circumcision on the third day,<\/b> meaning the third day after the circumcision, even if <b>it occurs on Shabbat?

The pain of circumcision lasts at least three days, and as long as the child is in pain he is considered to be in danger.

Rabbi Eliezer\u2019s approach was not universally accepted, and <b>a principle was stated by Rabbi Akiva: Any prohibited labor that can be performed on Shabbat eve does not override Shabbat,<\/b> including transporting the circumcision scalpel. However, any prohibited labor involved in the mitzva of <b>circumcision<\/b> itself <b>that cannot be performed on Shabbat eve overrides Shabbat.<\/b>","1042":"When the eighth day of a baby\u2019s life occurs on Shabbat, he must be circumcised on that day. Therefore, <b>one performs all the necessities of<\/b> the <b>circumcision,<\/b> even <b>on Shabbat: One circumcises<\/b> the foreskin, <b>and uncovers<\/b> the skin by removing the thin membrane beneath the foreskin, <b>and sucks<\/b> the blood from the wound, <b>and places on it<\/b> both <b>a bandage <i>ispelanit<\/i> and cumin<\/b> as a salve. <b>If one did not grind<\/b> the cumin <b>from Shabbat eve, he chews<\/b> it <b>with his teeth and places<\/b> it on the place of circumcision as a salve. <b>If he did not mix wine and oil on Shabbat eve,<\/b> a mixture designed to heal and strengthen the child, <b>this,<\/b> the wine, <b>is placed<\/b> on the wound <b>by itself and that,<\/b> the oil, is placed <b>by itself.<\/b> <b>And<\/b> on Shabbat <b>one may not make a pouch<\/b> to place over the circumcision as a bandage <b><i>ab initio<\/i>, but he may wrap a rag over it<\/b> as a dressing. <b>If he did not prepare<\/b> the bandage <b>on Shabbat eve<\/b> by bringing it to the place where the circumcision was performed, <b>he wraps<\/b> the bandage <b>on his finger and brings<\/b> it on Shabbat, <b>even from a different courtyard.<\/b> While the Sages permitted it to be brought, they required that it be performed in an unusual fashion, by wearing it in the manner of a garment.","1043":"<b>One may wash the baby<\/b> on Shabbat, <b>both before the circumcision and after the circumcision. And one may sprinkle<\/b> hot water <b>on him by hand but not with a vessel,<\/b> in order to depart from the usual manner in which this is done. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: One may wash the baby on the third day<\/b> following his circumcision, even if <b>that<\/b> third day <b>occurs on Shabbat.<\/b> On the third day following circumcision, the baby is considered to be in danger, <b>as it is stated<\/b> with regard to the men of Shekhem, who were circumcised: <b>\u201cAnd it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain\u201d<\/b> (Genesis 34:25).

And one may add water to bran<\/b> used as animal feed, <b>but one may not knead<\/b> the mixture. <b>And one may not place water before bees or before doves in a dove-cote,<\/b> because they are capable of finding their own food; <b>however, one may place<\/b> water <b>before geese and chickens and before hardisian <i>hardeisiyyot<\/i> doves.<\/b>","1069":"<b>One may cut the pumpkins before an animal<\/b> on Shabbat, as long as they were picked prior to Shabbat. <b>And<\/b> likewise one may cut <b>an<\/b> animal <b>carcass before the dogs<\/b> on Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If it was not<\/b> already <b>a carcass,<\/b> i.e., it was not dead, <b>prior to Shabbat, it is prohibited<\/b> to cut it or even move it on Shabbat <b>because it is not prepared<\/b> for use on Shabbat.","1070":"A father or husband <b>may nullify<\/b> his daughter\u2019s or his wife\u2019s <b>vows on Shabbat, and one may request<\/b> from a Sage <b>to<\/b> dissolve <b>vows that are for the purpose of Shabbat.<\/b> Failure to dissolve the vow will compromise one\u2019s fulfillment of the mitzva to delight in Shabbat. <b>And one may seal a window<\/b> on Shabbat to prevent light from entering, <b>and one may measure a rag<\/b> to determine whether or not it is large enough to contract ritual impurity, <b>and one may measure a ritual bath<\/b> to determine if it contains enough water for immersion. The mishna relates that there was <b>an incident in the time of Rabbi Tzadok\u2019s father and the time of Abba Shaul ben Botnit,<\/b> in which they <b>sealed a window using an earthenware vessel and tied an earthenware shard with a<\/b> long <b>reed-grass<\/b> with a temporary knot, in order <b>to ascertain whether or not the roofing had an opening<\/b> the size of <b>a handbreadth. And from their statements<\/b> and their actions, <b>we derived that one may seal<\/b> a window, <b>and measure, and tie<\/b> a knot <b>on Shabbat.<\/b>","1071":"On the first of Adar they make a public announcement about the shekels and concerning kilayim. On the fifteenth: they read the Megillah Esther in walled cities, and they fix the roads and the streets and the ritual water baths, and they perform all public duties, and they mark the graves, and messengers go forth also concerning kilayim.","1072":"Rabbi Judah said: at first they used to uproot the kilayim, and throw them down before them. But when transgressors increased in number, they used to uproot them and throw them on the roads. Finally, they decreed that they should make the whole field ownerless.","1073":"On the fifteenth of Adar they would set up tables of money changers in the provinces. On the twenty-fifth they set them up in the Temple. When the tables were set up in the Temple, they began to exact pledges from those who had not paid. From whom did they exact pledges? From Levites and Israelites, converts and freed slaves, but not women or slaves or minors. Any minor on whose behalf his father has begun to pay the shekel, may not discontinue it again. But they did not exact pledges from the priests, because of the ways of peace.","1074":"Rabbi Judah said: Ben Bukri testified at Yavneh that a priest who paid the shekel is not a sinner. But Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai said to him: not so, but rather a priest who did not pay the shekel was guilty of a sin, only the priests expounded this verse for their own benefit: \u201cAnd every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt, it shall not be eaten\u201d (Leviticus 6:16), since the omer and the two loaves and the showbread are brought from our contributions, how can they be eaten?","1075":"Even though they said, \u201cthey don\u2019t exact pledges from women, slaves or minors, yet if they paid the shekel it is accepted from them. If a non-Jew or a Samaritan paid the shekel they do not accept it from them. And they do not accept from them the bird-offerings of zavin or bird-offerings of zavot or bird-offerings of women after childbirth, Or sin-offerings or guilt-offerings. But vow-offerings and freewill-offerings they do accept from them. This is the general rule: all offerings which can be made as a vow-offering or a freewill-offering they do accept from them, but offerings which cannot be made as a vow-offering or a freewill-offering they do not accept from them. And thus it is explicitly stated by Ezra, as it is said: \u201cYou have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God\u201d (Ezra 4:3).","1076":"The following are liable to pay the kalbon (surcharge): Levites and Israelites and converts and freed slaves; but not priests or women or slaves or minors. If a man paid the shekel on behalf of a priest, or on behalf of a woman, or on behalf of a slave, or on behalf of a minor, he is exempt. If a man paid the shekel on his own behalf and on behalf of his fellow he is liable for one kalbon. Rabbi Meir says: two kalbons. If one gave a sela and received a shekel, he is liable to pay two kalbons.","1077":"If one paid the shekel on behalf of a poor man or on behalf of his neighbor or on behalf of his fellow-townsman, he is exempt from the kalbon. But if he loaned it to them he is liable. Brothers who are partners who are obligated for the kalbon are exempt from the tithe of beasts. But when they are liable to the tithe of beasts they are exempt from the surcharge. And how much is the kalbon? A silver ma'ah, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: half a ma'ah.","1078":"They may change shekels into darics because of the load of the journey. Just as there were shofar-shaped chests in the Temple so there were shofar-shaped chests in the provinces. The townspeople who had sent their shekels and they were stolen or lost: If the appropriation had already been made the messengers swear an oath to the treasurers; But if the appropriation had not yet been made they swear to the townspeople, and the townspeople must pay new shekels in the place of the lost shekels. If the lost shekels were found, or if the thieves restored them, then both the first shekels and their substitutes are sacred shekels and they cannot be credited to the account of the coming year.","1079":"One who gave his shekel to his fellow to pay it on his behalf, but his fellow paid it on behalf of himself: if the appropriation had already been made his fellow is guilty of sacrilege. One who paid his shekel out of money belonging to the sanctuary: If the appropriation had already been made and an animal bought out of the appropriation had already been offered, he is guilty of sacrilege. If he paid his shekel with money that had been used to redeem the second tithe or the value of seventh year produce, he must eat food equal to its value.","1080":"One who gathered some coins and said: \u201cBehold, these are for my shekel.\u201d Bet Shammai say: the surplus is used to purchase freewill-offerings. But Bet Hillel say: the surplus is non-sacral property. If he said: \u201cFrom them I shall bring my shekel,\u201d they agree that the surplus is non-sacral property. If he said: \u201cThese coins are for a sin-offering, they agree that the surplus goes to the chests of freewill-offerings. If he said: \u201cFrom these I shall bring a sin-offering, they agree that the surplus is non-sacral property.","1081":"Rabbi Shimon says: what is the difference between shekels and a sin-offering?   Shekels have a fixed value, but a sin-offering has no fixed value. Rabbi Judah says: shekels also have no fixed value. For when the Israelites came up out of the diaspora they used to pay the shekel in darics, then they paid the shekel in selas, then they paid it in tibs, and finally they wanted to pay it in dinars. But Rabbi Shimon said: nevertheless they are all of the same value for everyone, whereas in the case of a sin-offering one man may bring it of the value of one sela, another may bring it of the value of two selas, and another in the value of three selas.","1082":"The surplus of money set aside for shekels is non-sacred property. The surplus of money set aside for the tenth of the ephah, and the surplus of money set aside for bird-offerings of zavim, for bird-offerings of zavot, for bird-offerings of women after childbirth, and sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, their surplus is used to purchase freewill-offerings. This is the general rule: all money set aside for a sin-offering or for a guilt-offering, the surplus is used to purchase freewill-offerings. The surplus of money set aside for a burnt-offering must be used for a burnt-offering. The surplus of money set aside for a meal-offering must be used for a meal-offering. The surplus of money set aside for a peace-offering must be used for a peace-offering. The surplus of money set aside for a pesach must be used for a wellbeing offering. The surplus of money set aside for the offerings of nazirites must be used for the offerings of other nazirites. The surplus of money set aside for the offerings of a particular nazirite is used to purchase freewill-offerings. The surplus of money raised for the poor must be used for other poor. The surplus of money raised for a particular poor person must be given to that poor person. The surplus of money raised for the ransom of captives must be used for the ransom of other captives. The surplus of money raised for the ransom of a particular captive must be given to that captive. The surplus of the money raised for the burial of the dead must be used for the burial of other dead. The surplus of the money raised for the burial of a particular dead person must be given to his heirs. Rabbi Meir says: the surplus of money raised for the burial of a particular dead person must be laid aside until Elijah comes. Rabbi Natan says: the surplus of money raised for the burial of a particular dead person must be used for building a monument for him over his grave.","1083":"At three periods of the year the appropriation is made from the shekels in the chamber:  Half a month before Pesah, half a month before Shavuot, and half a month before Sukkot, and these are also the threshing floors the seasons for the tithe of beasts, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Ben Azzai says: on the twenty-ninth of Adar, and on the first of Sivan, and on the twenty-ninth of Av. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: on the first of Nisan, on the first of Sivan, and on the twenty-ninth of Elul. Why did they say, \u201cOn the twenty-ninth of Elul and not on the first of Tishre? Because the first of Tishre is a holy day, and it is not permitted to tithe on a festival, therefore they moved it up to the twenty-ninth of Elul.","1084":"In three baskets each of the capacity of three seahs they make the appropriation of shekels from the chamber. And on them was inscribed:  Aleph, Beth, Gimmel. Rabbi Ishmael says: Greek was inscribed on them, alpha, beta, gamla. The one who made the appropriation did not enter the chamber wearing either a bordered cloak or shoes or sandals or tefillin or an amulet, lest if he became poor people might say that he became poor because of a sin committed in the chamber, or if he became rich people might say that he became rich from the appropriation in the chamber. For it is one\u2019s duty to seem be free of blame before others as before God, as it is said: \u201cAnd you shall be guiltless before the Lord and before Israel\u201d (Numbers 32:22), and it says: \u201cAnd you will find favor and good understanding in the eyes of God and man\u201d (Proverbs 3:4).","1085":"The members of Rabban Gamaliel\u2019s household used to enter the chamber with their shekel between their fingers, and throw it in front of him who made the appropriation, while he who made the appropriation purposely pressed it into the basket. He who made the appropriation did not make it until he first said to them:  \u201cShould I make the appropriation?\u201d And they say to him three times:  \u201cMake the appropriation! Make the appropriation! Make the appropriation!\u201d","1086":"After he made the first appropriation, he covers what is left with leather covers. After he made the second appropriation, he covers what is left with leather covers. But after the third appropriation he would not cover what was left. And why would he cover?  Lest he should forget and make a fresh appropriation from shekels from which had already been appropriated. He would make the first appropriation on behalf of the Land of Israel, and the second on behalf of the surrounding cities, and the third on behalf of Babylon and on behalf of Medea and on behalf of other distant countries.","1087":"What did they do with the appropriation? They bring with it the daily burnt-offerings and the additional burnt-offerings and their libations, the omer and the two loaves and the showbread and all the other public offerings. Those who guard the aftergrowths of the seventh year take their wages out of the appropriation from the chamber. Rabbi Yose says: if a man wished he could volunteer to watch without payment. But they said to him: you too admit that they can only be offered out of public funds.","1088":"The red heifer and the scapegoat and the strip of scarlet came out of the appropriation of the chamber. The ramp for the red heifer and the ramp for the scapegoat and the strip of scarlet which was between its horns, and the maintenance of the pool of water and the wall of the city and its towers and all the needs of the city came out of the remainder in the chamber. Abba Shaul says: the ramp for the red cow the high priests made out of their own means.","1089":"What did they do with the surplus of the remainder in the chamber?They would buy with it wines, oils and fine flours, and the profit belonged to the Temple, the words of Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: one may not make a profit with the property of the Temple, nor with the property of the poor.","1090":"What was done with the surplus of the appropriation?They would buy plates of gold for covering the interior of the Holy of Holies. Rabbi Ishmael says: the surplus from the sale of the produce was used for the altar\u2019s \u2018dessert\u2019, and the surplus of the appropriation was used for the ministering vessels. Rabbi Akiba says: the surplus of the appropriation was used for the altar\u2019s \u2018dessert\u2019, and the surplus of the libations was used for the ministering vessels. Rabbi Hananiah the chief of the priests says: the surplus of the libations was used for the altar\u2019s \u2018dessert\u2019, and the surplus of the appropriation was used for the ministering vessels. Neither of these two sages allowed a profit from the sale of the produce.","1091":"What was done with the surplus of the incense?They would separate from it the wages of the craftsmen, and they would exchange it for the wages of the craftsmen, and they would give it to the craftsmen as their wages, and then they would buy it back again out of a new appropriation. If the new month had arrived in time they would bring it with the new appropriation, but if not, they from the old one.","1092":"If one dedicated his possessions to the Temple, and there was among them things which was fit for public offerings, they should be given to the craftsmen as their wages; the words of Rabbi Akiva. Ben Azzai said to him: this method is not correct. Rather, they separate from them the wages of the craftsmen, and then they exchange them for the money due to the craftsmen, and then they give them to the craftsmen as their wages, and then they buy them back again out of a new appropriation.","1093":"One who dedicated his possessions to the Temple and there was among them an animal fit for the altar, males or females,Rabbi Eliezer says: males should be sold for the use of burnt-offerings and females   should be sold for the use of offerings of wellbeing, and the proceeds should be lumped together with the rest of the possessions for the repair of the temple. Rabbi Joshua says: the males themselves should be offered as burnt-offerings and the females should be sold for the use of offerings of wellbeing, and with the proceeds burnt offerings should be brought, and the other possessions should go to the repair of the temple. Rabbi Akiva says: I prefer the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer over the opinion of Rabbi Joshua, for Rabbi Eliezer applied a uniform rule, but Rabbi Joshua differentiated. Rabbi Papias said: I have heard a tradition in accordance with both of their opinions: that one who dedicates to the Temple with explicitness, it is according to the words of Rabbi Eliezer, but one who dedicates to the Temple without specifying it is according to the opinion of Rabbi Joshua.","1094":"One who dedicated his possessions to the Temple and there were among them things fit for the altar, such as wines, oils, and birds: Rabbi Elazar says: they should be sold for the use of offerings of each particular kind, and they should bring with the proceeds burnt offerings, and the other possessions should go to the repair of the Temple.","1095":"Once in thirty days prices were fixed on behalf of the chamber. Anyone who had accepted upon himself to supply fine flours at four se'ahs for a sela and they now stood at three se'ahs for a sela he must still supply four. If he had accepted to supply fine flours at three se'ahs for a sela and they now stood at four, he must also supply at four, for the sanctified property has the upper hand. If the fine flour became worm-eaten the loss is his; if the wine became sour the loss is his. For he is not entitled to his money until the altar has accepted the offering.","1096":"These were the officers in the Temple:Yohanan the son of Pinchas was over the seals. Ahiyah over the libations. Mattityah the son of Shmuel over the lots. Petahiah over the bird-offering.  (Petahiah was Mordecai. Why was his name called Petahiah? Because he \u2018opened\u2019 matters and expounded them, and he understood the seventy tongues). The son of Ahijah over the sickness of the bowels. Nehuniah, the digger of ditches. Gevini, the crier. The son of Gever over the locking of the gates. The son of Bevai over the strips for lighting the menorah. The son of Arza over the cymbal. Hugras the son of Levi over the song. The house of Garmu over the making of the showbread. The house of Avtinas over the preparing of the frankincense. Elazar over the curtains. And Pinchas over the priestly vestments.","1097":"They did not have less than three treasurers. Or less than seven superintendents. Nor create positions of authority over the public in matters of money with less than two officers, except in the case of the son of Ahiyah who was over the sickness of the bowels and Elazar who was over the veil, for these had been accepted by the majority of the public.","1098":"There were four seals in the Temple, and on them was inscribed respectively: \u2018calf\u2019, \u2018ram\u2019, \u2018kid\u2019, \u2018sinner\u2019. Ben Azzai says: there were five and on them was inscribed in Aramaic respectively\u201d \u2018calf\u2019, \u2018ram\u2019, \u2018kid\u2019, \u2018poor sinner\u2019, and \u2018rich sinner\u2019. The seal inscribed \u2018calf\u2019 served for the libations of cattle, both large and small, male and female. The seal inscribed \u2018kid\u2019 served for the libations of flock animals, both large and small, male and female, with the exception of rams. The one inscribed \u2018ram\u2019 served for the libations of rams alone. The one inscribed \u2018sinner\u2019 served for the libations of the three animals offered by lepers.","1099":"If one required libations he would go to Yohanan who was the officer over the seals, and give him money and receive from him a seal. Then he would go to Ahiyah who was the officer over the libations, and give him the seal, and receive from him the libations. And in the evening these two officers would come together, and Ahiyah would bring out the seals and receive money for their value. And if there was more than their value the surplus belonged to the sanctuary, but if there was less than their value Yohanan would pay the loss out of his own pocket; for the Temple has the upper hand.","1100":"If one lost his seal his case they wait to deal with him until the evening. If they found money left over to the value of his lost seal, they give it to him and if not he gets nothing. On the seals was inscribed the name of the day because of the defrauders.","1101":"There were two chambers in the Temple, one the chamber of secret gifts and the other the chamber of the vessels. The chamber of secret gifts:  sin-fearing persons used to put their gifts there in secret, and the poor who were descended of the virtuous were secretly supported from them. The chamber of the vessels:  whoever offered a vessel as a gift would throw it in, and once in thirty days the treasurers opened it; and any vessel they found in it that was of use for the repair of the temple they left there, but the others were sold and their price went to the chamber of the repair of the temple.","1102":"There were in the Temple thirteen chests, thirteen tables and thirteen prostrations. Members of the household of Rabban Gamaliel and of Rabbi Hananiah the chief of the priests used would prostrate fourteen times. And where was the additional prostration? In front of the wood storage yard, for they had a tradition from their forefathers that the Ark was hidden there.","1103":"It once happened that a priest who was busy there noticed that the floor of the wood storage area was different from the others. He went and told it to his friend but before he had time to finish his words his soul departed. Then they knew for certain that there the Ark was hidden.","1104":"And where did they make the prostrations? Four times in the north, four times in the south, three times in the east, and twice in the west, in front of the thirteen gates. The southern gates close to the west side were: the Upper Gate, the Fuel Gate, the Gate of the Firstborn Animals, and the Water Gate. Why was it called the Water Gate? Because through it was brought in the flask of water for the libation on Sukkot. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: through it the waters trickle forth and in the time to come \u201cthey will come forth from under the threshold of the Temple\u201d (Ezekiel 47:1). On the opposite side in the north close to the west were:   Jechoniah\u2019 Gate, the Gate of the Offerings, the Gate of the Women, and the Gate of Song. And why was it called the Jechoniah\u2019 Gate? Because through it Jechoniah went out into his captivity. In the east was the Nicanor\u2019s Gate, and it had two small gates, one to the right and one to the left. There were also two gates in the west which had no name.","1105":"There were thirteen tables in the Temple:Eight of marble in the place of slaughtering and on them they would rinse the entrails. And two to the west of the ramp which ascends the altar, one of marble and one of silver; on that of marble they would place the limbs of the offerings, and on that of silver the ministering vessels. And there were two tables in the Porch on the inside of the entrance to the Temple, one of marble and the other of gold; on that of marble they would place the showbread placed when it was brought in, and on that of gold they would place the showbread when it was taken out, because things sacred may be raised in honor but not lowered. And there was one table of gold on the inside of the Sanctuary on which the showbread lay continually.","1106":"There were thirteen chests in the Temple and on them was inscribed respectively:\u201cnew shekels\u201d;\u201cNew shekels\u201d   those for each year; \u201cold shekels\u201d;\u201cOld shekels\u201d   whoever has not paid his shekel in the past year may pay it in the coming year; \u201cbird-offerings\u201d;\u201cBird-offerings\u201d   these are turtle-doves; \u201cyoung pigeons for burnt-offerings\u201d;\u201cYoung pigeons for burnt-offerings\u201d   these are young pigeons. \u201cwood\u201d; \u201cfrankincense\u201d; \u201cgold for the kapporet\u201d; and on six, \u201cfreewill offerings\u201d. Both these two chests are for burnt-offerings, the words of Rabbi Judah. But the sages say: \u201cbird-offerings\u201d one half is for sin-offerings and the other half for burnt-offerings, but \u201cyoung pigeons for burnt-offerings\u201d all goes to burnt-offerings.","1107":"One who says: \u201cBehold, I am obligated to bring wood\u201d, he may not bring less than two logs. If he says: \u201cBehold, I am obligated to bring frankincense\u201d, he may not bring less than a handful of it. If he says: \u201cBehold, I am obligated to bring gold\u201d, he may not bring less than a gold denar. \u201cOn six was inscribed \u201cfor freewill-offerings\u201d: What was done with the freewill-offerings? They would buy with them burnt-offerings, the flesh of which was for the name of God and the hides for the priests. The following is the midrash which was expounded by Yehoyada the high priest: \u201cIt is a guilt-offering; it is a guilt offering, it goes to the Lord\u201d (Leviticus 5:19). This is the general rule: anything which is brought because of a sin or because of guilt, they should purchase with it burnt offerings, the flesh of which was for the name of God and the hides for the priests. Thus the two verses are fulfilled: a guilt offering for the Lord and a guilt offering for the priests, and it says:  \u201cMoney brought as a guilt offering or as a sin offering was not deposited in the House of the Lord; it went to the priests\u201d (II Kings 12:17).","1108":"Coins which were found between the chest inscribed \u201cshekels\u201d and the chests inscribed \u201cfreewill-offerings: Nearer to the chest inscribed \u201cshekels\u201d, they go to the shekels; Nearer to the chests inscribed \u201cfreewill-offerings\u201d, they go to freewill-offerings; Half way in between, they go to freewill-offerings. Coins which were found between the chest inscribed \u201cwood\u201d and the chest inscribed \u201cfrankincense\u201d: Nearer to the chest inscribed \u201cwood\u201d, they go to the wood; Nearer to the chest inscribed \u201cfrankincense\u201d, they go to frankincense; Half way in between, they go to frankincense. Coins which were found between the chest inscribed \u201cbird-offerings\u201d and the chest inscribed \u201cyoung pigeons for burnt-offerings\u201d: Nearer to the chest inscribed \u201cbird-offerings\u201d they go to bird-offerings; Nearer to the chest inscribed \u201cyoung pigeons for burnt-offerings\u201d, they go to young pigeons for burnt-offerings; Half way in between, they go to young pigeons for burnt-offerings. Coins which were found between non-sacred money and second tithes money: Nearer to the non-sacred money, they go to common money; Nearer to the second tithes money, they go to second tithes; Half way in between, they are considered second tithes. This is the general rule: the go to that which is nearer even if this is lenient; but if half way in between, they must go to that which is the more stringent.","1109":"Money which was found in front of animal dealers in Jerusalem, it is always second tithes money; If it was found on the Temple Mount it is non-sacred money. If it was found in Jerusalem during the time of a festival, it is second tithes money. But all the rest of the year it is non-sacred money.","1110":"Meat which was found in the Temple courtyard: Limbs: they must be treated as belonging to whole burnt-offerings; Pieces: they must be treated as belonging to sin-offerings. Meat which was found in Jerusalem, must be treated as belonging to wellbeing-offerings. In both cases it must be left to become disqualified and must then go out to the place of burning. Meat which was found within the borders of Israel but outside of Jerusalem: Limbs: they must be treated as carrion; Pieces:  they are permitted. But if found during the time of a festival, when meat is abundant, it is permitted to eat it even when cut up in limbs.","1111":"Beasts which were found in Jerusalem as far as Migdal Eder and within the same distance in any direction: Males are considered as burnt-offerings; Females are considered as peace-offerings. Rabbi Judah says: that which is fit for a pesach offering, is considered as a pesach-offerings when found within thirty days before the pilgrimage of Pesach.","1112":"In olden times they used to take a pledge from any one who had found such a stray animal, until he brought its libation-offerings. Then people would leave the animal and run away. So the court decreed that its libation-offerings should come from public funds.","1113":"Rabbi Shimon said: there were seven things that the court decree and that was one of them. The others were the following:A non-Jew who sent a burnt-offering from overseas and he sent with it its libation-offerings, they are offered out of his own; But if he did not send its libation-offerings, they should be offered out of public funds. So too in the case of a convert who had died and left sacrifices, if he had also left its libation-offerings they are offered out of his own; But if not, they should be offered out of public funds. It was also a condition laid down by the court in the case of a high priest who had died that his minhah should be offered out of public funds. Rabbi Judah says: it was offered out of the property of his heirs, And had to be offered of the whole tenth.","1114":"They further decreed concerning the salt and the wood that the priests may benefit from them. And concerning the red heifer that using its ashes is not considered sacrilege. And concerning bird-offerings which had become unfit for sacrifice, that others should be offered in their place out of public funds. Rabbi Yose says:  the one who supplied the bird-offerings was bound to supply those which had to be offered in the place of those which had become unfit.","1115":"Any spit found in Jerusalem is clean except that which is found in the upper market, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says: at other times of the year spit found in the middle of the road is unclean but spit found at the sides of the road is clean; but at festivals time spit found in the middle of the road is clean, while that which is found at the sides of the road is unclean, since they are few in number, they remove themselves to the sides of the road.","1116":"All vessels found in Jerusalem on the way going down to the place of immersion   are unclean, but those found on the way going up from the place of immersion are clean; for the way down is not the same as the way up, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says: they are all clean, except the basket and the shovel or pick which are specially connected with work in cemeteries.","1117":"A slaughtering knife which was found on the fourteenth of Nisan he may slaughter with it immediately. If it was found on the thirteenth of Nisan he must immerse it again. But a chopping knife whether found on the fourteenth or on the thirteenth, he must immerse it again. If the fourteenth fell on Shabbat, he may slaughter with it immediately. If found on the fifteenth, he may slaughter with it immediately. If the chopping knife was found tied to a slaughtering knife it may be treated as the knife.","1118":"If the curtain separating the Holy of Holies from the rest of the Temple was defiled by a derived uncleanness, they immerse it within the precincts of the Temple and they bring it back in again. But if it was defiled by a principal uncleanness, they immerse it outside and spread out in the Hel. If it was new it was spread out on the roof of the colonnade, so that the people might behold its workmanship which is beautiful.","1119":"Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon the son of the chief of the priests:  the curtain was a handbreadth in thickness and was woven on seventy-two cords, and on each cord there were twenty-four threads. It was forty cubits long and twenty cubits broad, and was made by eighty-two young girls. Two curtains were made every year, and three hundred priests were needed to immerse it.","1120":"Meat of most holy things which was defiled, whether by a principal uncleanness or by a derived uncleanness, whether inside or outside the precincts of the temple:Bet Shammai say: it must all be burnt within, except when defiled outside by a principal uncleanness. But Bet Hillel say: it must all be burnt outside, except that which was defiled by a derived uncleanness within.","1121":"Rabbi Eliezer says: Sacrificial meat which was defiled by a principal uncleanness, whether inside or outside the Temple precincts, must be burned outside the Temple. Sacrificial meat which was defiled with a derived uncleanness whether inside or outside the Temple, is burned inside the Temple. Rabbi Akiva says: where it was defiled there it is burned.","1122":"The limbs of the daily burnt-offering were placed on the half of the ramp to the altar downwards on the west side. Those of the additional offering were placed on the half of the ramp downwards on the east side. While those of the new moon offerings were placed on top of the rim of the altar. The laws of the shekels and of the first-fruit are in force only when the Temple stands, but the laws of the tithe of grain and of the tithe of cattle and of the firstborn   are in force both when the Temple exists and when the Temple does not exist. One who dedicates shekels or first-fruits when the Temple does not exist, they are holy. Rabbi Shimon says: one who says \u201cthe first-fruit be holy,\u201d they are not holy.","1123":"A sukkah which is more than twenty cubits high is not valid. Rabbi Judah validates it. One which is not ten handbreadths high, or which does not have three walls, or which has more sun than shade, is not valid. An old sukkah:  Bet Shammai invalidates it and Bet Hillel validates it. What is an \u201cold sukkah\u201d? Any one which he made thirty days before the festival; but if he made it for the purpose of the festival, even at the beginning of the year, it is valid.","1124":"One who makes his sukkah under a tree, it is as if he made it within the house. One who makes a sukkah on top of another sukkah, the upper one is valid but the lower is invalid. Rabbi Judah says: if there are no occupants in the upper one, the lower one is valid.","1125":"If he spread a sheet over it because of the sun or beneath it because of falling leaves; Or if he spread a sheet over the frame of a four-post bed, the sukkah is invalid. But he may spread it over the frame of a two-post bed.","1126":"If he trained a vine or a gourd or ivy over the sukkah and put skhakh on top of it, it is not valid. But if the skhakh is more than them, or if he cut them, it is valid. This is the general rule: whatever is susceptible to ritual impurity and does not grow from the ground may not be used for skhakh, but whatever is not susceptible to ritual impurity and does grow from ground soil may be used for skhakh.","1127":"Bundles of straw, bundles of wood, and bundles of brushwood they do not use them as skhakh. But all of them, if he untied them, are valid. And they are all valid for the walls.","1128":"They may make skhakh out of wooden planks, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir forbids. If one places on top of the sukkah a plank four handbreadths wide, it is valid provided that he does not sleep under it.","1129":"A wooden roof that has no plastering: Rabbi Judah says: Bet Shammai say that he should loosen the planks and remove one from between each two. And Bet Hillel say he should either loosen the planks or remove one from between two. Rabbi Meir says, he removes one from between two, but he does not loosen the planks.","1130":"One who roofs his sukkah with iron spits or with bedposts, if the space between them equals them, it is valid. One who hollows out a haystack to make for himself a sukkah, it is not a valid sukkah.","1131":"If he hangs walls down from above to below, if they are higher than three handbreadths from the ground, it is invalid. If he raises them from the bottom to the top, if they are ten handbreadths high, it is valid. Rabbi Yose says: just as from the bottom to the top ten handbreadths suffices so from the top to the bottom ten handbreadths suffice. If he distances the skhakh three handbreadths from the walls, it is invalid.","1132":"If the roof of a house is opened, and he placed skhakh over it, if there is a distance of four cubits from the wall to the covering, it is invalid. Similarly in the case of a courtyard which is surrounded by columns. A large sukkah which was surrounded with material which is invalid for skhakh, if there is a space of four cubits beneath it, it is invalid.","1133":"One who makes his sukkah like a cone-shaped hut or leans it against a wall: Rabbi Eliezer invalidates it since it has no roof, But the sages declare it valid. A large reed mat:  if made for lying upon it is susceptible to ritual uncleanliness and is invalid as skhakh. If made for a skhakh, it may be used for skhakh and is not susceptible to uncleanliness. Rabbi Eliezer says, whether small or large: if it was made for reclining upon, it is susceptible to uncleanliness and is invalid as skhakh; if made for a covering, it is valid as a skhakh and is not susceptible to uncleanliness.","1134":"He who sleeps under a bed in the sukkah has not fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Judah said: we had the custom to sleep under a bed in the presence of the elders, and they didn\u2019t say anything to us. Rabbi Shimon said: it happened that Tabi, the slave of Rabban Gamaliel, used to sleep under the bed.   And Rabban Gamaliel said to the elders, \u201cHave you seen Tabi my slave, who is a scholar, and knows that slaves are exempt from the law of a sukkah, therefore he sleep under the bed.\u201d And incidentally we learned that he who sleeps under a bed has not fulfilled his obligation.","1135":"One who supports his sukkah with the posts of a bed, it is valid. Rabbi Judah says: if it cannot stand on its own, it is invalid. A disorderly sukkah (and whose shade is more than its sun is valid. One whose skhakh is thick like the roof of a house is valid, even though the stars cannot be seen through it.","1136":"One who makes his sukkah on the top of a wagon, or on the deck of a ship, it is valid and one may go up into it on the festival. If he made it on the top of a tree, or on the back of a camel, it is valid, but one may not go up into it on the festival. If the tree formed two walls and one was made by the hands of man, or if two were made by the hands of man and one was formed by the tree, it is valid, but one may not go up into it on the festival. If three walls were made by the hands of man and one was formed by the tree, it is valid and one may go up into it on the festival. This is the general rule:  in any case in which if the tree was removed the sukkah could stand on its own, it is valid and one may go up into it on the festival.","1137":"If one makes his sukkah between trees, so that the trees form its walls, it is valid. Those who are agents to perform a mitzvah are exempt from the obligations of sukkah. People who are sick and their attendants are exempt from the obligations of sukkah. One may eat and drink casually outside the sukkah.","1138":"It once happened that they brought a dish to Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai to taste, and two dates and a pail of water to Rabban Gamaliel and they said, \u201cBring them up to the sukkah.\u201d And when they gave Rabbi Zadok food less than the bulk of an egg, he took it in a napkin, ate it outside the sukkah and did not say a blessing after it.","1139":"Rabbi Eliezer says: a man is obligated to eat fourteen meals in the sukkah, one on each day and one on each night. But the sages say: there is no fixed number, except on the first night of the festival alone. Furthermore Rabbi Eliezer said: if one did not eat in the sukkah on the first night of the festival, he may make up for it on the last night of the festival. But the sages say: there is no compensation for this, and of this was it said: \u201cThat which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is lacking cannot be counted\u201d (Ecclesiastes 1:15).","1140":"One whose head and the greater part of his body were within the sukkah and his table within the house: Bet Shammai say: it is invalid and Bet Hillel say it valid. Bet Hillel said to Bet Shammai: Did it not in fact happen that the elders of Bet Shammai and the elders of Bet Hillel went to visit Rabbi Yohanan ben HaHoroni and found him sitting with his head and the greater part of his body within the sukkah and his table within the house, and they didn\u2019t say anything to him? Bet Shammai said to them: From there you bring proof? Indeed they said to him, \u201cIf this is your custom, then you have never in your whole life fulfilled the commandment of the sukkah.","1141":"Women, slaves and minors are exempt from the commandment of the sukkah. A minor who no longer relies on his mother is obligated in the commandment of the sukkah. It happened that the daughter-in-law of Shammai the elder gave birth and he opened up the ceiling and put skhakh on top of the bedposts on behalf of the minor.","1142":"All seven days of the festival a man must make the sukkah his permanent residence and his house his temporary residence. If rain fell, when may one be permitted to leave it? When the porridge becomes spoiled. They made a parable. To what can this be compared?  To a slave who comes to fill the cup for his master, and he poured a pitcher over his face.","1143":"A stolen or a dried up lulav is invalid. One that came from an asherah tree or from a condemned city is invalid. If its top was broken off or its leaves were detached, it is invalid. If its leaves are spread apart it is valid. Rabbi Judah says he should tie it at the top. The thorny palms of the iron mountain are valid. A lulav which is three handbreadths in length, long enough to wave, is valid.","1144":"A stolen or withered hadas is invalid. One that came from an asherah or a condemned city is invalid. If its tip was broken off, or its leaves were detached, or its berries were more numerous than its leaves, it is invalid. But if he diminished them it is valid. But he may not diminish them on the festival.","1145":"A stolen or withered aravah is invalid. One take from an asherah or from a condemned city is invalid. One whose tip was broken off or whose leaves were detached, or a tzatzefah is invalid. One that was shriveled or had lost some of its leaves, or one grown in a rain-watered soil, is valid.","1146":"Rabbi Ishmael says: three hadasim, two aravot, one lulav and one etrog, even if two of the hadasim have their tips broken off and only one is whole. Rabbi Tarfon says:  even if all three have their tips broken off. Rabbi Akiva says: just as there is one lulav and one etrog, so too only one hadas and one aravah.","1147":"An etrog which is stolen or withered is invalid. One from an asherah or a condemned city is invalid. Of orlah or of unclean terumah it is invalid. Of clean terumah, he should not take it, but if he did take it, it is valid. Of demai (doubtfully-tithed): Bet Shammai says it invalid, And Bet Hillel says it valid. Of second tithe, it should not be taken even in Jerusalem, but if he took it, it is valid.","1148":"If a rash spread out on a majority of it, or if its pitom is removed, if it is peeled, split, or perforated so that any part is missing, it is invalid. If a rash spread out on a lesser part of it, if its stem was missing, or if it is perforated but no part of it is missing, it is valid. An etrog which is black as an Ethiopian is invalid. An etrog which is green as a leek: Rabbi Meir declares it valid And Rabbi Judah declares it invalid.","1149":"The minimum size of an etrog: Rabbi Meir says: the size of a nut. Rabbi Judah says:  the size of an egg. The maximum size is such that two can be held in one hand, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Yose says, even one that can only be held with his two hands.","1150":"They may not bind the lulav except with strands of its own species, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir says: it may be bound even with a cord. Rabbi Meir said: it happened that the men of Jerusalem used to bind their lulavs with strands of gold. They answered him: but they bound it with strands of its own species underneath the strands of gold.","1151":"And where in the service do they wave the lulav? At \u201cGive thanks to the Lord\u201d (Psalm 118:1), at the beginning and at the end, and at \u201cO Lord, deliver us\u201d (118:25), the words of Bet Hillel. Bet Shammai say: also at \u201cO Lord, let us prosper.\u201d Rabbi Akiva says:  I was watching Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Joshua, and while all the people were waving their lulavs at \u201cO Lord, let us prosper\u201d they waved them only at \u201cO Lord deliver us.\u201d One who was on a journey and had no lulav to take, when he enters his house he should take it even if he is at his table. If he did not take the lulav in the morning, he should take it at any time before dusk, since the whole day is valid for taking the lulav.","1152":"One who has a slave, a woman, or a minor read the Hallel to him, he must repeat after them what they say, and a curse be upon him. If an adult recited to him, he repeats after him only Halleluyah.","1153":"In a place where the custom is to repeat verses, he should repeat; Where the custom is to say them only once, he should say them once. Where the custom is to recite a blessing afterwards, he should recite the blessing afterwards. Everything is dependent on local custom. One who purchases a lulav from his fellow in the sabbatical year, the latter should give him the etrog as a gift, since one is not permitted to purchase it in the sabbatical year.","1154":"In earlier times the lulav was taken for seven days in the Temple, and in the provinces for one day only. When the temple was destroyed, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai decreed that the lulav should be taken in the provinces for seven days in memory of the Temple, He also decreed that on the whole of the day of waving it be forbidden to eat the new produce.","1155":"If the first day of the festival falls on Shabbat, all the people bring their lulavim to the synagogue on Friday. The next day they arise early and come to the synagogue and each one recognizes his own lulav and takes it, since the sages said \u201cone cannot fulfill his obligation on the first day of the festival with his friend\u2019s lulav.\u201d But on the other days of the festival one may fulfill his obligation with the lulav of his fellow.","1156":"Rabbi Yose says: if the first day of the festival fell on Shabbat, and he forgot and carried out his lulav into the public domain, he is not liable, since he brought it out while under the influence of a religious act.","1157":"A woman may receive a lulav from her son or from her husband and put it back in water on Shabbat. Rabbi Judah says: on Shabbat they may be put it back into the water in which they were previously kept, on a festival day water may be added, and on the intermediate days of the festival the water may also be changed. A minor who knows how to shake the lulav is obligated to take the lulav.","1158":"The rituals of the lulav and the aravah are for six or seven days; The Hallel and the rejoicing are for eight days; The sukkah and the water libation are for seven days; The flute is for five or six days.","1159":"\u201cThe lulav for seven.\u201d How so? If the first day of the festival fell on Shabbat, the lulav is taken for seven days; on any other day, it is taken for six.","1160":"\u201cThe aravah seven days.\u201d How is this? If the seventh day of the ritual of the aravah fell on Shabbat, it lasts seven days; if it fell on any other day, it lasts only six.","1161":"The mitzvah of the lulav how was it carried out? If the first day of the festival fell on Shabbat, they brought their lulavim to the Temple Mount, and the attendants would receive them and arrange them on top of the portico,   and the elders laid theirs in the chamber.  And they would teach the people to say, \u201cWhoever gets my lulav in his hand, let it be his as a gift.\u201d The next day they got up early, and came to the Temple Mount and the attendants threw down their lulavim before them, and they snatched at them, and so they used to come to blows with one another. When the court saw that they reached a state of danger, they instituted that each man should take his lulav in his own home.","1162":"The mitzvah of the aravah how was it performed?There was a place below Jerusalem called Moza.  They went down there and gathered tall branches of aravot and then they came and stood them up at the sides of the altar, and their tops were bent over the altar. They then sounded a teki\u2019ah long blast, a teru\u2019ah staccato blast and again a teki\u2019ah. Every day they went round the altar once, saying, \u201cO Lord, save us, O Lord, make us prosper\u201d (Psalms 118:. Rabbi Judah says: \u201cAni vaho, save us.\u201d On that day they went round the altar seven times. When they departed, what did they say? \u201cO altar, beauty is to you! O altar, beauty is to you!\u201d Rabbi Eliezer said: they would say, \u201cTo the Lord and to you, O altar, to the Lord and to you, O altar.\u201d","1163":"As was its performance on a weekday, so was its performance on Shabbat, except that they would gather them on the eve of Shabbat and place them in golden basins so that they would not become wilted. Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka says: they used to bring palm branches and they would beat them on the ground at the sides of the altar, and that day was called \u201cthe day of the beating of the palm branches.\u201d","1164":"Immediately after beating the willows the children undo their lulavs and eat their etrogim.","1165":"The Hallel and rejoicing are on all eight days: How is this so? This teaches that one is obligated for the Hallel, for rejoicing and for honoring the festival on the last day, just as he is on all the other days of the festival. The sukkah is for seven days. How so? Once he finished eating his meal on the seventh day, he should not untie his sukkah, but he removes its contents from the time of minhah and onwards in honor of the last day of the festival.","1166":"How was the water libation performed? A golden flask holding three logs was filled from the Shiloah. When they arrived at the water gate, they sounded a teki'ah long blast, a teru'ah a staccato note and again a teki'ah. The priest then went up the ascent of the altar and turned to his left where there were two silver bowls. Rabbi Judah says: they were of plaster but they looked silver because their surfaces were darkened from the wine. They had each a hole like a slender snout, one being wide and the other narrow so that both emptied at the same time. The one on the west was for water and the one on the east for wine. If he poured the flask of water into the bowl for wine, or that of wine into that for water, he has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Judah says: with one log he performed the ceremony of the water-libation all eight days. To the priest who performed the libation they used to say, \u201cRaise your hand\u201d, for one time, a certain man poured out the water over his feet, and all the people pelted him with their etrogs.","1167":"As it was performed on weekdays, so was it was performed on Shabbat, save that on the eve of Shabbat he would fill a non-sanctified golden barrel from the Shiloah, and place it in the chamber. If it was poured away or uncovered, he would refill it from the laver, for wine or water which has become uncovered is invalid for the altar.","1168":"The flute was for five or six days. This refers to the flute at the Bet Hashoevah the place of the water-drawing which does not override Shabbat or the festival day. They said:  he who has not seen the Simchat Bet Hashoevah has never seen rejoicing in his life.","1169":"At the conclusion of the first festival day of Sukkot they descended to the Women\u2019s Court and they would make there a great enactment. And golden candlesticks were there, and four golden bowls on the top of each of them and four ladders to each, and four youths drawn from the young priests, and in their hands there were jars of oil containing one hundred and twenty logs which they poured into the bowls.","1170":"From the worn-out pants and belts of the priests they made wicks and with them they kindled the lamps. And there was not a courtyard in Jerusalem that was not illuminated by the light of the Bet Hashoevah.","1171":"Men of piety and good deeds used to dance before them with lighted torches in their hands, and they would sing songs and praises. And Levites with innumerable harps, lyres, cymbals and trumpets and other musical instruments stood upon the fifteen steps leading down from the Court of the Israelites to the Court of the Women, corresponding to the fifteen songs of ascents in the Psalms, and it was on these steps that the Levites stood with their musical instruments and sang their songs. Two priests stood by the upper gate which leads down from the Court of the Israelites to the Court of the Women, with two trumpets in their hands. When the cock crowed they sounded a teki'ah drawn-out blast, a teru'ah staccato note and again a teki'ah. When they reached the tenth step they sounded a teki'ah, a teru'ah and again a teki'ah. When they reached the Court of the Women they sounded a teki'ah, a teru'ah and again a teki'ah. They would sound their trumpets and proceed until they reached the gate which leads out to the east. When they reached the gate which leads out to the east, they turned their faces from east to west and said, \u201cOur fathers who were in this place \u2018their backs were toward the Temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east, and they worshipped the sun toward the east\u2019, but as for us, our eyes are turned to the Lord.\u201d Rabbi Judah said:  they used to repeat the last words and say \u201cWe are the Lord\u2019s and our eyes are turned to the Lord.\u201d","1172":"They never have less than twenty-one blasts in the Temple, and never more than forty-eight. Every day there were twenty-one blasts in the Temple, three at the opening of the gates,   nine at the morning tamid sacrifice, and nine at the evening tamid sacrifice. At the musafim they would add another nine. And on the eve of Shabbat they would add another six, three as a sign to the people to stop working and three to mark a distinction between the holy and the profane. On the eve of Shabbat in the intermediate days of the Sukkoth festival, there were therefore forty-eight blasts:  three at the opening of the gates, three at the upper gate,   three at the lower gate, three at the water-drawing, three at the altar, nine at the daily morning sacrifice, nine at the daily evening sacrifice, nine at the additional sacrifices, three as a sign to the people to cease from work, and three to mark a distinction between the holy and the profane.","1173":"On the first festival day of Sukkot there were thirteen bulls, two rams and one goat. Fourteen lambs remained for the other eight priestly watches.On the first day, six watches offered two each and the remaining two one each. On the second day five offered two each and the remaining four one each. On the third day four offered two each and the remaining six one each. On the fourth day three offered two each and the remaining eight one each. On the fifth day two offered two each and the remaining ten one each. On the sixth day one offered two and the remaining twelve one each. On the seventh day all were equal. On the eighth day they again cast lots as on the other festivals. They said: the watch that offered bulls on one day should not offer them on the next, but that they should take their turns in rotation.","1174":"At three periods in the year all the priestly watches shared equally in the festival sacrifices and in the division of the showbread. On Shavuot they used to say to the priest, \u201cHere is matzah for you, here is chametz for you.\u201d A watch whose period of service was fixed for that festival week offered the tamid, vow-offerings and freewill-offerings and all other public offerings; and it offered them all. A festival which fell next to Shabbat, either before or after it, all the watches shared equally in the distribution of the showbread.","1175":"If one day intervened between them Shabbat and Yom Tov, the watch whose time of service was fixed for that week took ten of the loaves, while they that were detained   took two. On all other days of the year the incoming watch took six loaves and the outgoing watch six. Rabbi Judah said, the incoming watch took seven and the outgoing five. The incoming watch divided it in the north, and the outgoing in the south. The watch of Bilgah always divided it in the south; their ring was fixed and their alcove was blocked up.","1176":"From when do they mention the powers of bringing rain? Rabbi Eliezer says: from the first day of the Festival of Sukkot. Rabbi Joshua says: on the last day of the Festival of Sukkot. Rabbi Joshua said to him: Since rain on the Festival is nothing but a sign of God\u2019s curse why should he mention it? Rabbi Eliezer said to him: I also did not say to request rain but to make mention, \u201cHe causes the wind to blow and the rain to fall\u201d in its due season. He replied to him: if so one should at all times make mention of it.","1177":"They don\u2019t pray for rain except close to the rainy season. Rabbi Judah says: One who goes down before the ark on the last day of Sukkot the last one mentions rain, the first does not; on the first day of Pesah, the first mentions, the last does not. Up until when do they request rain? Rabbi Judah says:  Until Pesah is over. Rabbi Meir says:  Until Nissan is over, as it says, \u201cNow He makes the rain fall in the first month, early rain and late rain\u201d (Joel 2:23).","1178":"On the third of Marheshvan they begin to ask for rain. Rabban Gamaliel says: on the seventh, fifteen days after the Festival of Sukkot so that the last of the Jews reaches the river Euphrates.","1179":"If the seventeenth of Marheshvan came and no rain fell, individuals begin to fast three fasts. They eat and drink after it gets dark and they are permitted to do work, to bathe, to anoint themselves with oil, to wear shoes, and to have marital relations.","1180":"If Rosh Hodesh Kislev came and no rain fell the court ordains upon the community three fasts; they may eat and drink while it is still dark and it is permissible to do work, to bathe, to anoint oneself with oil, to wear shoes, and to have marital relations.","1181":"If these passed and there was no answer, the court decrees three more fasts on the community. They may eat and drink only while it is still day; they may not work, bathe, anoint themselves with oil, wear shoes, or have marital, relations.  And the bathhouses are closed. If these passed and there was no answer the court decrees upon the community a further seven, making a total of thirteen. These are greater than the first, for on these they blast the shofar and they lock the shops. On Mondays the shutters of the shops are opened a little when it gets dark, but on Thursdays they are permitted the whole day because of the Shabbat.","1182":"If these passed and there was still no answer then they restrict engaging in business, and in building, planting, betrothal and marriage, and in greeting one another, as if they were people undesirable to God. The individuals go back to fasting anew until the end of Nisan. If Nisan passes and then rain falls this is a sign of a curse, as it is written, \u201cIt is the season of the wheat harvest.  I will pray to the Lord and He will send thunder and rain; then you will take thought and realize what a wicked thing you did in the sight of the Lord when you asked for a king\u201d (I Samuel 12:17).","1183":"What is the order of service for fast days?They take the ark out to the open space of the city. And they put ashes on the ark and on the head of the Nasi and on the head of the head of the court (av bet. And everyone else puts ashes on his own head. The elder among them says in front of them words of admonition, \u201cBrothers, it does not say of the people of Nineveh, \u2018And God saw their sackcloth and their fasting,\u2019 but, \u2018And God saw their deeds, for they turned from their evil way. (Jonah 3:10)\u2019 And in the prophets it says, \u2018And rend your heart and not your garments\u201d (Joel 2:13).","1184":"When they stand up to pray they bring down before the ark an old man conversant with the prayers, one who has children and whose house is empty of food, so that his heart is complete prayer. He recites before them twenty-four benedictions, the eighteen recited daily, to which he adds six.","1185":"These are they the six additional benedictions: Zikhronot, Shofarot, \u201cIn my distress I called to the Lord and He answered me\u201d (Psalm 120), \u201cI turn my eyes to the mountains\u201d (Psalm 121).\u201cOut of the depths I call you, O Lord\u201d (Psalm 130), \u201cA prayer of lowly man when he is faint\u201d (Psalm 102). Rabbi Judah says: he need not recite the zikhronot and shofarot, but instead he should recite the following: \u201cIf there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence\u201d (I Kings 8:37), \u201cThe word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah concerning the droughts\u201d (Jeremiah 14). And he ends each of the additional six sections with its appropriate concluding benediction.","1186":"For the first he says:  He who answered Abraham on Mt. Moriah, He shall answer you and hear the voice of your cry on this day. Blessed are You Lord who redeems Israel. For the second he says:  He who answered our fathers at the Sea of Reeds, He shall answer you and hear the voice of your cry on this day. Blessed are You Lord who remembers all forgotten things. For the third he says: He who answered Joshua in Gilgal, He shall answer you and hear the voice of your cry on this day. Blessed are You Lord who hears a blast. For the fourth he says:  He who answered Shmuel in Mitzpah, He shall answer you and hear the voice of your cry on this day. Blessed are You Lord who listens to cries. For the fifth he says: He who answered Elijah on Mt. Carmel, He shall answer you and hear the voice of your cry on this day. Blessed are You Lord who hears prayer. For the sixth he says:  He who answered Jonah in the belly of the fish, He shall answer you and hear the voice of your cry on this day. Blessed are You Lord who answers in time of trouble. For the seventh he says:  He who answered David and Shlomo his son in Jerusalem, He shall answer you and hear the voice of your cry on this day. Blessed are You Lord Who has mercy upon the land.","1187":"It happened in the days of Rabbi Halafta and Rabbi Hanina ben Tradyon that a man passed before the ark as shaliah tzibbur and completed the entire benediction and they did not respond, \u201camen.\u201d The hazzan called out:  Sound a tekiah, priests, sound a tekiah. The shaliah tzibbur continued:  He who answered Abraham on Mt. Moriah, He shall answer you and hear the voice of your cry on this day. Then the hazzan called out:  Sound a teru'ah, sons of Aaron, sound a teru'ah. The shaliah tzibbur continued:  He who answered our fathers at the Sea of Reeds, He shall answer you and hear the voice of your cry on this day. And when the matter came up before the sages, they said:  they only practiced in this way at the eastern gates on the Temple Mount.","1188":"On the first three fasts the men of the guard fast but do not complete their fast, and the men of the father\u2019s house do not fast at all. On the second three fasts the men of the guard fast and complete their fast and the men of the father\u2019s house fast but do not complete their fast. On the last seven both fast and complete their fast, the words of Rabbi Joshua. The sages say: on the first three fasts neither fast at all. On the second three, the men of the guard fast but do not complete their fast, and the men of the father\u2019s house do not fast at all. On the last seven, the men of the guard fast and complete their fast and the men of the father\u2019s house fast but do not complete their fast.","1189":"The men of the guard are permitted to drink wine in the evenings but not during the day, but the men of the father\u2019s house may not drink wine either on the day or on the preceding evening. Both the men of the guard and the men of the ma'amad may not cut their hair nor wash their clothes, but on Thursday they may do so in honor of Shabbat.","1190":"With regard to every day about which it is written in the Scroll of Fasts \u201cOne may not eulogize\u201d on the preceding day it is prohibited but on the following day it is permitted. Rabbi Yose says: it is forbidden to mourn both on the preceding day and on the following day. On days about which it is written, \u201cOne may not fast\u201d on the preceding day and on the following day it is permitted. Rabbi Yose says: on the preceding day it is forbidden but on the following day it is permitted.","1191":"They do not decree upon the community a fast to begin on a Thursday in order not to cause a rise in the market prices. Rather the first three fasts are held in this order, Monday, Thursday, and Monday; the second three, Thursday, Monday, and Thursday. Rabbi Yose says: just as the first three fasts should not begin on a Thursday so too neither the second three nor the last seven.","1192":"They do not ordain upon the community a fast on Rosh Hodesh, on Hanukkah, or on Purim, but if they had already begun a series of fasts and one of these days intervened they do not interrupt their fasts, the words of Rabban Gamaliel. Rabbi Meir said: even though Rabban Gamaliel said that the fasts should not be interrupted he agrees that they should not complete their fasts. And the same applies to the Ninth of Av should it fall on Friday.","1193":"The order of public fasts mentioned above is enacted because of lack of the first rain, but if the crops have undergone an unusual change they sound a blast immediately. Similarly, if the rain has stopped for forty days between one rainfall and the next, they sound a blast immediately, because it is a plague of drought.","1194":"If rain falls for crops but not for the trees, for the trees but not for crops, for both of these but not for cisterns, ditches and caves they sound a blast immediately.","1195":"And so too a city, upon which no rain has fallen  as it is written, \u201cAnd I caused it to rain upon one city, and I caused it not to rain upon another city; one piece was rained upon\u2026\u201d that city fasts and they sound a blast, but those in the places around it fast but do not sound the alarm. Rabbi Akiva says: they sound the alarm but do not fast.","1196":"And so too a city which has a plague or its buildings collapse that city fasts and they sound a blast, but those in the places around it fast but do not sound the alarm. Rabbi Akiva says: they sound the alarm but do not fast. What constitutes a plague? If in a city that can supply five hundred foot-soldiers and three deaths occurred on three consecutive days, behold this constitutes a plague, less than this is not a plague.","1197":"For these they sound a blast in all places:  for the drying up of crops (shidafon), for plant disease, for locusts, and for the hasil (a type of locust), for wild beasts and for the sword they sound a blast for these are plagues likely to spread.","1198":"It once happened that elders went down from Jerusalem to their own cities and ordered a fast because there was seen in Ashkelon a shidafon which affected as much grain as would fill an oven with loaves. They also decreed a fast because wolves devoured two children on the other side of the Jordan. Rabbi Yose says: not because they devoured the children but merely because they were seen.","1199":"For these matters they sound a blast even on Shabbat: if a city is besieged by Gentile troops or a river, or if a ship is foundering on the sea. Rabbi Yose says: they sound a blast for help but not for an outcry (for the sake of prayer). Shimon the Yemenite says: also for a plague, but the sages did not agree with him.","1200":"For every trouble that should not come upon the community they sound a blast except on account of too much rain. It happened that they said to Honi the circle drawer: \u201cPray for rain to fall.\u201d He replied: \u201cGo and bring in the pesah ovens so that they do not dissolve.\u201d He prayed and no rain fell. What did he do? He drew a circle and stood within it and exclaimed before Him:  \u201cMaster of the universe, Your children have turned their faces to me because I am like one who was born in Your house.  I swear by Your great name that I will not move from here until You have mercy upon Your children.\u201d Rain then began to drip, and he exclaimed:  \u201cI did not request this but rain which can fill cisterns, ditches and caves. The rain then began to come down with great force, and he exclaimed:  \u201cI did not request this but pleasing rain of blessing and abudance.\u201d Rain then fell in the normal way until the Jews in Jerusalem had to go up Temple Mount because of the rain. They came and said to him: \u201cIn the same way that you prayed for the rain to fall pray now for the rain to stop.\u201d He replied:  \u201cGo and see if the stone of people claiming lost objects has washed away.\u201d Rabbi Shimon ben Shetah sent to him: \u201cWere you not Honi I would have excommunicated you, but what can I do to you, for you are spoiled before God and he does your will like a son that is spoiled before his father and his father does his request.  Concerning you it is written, \u201cLet your father and your mother rejoice, and let she that bore you rejoice\u201d (Proverbs 23:25).","1201":"If while they are fasting rain falls: If before sunrise they do not complete the fast, If after sunrise, they do complete the fast. Rabbi Eliezer says: if before noon they do not complete the fast, if after noon they do complete it. It happened that the rabbis decreed a fast in Lod and rain fell before noon. Rabbi Tarfon said to them: go, eat and drink and make a holiday. They went and ate and drank and observed the day as a holiday and at evening time they came and recited the Hallel Hagadol.","1202":"On three occasions during the year, on fast days, on ma\u2019amadot,  and on Yom Kippur the priests lift up their hands to bless the people four times during the day--at Shaharit, at Mussaf, at Minhah and at Neilah.","1203":"What are the ma\u2019amadot?  Since it is said, \u201cCommand the children of Israel and say to them: My offering, My food\u201d (Numbers 28:2).  Now how can a man\u2019s offering be offered and he is not present?  Therefore the former prophets instituted twenty-four mishmarot (guards).  For each mishmar there was a ma\u2019amad at the Temple in Jerusalem consisting of priests, Levites and Israelites. When the time came for the mishmar to go up to Jerusalem the priests and Levites went up to Jerusalem and the Israelites of that mishmar assembled in their cities and read the story of creation.","1204":"The men of the maamad fasted on four days of that week, from Monday to Thursday; they did not fast on Friday out of respect for Shabbat or on Sunday in order not to switch from the rest and delight of Shabbat to weariness and fasting and thereby die. On Sunday they read, \u201cIn the beginning,\u201d and, \u201cLet there be a firmament;\u201d On Monday, \u201cLet there be a firmament,\u201d and, \u201cLet the waters be gathered together;\u201d On Tuesday, \u201cLet the waters be gathered together,\u201d and, \u201cLet there be lights;\u201d On Wednesday, \u201cLet there be lights,\u201d and, \u201cLet the waters swarm;\u201d On Thursday, \u201cLet the waters swarm,\u201d and, \u201cLet the earth bring forth;\u201d On Friday, \u201cLet the earth bring forth,\u201d and, \u201cAnd the heavens and the earth were completed.\u201d For a long section two people read and for a short section one person.  This is how they would read at Shacharit and Mussaf. And at minhah they assemble and read the section by heart, as they recite the Shema. On Friday at minhah they did not assemble out of respect for Shabbat.","1205":"On any day when there is Hallel there was no maamad at Shaharit; On the day when there is a Musaf-offering, there was no maamad at Ne'ilah. On the day of the wood-offering, there was no maamad at Minhah, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Ben Azzai said to him: Thus did Rabbi Joshua learn: On the day when there is a Musaf-offering, there was no maamad at Minhah; On the day of the wood-offering, there was no maamad at Ne\u2019ilah. Rabbi Akiva retracted and learned like Ben Azzai.","1206":"The times of the wood of the priests and the people was nine:On the first of Nisan the family Arah of Yehudah. On the twentieth of Tammuz the family of David of Yehudah. On the fifth of Av the family of Parosh of Yehudah. On the seventh of the same month, the family of Yonadav of Rechav. On the tenth of the same month, the family of Snaah of Benjamin. On the fifteenth of the same month, the family of Zattu of Yehudah, and with them were the priests and Levites and all those who were not certain of their tribe and the family of Gonve Eli and the family of Kotze Ketizot. On the twentieth of the same month the family of Pahat Moav of Yehudah. On the twentieth of Elul the family of Adin of Yehudah. On the first of Tevet the family of Parosh of Yehudah offered a second time. On the first of Tevet there was no maamad for there was Hallel, Musaf and the wood-festival.","1207":"There were five events that happened to our ancestors on the seventeenth of Tammuz and five on the ninth of Av.On the seventeenth of Tammuz: The tablets were shattered; The tamid offering was cancelled; The walls of the city were breached; And Apostomos burned the Torah, and placed an idol in the Temple. On the ninth of Av It was decreed that our ancestors should not enter the land, The Temple was destroyed the first And the second time, Betar was captured, And the city was plowed up. When Av enters, they limit their rejoicing.","1208":"During the week in which the ninth of Av falls it is forbidden to cut the hair and to wash clothes but on Thursday it is permitted in honor of Shabbat. On the eve of the ninth of Av one should not eat a meal of two cooked dishes, nor should he eat meat or drink wine. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: one should make change his diet. Rabbi Judah obligated turning over the bed, but the sages did not agree with him.","1209":"Section one:  Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel said: There were no days of joy in Israel greater than the fifteenth of Av and Yom Kippur. Section two:  On these days the daughters of Jerusalem would go out in borrowed white garments in order not to shame any one who had none. All these garments required immersion.  The daughters of Jerusalem come out and dance in the vineyards. What would they say?  Young man, lift up your eyes and see what you choose for yourself. Do not set your eyes on beauty but set your eyes on the family. \u201cGrace is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman that fears the Lord, she shall be praised\u201d (Proverbs 31:30).  And it further says, \u201cGive her of the fruit of her hands; and let her works praise her in the gates\u201d (ibid, 31:31). Section three:  Similarly it says, \u201cO maidens of Zion, go forth and gaze upon King Solomon wearing the crown that his mother gave him on his wedding day, on the day of the gladness of his heart\u201d (Song of Songs 3:11).  \u201cOn his wedding day\u201d:  this refers to Matan Torah (the Giving of the Torah). \u201cAnd on the day of the gladness of his heart\u201d: this refers to the building of the Temple; may it be rebuilt speedily in our days, Amen.","1210":"Seven days before Yom HaKippurim they remove the high priest from his house to the chamber of the counselors and they set up another priest to take his place lest something should occur to him to disqualify him from being able to worship. Rabbi Judah said: they even prepare another wife for him in case his wife should die, as it says \u201cAnd he shall make atonement for himself and for his house\u201d (Leviticus 16:6):  \u201chis house\u201d this refers to his wife. They said to him: if so there would be no end to the matter.","1211":"All seven days he sprinkles the blood and burns the incense and cleans lamps and offers the head and the leg; And on all other days if he wants he offers, for the high priest is first in offering a portion and has first place in taking a portion.","1212":"They delivered to him elders from the elders of the court and they read before him throughout the seven days from the order of the day.  And they say to him, \u201cSir, high priest, you read it yourself with your own mouth, lest you have forgotten or lest you have never learned.\u201d On the eve of Yom HaKippurim in the morning they place him at the eastern gate and pass before him oxen, rams and sheep, so that he may recognize and become familiar with the service.","1213":"All seven days they did not withhold food or drink from him. On the eve of Yom HaKippurim near nightfall they would not let him eat much because food brings about sleep.","1214":"The elders of the court handed him over to the elders of the priesthood and they took him up to the upper chamber of the house of Avtinas. They adjured him and then left.  And they said to him when leaving: \u201cSir, high priest, we are messengers of the court and you are our messenger and the messenger of the court. We adjure you by the one that caused His name dwell in this house that you do not change anything of what we said to you.\u201d He turned aside and wept and they turned aside and wept.","1215":"If he was a sage he would expound, and if not, the disciples of the sages would expound before him. If he was familiar with reading the Scriptures he would read, if not they would read before him. From what would they read before him? From Job, Ezra and Chronicles. Zechariah ben Kv\u2019utal says: I have often read before him from Daniel.","1216":"If he wished to sleep, young priests would snap their middle finger before him and say: \u201cSir high priest, stand up and drive the sleep away by standing once on this cold floor. They would keep him busy until the time for the slaughtering of the daily morning offering would arrive.","1217":"Every day they would remove the ashes from the altar at the cock\u2019s crow or close to that time, either before or after. But on Yom HaKippurim from midnight, and on the festivals at the end of the first watch; And the cock\u2019s crow would not arrive before the Temple court was full of Israelites.","1218":"Originally anyone who wished to remove the ashes from the altar did so. When they were many, they would run up the ramp of the altar and he that came first within four cubits won the privilege. If two were even, the officer would say to them all: raise the finger! And how many did they put out? One or two but one does not put out a thumb in the Temple.","1219":"Section one:  It once happened that two were even as they ran up the ramp, and one of them pushed his fellow who fell and broke his leg. When the court saw that they incurred danger, they decreed that they would remove the ashes from only by a count. Section two:  There were four counts. This is the first count.","1220":"The second count:who slaughters the daily regular offering, who sprinkles the blood, who removes the ashes from the inner altar, who removes the ashes from the candlestick, 5-10)  Who takes the limbs of the offering up to the ramp, the head and the right hind-leg, the two forelegs, the tail and the left hind-leg, the breast and the throat, the two flanks, the innards, the fine flour, the cakes and the wine. Altogether thirteen priests merited a task. Ben Azzai said before Rabbi Akiba in the name of Rabbi Joshua: the daily offering was offered up in the way it walks.","1221":"The third count: \u201cNew priests come up and submit to the count for the incense.\u201d The fourth count: \u201cNew and old priests, who will take up the limbs from the ramp to the altar.\u201d","1222":"The tamid was offered up by nine, ten, eleven or twelve priests, neither by more, nor by less. How so? The offering itself by nine; At the festival of Sukkot in the hand of one a flask of water, behold there were ten. In the evening by eleven: The offering itself by nine and in the hands of two men were two logs of wood. On Shabbat by eleven: The offering itself by nine, in the hands of two men two handfuls of incense for the showbread. And on Shabbat which fell during the festival of Sukkot one man carried in his hand a flask of water.","1223":"A ram was offered by eleven: the flesh by five, the innards, the fine flour, and the wine by two each.","1224":"A bull was offered by twenty-four: The head and right hind-leg: the head by one and the right hind-leg by two. The tail and left hind-leg:  the tail by two and the left hind-leg by two. The breast and neck:  the breast by one and the neck by three. The two fore-legs by two, The two flanks by two. The innards, the fine flour, and the wine by three each. To what does this refer? To communal offerings. But individual offerings, if a single priest wants to offer all, he may do so. But as to the flaying and dismembering of both communal and individual sacrifices the same regulations apply.","1225":"The officer said to them: \u201cGo out and see whether the time for slaughtering the morning sacrifice has arrived.\u201d If it had arrived then he who saw it said: \u201cIt is daylight!\u201d Matitya ben Shmuel says: \u201cThe whole east is light.\u201d  Even unto Hebron?   And he answered \u201cYes.\u201d","1226":"And why was all that necessary? Because once the light of the moon rose and they thought that the east was lit up and slaughtered the continual offering, and afterwards they had to take it out to the place of burning. They led the high priest down to the place of immersion. This was the rule in the Temple: whoever covers his feet required an immersion, and whoever passed water required sanctification by washing his hands and feet.","1227":"A man may not enter the Temple courtyard or to worship even if he was clean until he immerses himself. Five immersions and ten sanctifications did the high priest perform on that day. And all in sanctity in the Bet Haparvah with the exception of this one alone.","1228":"They spread out a linen sheet between him and the people. He stripped off his clothes, went down and immersed himself, came up and dried himself. They brought him the golden garments, he put them on and sanctified his hands and feet. They brought him the tamid. He made the required cut and some one else finished it for him. He received the blood and sprinkled it. He went inside to smoke the morning incense and to trim the lamps; And to offer up the head and the limbs and the griddle cakes and the wine.","1229":"The morning incense was offered up between the blood and the limbs, The dusk incense was offered between the limbs and the drink-offerings. If the high priest was either old or of delicate health warm water they would heat some water for him and pour into the cold water, to temper its coldness.","1230":"They brought him to the Bet Haparvah, which was on holy ground. They spread a sheet of linen between him and the people. He sanctified his hands and his feet and stripped. Rabbi Meir says: he stripped and then sanctified his hands and his feet. He went down and immersed himself, came up and dried himself. Afterwards they brought him white garments. He put them on and sanctified his hands and his feet.","1231":"In the morning he would wear Pelusian linen worth twelve minas (1200 dinar\/zuz); at dusk Indian linen worth eight hundred zuz, the words of Rabbi Meir. The sages say: in the morning he would wear garments worth eighteen minas and at dusk garments worth twelve minas, altogether thirty minas. These costs were at the charge of the community and if he wanted to add, he adds more out of his own pocket.","1232":"He came to his bull and his bull was standing between the Ulam and the altar, its head to the south and its face to the west. And the priest stands on the eastside facing the west. And he lays both his hands upon it and confesses. And thus he would say: \u201cPlease, \u2018Hashem\u2019! I have done wrong, I have transgressed, I have sinned before You, I and my house. Please, \u2018Hashem\u2019! Forgive the wrongdoings, the transgressions, the sins which I have committed and transgressed and sinned before You, I and my house, as it is written in the torah of Moses Your servant: \u201cFor on this day shall atonement be made for you to cleanse you of all your sins; you shall be clean before the Lord\u201d (Leviticus 16:30). And they answered after him: \u201cBlessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever!\u201d","1233":"He then went to the east of the Temple court, to the north of the altar, the deputy high priest at his right and the head of the priestly family ministering that week at his left. There were two goats and an urn was there, and in it were two lots. They were of box-wood and Ben Gamala made them of gold and they would mention his name in praise.","1234":"Ben Katin made twelve spigots for the laver, for there had been before only two. He also made a mechanism for the laver, in order that its water should not become unfit by remaining overnight. King Monbaz had all the handles of all the vessels used on Yom HaKippurim made of gold. His mother Helena made a golden candelabrum over the opening of the Hekhal. She also made a golden tablet, on which the portion concerning the suspected adulteress was inscribed. For Nicanor miracles happened to his doors. And they were all mentioned for praise.","1235":"And these they mentioned to their shame:Those of the House of Garmu did not want to teach anything about the preparation of the showbread. Those of the House of Avtinas did not teach to anything about the preparation of the incense. Hugros, a Levite knew a chapter concerning the song but did not want to teach it. Ben Kamtzar did not want teach anyone his art of writing. Concerning the former it is said: \u201cThe memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing\u201d (Proverbs 10:7); concerning the others it is said: \u201cBut the name of the wicked shall rot.\u201d","1236":"He shook the urn and brought up the two lots. On one was inscribed: \u201cFor the Name\u201d, and on the other: \u201cFor Azazel.\u201d The deputy high priest was at his right hand, the head of the ministering family at his left. If the lot \u201cFor the Name\u201d came up in his right hand, the deputy high priest would say to him: \u201cSir, high priest, raise your right hand!\u201d And if the lot \u201cFor the Name\u201d came up in his left hand, the head of the family would say: \u201cSir high priest, raise your left hand!\u201d Then he placed them on the two goats and said: \u201cA sin-offering for the Lord!\u201d Rabbi Ishmael said: he did not need to say, \u201ca sin-offering\u201d, but just \u201cfor the Lord.\u201d And they answered after him: \u201cBlessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever!\u201d","1237":"He bound a thread of crimson wool on the head of the goat which was to be sent away,   and he placed it at the gate where it was later to be sent away, and on the goat that was to be slaughtered he placed a thread of crimson wool on its neck at the place of the slaughtering. He came to his bull a second time, pressed his two hands upon it and made confession. And thus he would say: \u201cPlease, \u2018Hashem\u2019! I have done wrong, I have transgressed, I have sinned before You, I and my house and the sons of Aaron Your holy people. Please, \u2018Hashem\u2019! Forgive the wrongdoings, the transgressions, the sins which I have committed and transgressed and sinned before You, I and my house and the sons of Aaron Your holy people, as it is written in the torah of Moses Your servant: \u201cFor on this day shall atonement be made for you to cleanse you of all your sins; you shall be clean before the Lord\u201d (Leviticus 16:30). And they answered after him: \u201cBlessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever!\u201d","1238":"He killed it the bull and received its blood in a bowl, and he gave it to the one who stirs it up on the fourth terrace within the sanctuary so that it should not congeal. He took the coal-pan and went up to the top of the altar, and cleared the coals to both sides, and took a panful of the inner glowing cinders, and he came down and placed the coal-pan on the fourth terrace in the Temple Court.","1239":"On other days he would take out the cinders with a silver coal-pan, and empty it into one of gold, but this day he took them out with a golden coal-pan and in it he brought them into the Hekhal. On other days he would take them up with a coal-pan containing four kabs, and empty it into one containing three kabs, but this day he took them out with one containing three kabs, and in it he brought them in. Rabbi Yose says: on other days he would take them out with a coal-pan containing one se\u2019ah, and empty it into one containing three kabs, this day he took them out with one containing three kabs, and in it he brought them in. On other days the pan was heavy, today it was light. On other days its handle was short, today it was long. On other days it was of yellowish gold, today of reddish gold, the words of Rabbi Menahem. On other days he would offer half a mina in the morning and half a mina in the afternoon, today he adds also his two hands full. On other days the incense was finely ground, but today it was the most finely ground possible.","1240":"On other days the priests would go up on the east side of the ramp and come down on the west side, but this day the high priest goes up in the middle and comes down in the middle. Rabbi Judah says: the high priest always goes up in the middle and comes down in the middle. On other days the high priest sanctified his hands and feet from the laver, but this day from a golden ladle. Rabbi Judah says: the high priest always sanctifies his hands and feet from a golden ladle.","1241":"On other days there were four wood-piles there, but on this day five, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says: on other days three, but on this day four. Rabbi Judah says: on other days two, but on this day three.","1242":"They brought out to him the ladle and the pan and he took two hands full of incense and put it into the ladle, a large high priest according to his size, a small one according to his size and thus was its measure. He took the pan in his right hand and the ladle in his left hand.  He walked through the Hechal until he came to the place between the two curtains which separated the Holy from the Holy of Holies; between them was a space of one cubit. Rabbi Yose says: there was but one curtain, as it is said: \u201cAnd the curtain shall serve you as a partition between the Holy and the Holy of Holies\u201d (Exodus 26:33). The outer curtain was looped on the south side and the inner curtain on the north side.  He walked along between them until he reached the north side. When he reached the north side he turned round to the south and went on along the curtain, to his left, until he reached the Ark. When he reached the Ark he put the pan of burning coals between the two poles.  He heaped up the incense upon the coals and the whole house became full with smoke. He came out by the way he entered and in the outer house he uttered a short prayer.  He did not make the prayer long so as not to frighten Israel.","1243":"After the Ark had been taken away, there was a stone from the days of the earlier prophets,   called \u201cshtiyah\u201d, three fingers above the ground, on which he would place the pan of burning coals.","1244":"He would take the blood from the one who was stirring it, and enter again into the place where he had entered, and stand again on the place on which he had stood, and sprinkle once upwards and seven times downwards, and he wouldn\u2019t intend to sprinkle either upwards nor downwards but rather like one who cracks a whip. And thus would he count: one, one and one, one and two, one and three, one and four, one and five, one and six, one and seven. Then he would go out and put it on the golden stand in the sanctuary.","1245":"They would bring him the goat.  He would slay it and receive its blood in a bowl. He entered again into the place where he had entered, and stood again on the place on which he had stood, and sprinkled once upwards and seven times downwards, and he wouldn\u2019t intend to sprinkle either upwards or downwards but rather like one who cracks a whip.  And thus would he count: one, one and one, one and two, one and three, one and four, one and five, one and six, one and seven. Then he would go out and place it on the second golden stand in the Hekhal. Rabbi Judah said: there was only one golden stand there. He would take the blood of the bull and put down the blood of the goat, and sprinkle from it upon the curtains facing the Ark outside, once upwards, seven times downward, aiming to sprinkle neither upwards nor downwards, and he wouldn\u2019t intend to sprinkle either upwards or downwards but rather like one who cracks a whip. Thus would he count as above. Then he would take the blood of the goat, and put down the blood of the bull, and sprinkle from it upon the curtain facing the ark outside once upwards, seven times downwards as above. Then he would pour the blood of the bull into the blood of the goat emptying the full vessel into the empty one.","1246":"\u201cAnd he shall go out to the altar that is before the Lord\u201d (Leviticus 16:18): that is the golden altar. He then began to purify the altar by sprinkling in downward motion. From where does he begin? From the northeast horn of the altar, then the northwest, then the southwest, then the southeast. From the place where he begins sprinkling when offering a sin-offering on the outer altar, there he completes sprinkling on the inner altar. Rabbi Eliezer says: he remained in his place and sprinkled. And on every horn he would sprinkle from below upwards, with the exception of the horn at which he was standing, which he would sprinkle from above downwards.","1247":"Then he sprinkled the top of the altar seven times. And he would pour out the remainder of the blood at the western base of the outer altar. And the remainder of the blood sprinkled on the outer altar he poured out at the southern base. Both mingled in the aqueduct and flowed into Nahal Kidron, and they were sold to gardeners as manure and by using them one transgresses the law of trespass (meilah).","1248":"Concerning every act of Yom Hakippurim mentioned in the prescribed order in the mishnah: if he performed one later act before an earlier one, it is as if it had not been done at all. If he dealt with the blood of the goat before the blood of the bull, he must start over again, and sprinkle the blood of the goat after the blood of the bull. If before he had finished the sprinklings within the Holy of Holies the blood was poured away, he must bring other blood, and start over again and sprinkle again within the Holy of Holies. Similarly, in the Hekhal and the golden altar, since they are each a separate act of atonement. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: wherever he stopped, there he may begin again.","1249":"The two goats of Yom Hakkippurim: it is a requirement that they be alike in appearance, in size, in value, and that they be bought at the same time. But if they are not alike they are still valid. If he bought one today and the other tomorrow, they are valid. If one of them died before the lot was cast another one is bought for the second one. But if one of them died after the lot was cast another pair must be bought and he must cast lots for them over again. If the one that \u2018For Hashem\u2019 died, he the high priest should say: \u201cThis one upon which the lot \u2018For Hashem\u2019 has fallen stands in its stead.\u201d And if the one that was \u2018For Azazel\u2019 died he should say: \u201cThis one upon which the lot \u2018For Azazel\u2019 has fallen stands in its stead.\u201d The other one is left to pasture until it becomes blemished and it is to be sold and its value goes to the chest for voluntary offerings, for the sin-offering of the congregation is not be left to die. Rabbi Judah says: it is left to die. Furthermore Rabbi Judah said: if the blood was poured away, the goat which is to be sent away is left to die. If the goat to be sent away died the blood is poured.","1250":"He then came to the scapegoat and laid his two hands upon it and he made confession. And thus he would say: \u201cPlease, \u2018Hashem\u2019! They have done wrong, they have transgressed, they have sinned before You, Your people the House of Israel.  Please, in the name of Hashem (Bashem)!  Forgive the wrongdoings, the transgressions, the sins which your people, the House of Israel, have committed and transgressed and sinned before You, as it is written in the torah of Moses Your servant: \u201cFor on this day shall atonement be made for you to cleanse you of all your sins; you shall be clean before the Lord\u201d (Leviticus 16:30). And the priests and the people standing in the courtyard, when they would hear God\u2019s name explicated coming out of the high priest\u2019s mouth, would bend their knees, bow down and fall on their faces and say \u201cBlessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever!\u201d","1251":"They handed it over to him who was to lead it away. All were fit to lead it away, but the priests made a fixed rule not to permit an Israelite to lead it away. Rabbi Yose said: it once happened that Arsela led it away, although he was an Israelite.","1252":"And they made a ramp for him because of the Babylonians, who would pull its hair, shouting to it: \u201cTake it and go out, take it and go out.\u201d Some of the important people of Jerusalem used to go with him up to the first booth. There were ten booths from Jerusalem to Tzuk a distance of ninety ris, seven and a half of which make a mil.","1253":"At every booth they would say to him: here is food and here is water. And they went with him from booth to booth, except the last one, who would not go with him up to Zuk, but rather stand from afar, and see what he was doing.","1254":"What did he do? He divided the thread of crimson wool, and tied one half to the rock, the other half between its horns, and pushed it from behind, and it went rolling down and before it had reached half its way down hill it had broken into limbs. He came back and sat down under the last booth until it grew dark. And from when are his clothes unclean? From the moment he has gone outside the walls of Jerusalem. Rabbi Shimon says: from the moment he pushes it into Zuk.","1255":"He the high priest came to the bull and the goat that were to be burnt. He cut them open and took out the sacrificial portions and put them on a tray, and them burned them on the altar. He twisted them around carrying poles and took them out to the place of burning. And from when are his clothes unclean? After they have gone outside the walls of the Temple courtyard. Rabbi Shimon says: from the moment the fire has taken hold of most of them.","1256":"They said to the high priest: the goat has reached the wilderness. And how did they know that the goat had reached the wilderness?They used to set up scouts and they would wave scarves, and they would know that the goat had reached the wilderness. Rabbi Judah said: but did they not have a great sign? From Jerusalem to Bet Hidudo was three mils. They could walk a mil, return the mil, then wait the time it takes to walk a mil, and thus know that the goat had reached the wilderness. Rabbi Ishmael said: but did they not have another sign! A thread of crimson wool was tied to the door of the Temple, and when the goat reached the wilderness the thread turned white, as it is written, \u201cThough your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow\u201d (Isaiah 1:18).","1257":"The high priest then came to read. If he wished to read in linen garments, he reads, and if not he reads in his own white cloak. The synagogue attendant would take a Torah scroll and give it to the head of the synagogue, and the head of the synagogue gives it to deputy high priest, and the deputy high priest gives it to the high priest, and the high priest stands and receives it, and reads, section beginning \u201cAfter the death \u2026\u201d   and \u201cBut on the tenth\u2026\u201d which is in the Book of Numbers he recites by heart. And he recites on it eight benedictions: \u201cFor the law\u201d, \u201cFor the Temple service,\u201d \u201cFor thanksgiving,\u201d \u201cFor the forgiveness of sins\u201d and \u201cFor the Temple\u201d on its own, and \u201cFor Israel\u201d on its own and \u201cFor Jerusalem\u201d on its own, \u201cFor the priests\u201d on their own and \u201cFor the rest of the prayer.\u201d","1258":"He who sees the high priest when he reads does not see the bull and the goat that are being burned, and he that sees the bull and the goat that are being burned does not see the high priest when he reads, not because he was not permitted but because the distance apart was great and both rites were performed at the same time.","1259":"If he read in the garments of linen, he would then sanctify his hands and feet, strip off his clothes, go down and immerse himself, come up and dry himself. They brought him the golden clothes, he put them on, sanctified his hands and feet, went out, offered up his own ram and the ram of the people, and the seven unblemished, one-year-old-lambs, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Akiba said: these were offered up together with the morning tamid of the morning, The bull for the whole burnt offering and the goat which is offered up outside were offered up together with the dusk tamid.","1260":"He then sanctified his hands and feet, stripped off his clothes, went down and immersed himself, came up and dried himself. They brought him the white clothes, he put them on and sanctified his hands and his feet. Then he went in to bring out the ladle and the fire-pan. He then sanctified his hands and feet, stripped off his clothes, went down and immersed himself, came up and dry himself. They brought him the golden clothes, he put them on, sanctified his hands and feet, and went in to burn up the dusk incense, and takes care of the lamp. He sanctified his hands and feet and stripped, went down, immersed himself, came up and dried himself. They brought him his own clothes and he put them on. And they would accompany him to his house. And he would make a day of festivity for his friends whenever he came out of the Holy of Holies in peace.","1261":"The high priest performs the service in eight pieces of clothing, and the common priest in four: in tunic, breeches, a headdress, and a sash. The high priest adds the breastpiece, the ephod, the robe and the frontlet. In these were the Urim and Tummim inquired of. But they were not inquired of except by the king, by the head of the court or by one whom the community needs.","1262":"On Yom HaKippurim it is forbidden to eat, to drink, to wash, to anoint oneself, to put on sandals, or to have intercourse. A king or bride may wash their face, and a woman after childbirth may put on sandals, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But the sages forbid it.","1263":"If one eats an amount the size of a large date, like it and its seed, or if he drank an amount equivalent to a mouthful, he is liable. All foods add up to make an amount equivalent to a date, and all the liquids add up to make a mouthful.  Food and drink do not add up.","1264":"If he ate and drank in one state of unawareness, he is not obligated to bring more than one sin-offering. But if he ate and performed labor while in one state of unawareness he is obligated for two sin-offerings. If he ate foods unfit for eating, or drank liquids unfit for drinking, or drank fish-brine or fish pickling liquid, he is not liable.","1265":"With regard to children: they do not \u201cafflict\u201d them at all on Yom HaKippurim. But they train them a year or two before in order that they become accustomed to the commandments.","1266":"If a pregnant woman smelled food on Yom Kippur, they feed her until she feels restored. A sick person is fed at the word of experts. And if no experts are there, they feed him upon his own request until he says: enough.","1267":"If one is seized by a ravenous hunger, they feed him even unclean things until his eyes light up and he returns to health. If one was bit by a mad dog, they do not feed him the lobe of its liver. But Rabbi Matia ben Harash permits it. Moreover Rabbi Matia ben Harash said: if one has pain in his throat, they may drop medicine into his mouth on Shabbat, because it is a possibility of danger to human life and every potential danger to human life overrides Shabbat.","1268":"If an avalanche fell on someone, and it is doubtful whether or not he is there, or whether he is alive or dead, or whether he is an Israelite or a non-Jew, they remove the debris from above him even on Shabbat. If they find him alive they remove the debris, but if dead they should leave him there until Shabbat is over.","1269":"The sin-offering and the certain guilt-offering effect atonement. Death and Yom HaKippurim effect atonement together with repentance. Repentance effects atonement for light transgressions: the transgression of positive commandments and negative commandments. And for severer transgressions repentance suspends the divine punishment, until Yom HaKippurim arrives and effects atonement.","1270":"One who says: I shall sin and repent, sin and repent, they do not afford him the opportunity to repent. If one says: I shall sin and Yom HaKippurim will atone for me, Yom HaKippurim does not effect atonement. For transgressions between man and God Yom HaKippurim effects atonement, but for transgressions between man and his fellow Yom HaKippurim does not effect atonement, until he has pacified his fellow. This was expounded by Rabbi Elazar b. Azariah: \u201cFrom all your sins before the Lord you shall be clean\u201d   for transgressions between man and God Yom HaKippurim effects atonement, but for transgressions between man and his fellow Yom HaKippurim does not effect atonement, until he has pacified his fellow.. Rabbi Akiva said: Happy are you, Israel! Who is it before whom you become pure? And who is it that purifies you? Your Father who is in heaven, as it is said: \u201cAnd I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean\u201d of Israel, O Lord\u201d (Jeremiah 17:1--just as a mikveh purifies the unclean, so too does he Holy One, blessed be He, purify Israel.","1271":"One who brings a get from abroad to the Land of Israel must declare, \u201cIn my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed.\u201d Rabban Gamaliel says: even one who brings it from Rekem or from Heger. Rabbi Eliezer says: even one who brings it from Kefar Ludim to Lud. The sages, however, say: declaration \u201cIn my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed\u201d is required only from one who brings a get from abroad or who takes it there. One who brings a get from one province to another province in foreign lands is also required to declare, \u201cIn my presence it was written, and in my presence it was signed.\u201d Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: even from one hegemony to another hegemony.","1272":"Rabbi Judah says: From Rekem eastwards, Rekem being like the east; from Ashkelon southwards, Ashkelon being like the south; and from Acco northwards, Acco being like the north. Rabbi Meir says: Acco counts as the land of Israel in the matter of bills of divorce.","1273":"One who brings a get within the land of Israel need not declare, \u201cIn my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed.\u201d If there are those who protest its validity it must be established through the signatures. If one who brings a get from abroad is not able to declare \u201cIn my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed\u201d, if there are witnesses on it, its validity can be established through its signatures.","1274":"Both bills of divorce and writs of emancipation are similar concerning a messenger who takes them abroad from the land of Israel too brings them from abroad to the land of Israel. This is one of the ways in which bills of divorce are similar to writs of emancipation.","1275":"Any document which has upon it the signature of a Samaritan is invalid, except for bills of divorce or a writ of emancipation. It happened that a bill of divorce was once brought before Rabban Gamaliel at Kefar Otnai and its witnesses were Samaritan, and he declared it valid. All documents which are accepted in the courts of non-Jew, even if those who signed on the documents are non-Jews, are valid except bills of divorce and of writs of emancipation. Rabbi Shimon says: these also are valid; they were only pronounced to be invalid when done by ordinary persons.","1276":"If a man says: \u201cGive this get to my wife or this writ of emancipation to my slave\u201d, if he wants he may change his mind on either document, the words of Rabbi Meir. The Sages say: he may change his mind in the case of the get but not in the case of the writ of emancipation, since a benefit may be conferred on a person not in his presence but a disability may be imposed on him only in his presence; for if he does not want to maintain his slave he is permitted, but if he does not want to maintain his wife he is not permitted. Rabbi Meir said to them: behold, he disqualifies his slave from eating terumah by emancipating him in the same way that he disqualifies his wife by divorcing her? They said to him: the slave is disqualified because he is the priest\u2019s property. If a man says, \u201cGive this get to my wife or this writ of emancipation to my slave\u201d, and dies before they are given, they do not give the documents after his death. If he said, \u201cGive a maneh to so-and-so\u201d and died, the money should be given after his death.","1277":"If one brings a get from abroad and declares: \u201cIt was written in my presence\u201d but not, \u201cIt was signed in my presence\u201d; \u201cIt was signed in my presence\u201d but not \u201cIt was written in my presence\u201d; \u201cAll of it was written in my presence and in my presence but only one of the witnesses signed in my presence\u201d; \u201cHalf was written in my presence but both witnesses signed in my presence\u201d;   in all these cases the get is invalid. If one says \u201cIt was written in my presence\u201d and another says, \u201cIt was signed in my presence\u201d, the get is invalid. If two say, \u201cIt was written in our presence\u201d and another says, \u201cIt was signed in my presence\u201d, it is invalid. Rabbi Judah declares it valid. If one says, \u201cIt was written in my presence\u201d and two say, \u201cIt was signed in our presence\u201d, it is valid.","1278":"If a get was written by day and signed on the same day, written by night and signed on the same night, written by night and signed on the day following, it is valid. If it was written by day and signed on the night following, it is invalid. Rabbi Shimon validates it, for Rabbi Shimon used to say that all documents written by day and signed on the following night are invalid except bills of divorce.","1279":"They write a get with any material, with ink, with arsenic, with red chalk, with gum or with sulfate of copper or with anything which is lasting. It may not be written with liquids or with fruit juice or with anything that is not lasting. They write a get on anything: on an olive leaf, on the horn of an ox and he must give her the ox, or on the hand of a slave--and he must give her the slave. Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: they do not write a get on anything living or on food.","1280":"They do not write a get on something still attached to the ground. If he wrote it on something still attached, and then detached and signed and given to the wife, it is valid. Rabbi Judah invalidates it until it is both written and signed on something detached from the ground. Rabbi Judah ben Batera says:  they do not write a get on a sheet from which writing has been erased nor on semi-finished parchment, for it can be faked. But the sages validate such a get.","1281":"All are qualified to write a get, even a deaf-mute, an imbecile and a minor. A woman may write her own get and a man his own receipt for the ketubah, since the document is upheld only by its signatures. All are qualified to bring a get except a deaf-mute, an imbecile, a minor, a blind person and a non-Jew.","1282":"If the minor had received the get in order to deliver it and then became of age; or the deaf-mute received the get and then his speech was restored; or the blind person received the get and then his sight was restored; or the imbecile received the get and then his reason returned; or the Gentile received the get and then converted, the get is invalid. But if a person of sound senses received the get and then became a deaf-mute and then recovered his speech; or one with sight received the get and then became blind and then recovered his sight; or one who was sane received the get and then went insane and then recovered his reason, the get is valid. The general principle is that anyone who begins and finishes his mission in full possession of his mental faculties is qualified.","1283":"Even the women who are not trusted to say \u201cHer husband died,\u201d are trusted to bring her get:  her mother-in-law, the daughter of her mother-in-law, her rival wife, her sister-in-law and the daughter of her husband. What is the difference between the get and death? The writing on the get proves that she is divorced. A woman may bring her own get but she must say, \u201cIn my presence it was signed and in my presence it was delivered.\u201d","1284":"Any get which is not written expressly for the woman for whom it is intended is invalid. How is this so? If a man was passing through the street and heard the voice of a scribe dictating \u201cSo-and-so divorces so-and-so from such and such a place\u201d and he says \u201cthat is my name and that is the name of my wife\u201d, it is not a valid document with which to divorce his wife. Moreover: if he wrote a get with which to divorce his wife and changed his mind and a person found him and said to him, \u201cMy name is the same as yours and my wife\u2019s name the same as your wife's\u201d, it is not a valid document with which the second may divorce his wife. Moreover: if he had two wives with the same name and wrote a get with which to divorce the elder, he may not use it to divorce the younger. Moreover: if he said to the scribe, \u201cWrite a get and I will divorce whichever I choose,\u201d it is not a valid document with which to divorce his wife.","1285":"A scribe who writes out formulas of bills of divorce must leave blank spaces for the name of the man and the name of the woman and the date. A scribe who writes loan documents must leave blank spaces for the name of the lender, the name of the borrower, the amount of money and the date. A scribe who writes sale documents must leave blank spaces for the name of the seller, the name of the purchaser, the amount of money, the property and the date; These spaces must be left blank because of the \u201ctakkanah\u201d (enactment). Rabbi Judah disqualifies all of them. Rabbi Elazar validates all of them valid except divorce documents, as it says, \u201cHe writes for her\u201d (Deut 24:1), expressly for her.","1286":"One who brings a get and loses it on the way: If he finds it immediately it is valid, and if not it is not valid. If he finds it in a small bag or in a folder if he recognizes it, it is valid. If one brings a get and left the husband when the husband was an old man or sick, he should deliver it to her on the presumption that he is still alive. If the daughter of an ordinary Israelite is married to a priest and her husband goes abroad, she continues eating terumah on the presumption that he is still alive. If a man sends a sin-offering from abroad they sacrifice it on the presumption that he is still alive.","1287":"Three statements were made by Rabbi Elazar ben Parta before the Sages, and they upheld his words. About people in a besieged town; And about people on a ship listing at sea; And a person who has been brought to court in a capital case that they are presumed to be alive. However, concerning people in a besieged town which has been captured; Or people in a ship which has been lost at sea; Or a person who has been led out to execution we put upon them all of the stringencies of their being alive and all of the stringencies of their being dead. The daughter of an Israelite who has married a priest or the daughter of a priest who has married an Israelite may not eat of the terumah.","1288":"If one bringing a get in the land of Israel becomes sick, he can send it with another. But if the husband said to him, \u201cTake for me from her such-and-such an object\u201d, he may not send it the get with another, since the husband may not want his deposit in the hand of another.","1289":"If one bringing a get from abroad becomes sick, he may arrange a court of law and send him on with the get, declaring before them, \u201cIn my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed.\u201d And the last agent is not required to say, \u201cIn my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed\u201d, rather he declares, \u201cI am the messenger of a court.\u201d","1290":"If a man lends money to a priest or a levite or a poor man on condition that he can may separate terumah or tithes from their portion, he may do so, in the presumption that they are still alive, and he need not be concerned that the priest or the levite may have died or the poor man may have become rich. If they died, he must obtain the permission of the heirs. If he made the loan in the presence of the court, he need not obtain permission from the heirs.","1291":"If a man sets aside produce in order to count it as terumah and tithe, or money in order to count it as second tithe, he may continue to count it as such in the presumption that they still exist. If they are lost, he must be concerned from time period to time period, the words of Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua. Rabbi Judah says: at three seasons they check the wine: when the east wind begins to blow at the end of Sukkot, when the buds first appear on the vine, and when the juice begins to form in the grapes.","1292":"If man sends a get to his wife and then catches up with the messenger, or sends a messenger after the original messenger, and says to him, \u201cThe get which I gave you is annulled\u201d, then it is annulled. If the husband arrives at his wife before the messenger or sends a messenger to her and says, \u201cThe get which I sent to you is annulled\u201d, then it is annulled. Once the get has reached her hand, he cannot annul it.","1293":"Originally, a husband would bring together a court wherever he was and annul the get. Rabban Gamaliel the Elder established that this should not be done, because of \u201ctikkun olam\u201d. Originally the husband would change his name, or his wife\u2019s name, or the name of his town or of his wife\u2019s town. Rabban Gamaliel the Elder established that he should write, \u201cThe man so-and-so or any name that he has,\u201d;  \u201cthe woman so-and-so or any name that she has,\u201d because of \u201ctikkun olam.\u201d","1294":"A widow is paid back her kethubah from the property of orphans only by taking an oath.   When the court refrained from imposing an oath on her, Rabban Gamaliel the Elder established that she could take any vow which the orphans wanted and collect her kethubah. Witnesses sign their names on a get because of tikkun olam. Hillel instituted the prosbul because of tikkun olam.","1295":"A non-Jewish slave of a Jew was taken captive and then ransomed by a third party: If he is ransomed to be a slave he goes back to slavery, If he is ransomed as a free man he does not go back to slavery. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  in either case he goes back to slavery. If a man makes his slave a pledge for a debt to another man and then he emancipates him, according to the \u201cletter of the law\u201d the slave is not liable to do anything. But because of tikkun olam we force his second master to emancipate him and he the slave writes a document for his purchase price. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says that the slave does not write the document but rather the one who emancipates him.","1296":"One who is half a slave and half free works for his master one day and for himself one day, the words of Beth Hillel. Beth Shammai said to them: you have set things right for the master but you have not set things right for the slave. He cannot marry a female slave because he is already half free, and he cannot marry a free woman because he is half a slave.  Shall he then decease from having children? But wasn\u2019t the world only made to be populated, as it says, \u201cHe did not create it as a waste, he formed it to be inhabited\u201d (Isaiah 45:18)?  Rather because of tikkun olam we compel his master to emancipate him and he writes a document for half his purchase price. Beth Hillel retracted their opinion and ruled like Beth Shammai.","1297":"If a man sells his slave to a Gentile or to someone living outside the land of Israel the slave goes free. Captives should not be redeemed for more than their value, because of tikkun olam. Captives should not be helped to escape, because of tikkun olam. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says that the reason is to prevent the ill-treatment of fellow captives. Torah scrolls of the law, tefillin and mezuzoth are not bought from Gentiles at more than their value, because of tikkun olam.","1298":"If a man divorces his wife because of ill-repute, he cannot remarry her. If because of a vow, he cannot remarry her. Rabbi Judah says: if he divorces her for vows which she made in front of many people, he may not remarry her, but if for vows which she did not make in front of many people, he may remarry her. Rabbi Meir says: if he divorces her for a vow which requires the investigation of a sage, he may not remarry her, but if for one which does not require the investigation of a sage, he may remarry her. Rabbi Eliezer says:  they only forbid that one because of that one . Rabbi Yose son of Rabbi Judah said: a case happened in Sidon of a man who said to his wife, \u201cKonam, if I do not divorce you\u201d, and he did divorce her, and the Sages permitted him to remarry her  because of tikkun olam.","1299":"A man divorces his wife because she is an aylonit: Rabbi Judah says he may not remarry her, But the sages say that he may remarry her. She marries someone else and has children from him and then demands her ketubah settlement from her first husband: Rabbi Judah said, they say to her, \u201cYour silence is better than your speaking.\u201d","1300":"If a man sells himself and his children to a Gentile, he is not to be redeemed but his children are to be redeemed after the death of their father. If a man sells his field to a Gentile, and an Israelite bought it back, he has to bring, the purchaser must bring first fruits from it, because of tikkun olam.","1301":"Damages are paid out of property of the best quality; A creditor pays out of land of medium quality, And a ketubah is paid out of land of the poorest quality. Rabbi Meir says that a ketubah is also paid out of medium quality land.","1302":"Payment cannot be recovered from mortgaged property where there free property is available, even if it is only of the lowest quality. Payment can be recovered from orphans only from land of the lowest quality.","1303":"Creditors do not collect from mortgaged property for produce consumed, for the improvement of property, and payment for the maintenance of a widow and daughters, because of tikkun olam. The finder of a lost article is not required to take an oath, because of tikkun olam.","1304":"If orphans relied on a householder or if their father appointed a guardian for them, he must tithe their produce. A guardian who was appointed by the father of the orphans is required to take an oath.  A guardian who was appointed by the court does not need to take an oath. Abba Shaul says that the rule is the reverse. One who renders impure someone else\u2019s pure food or mixes terumah with someone else\u2019s non-terumah produce or makes a libation with someone else\u2019s wine, if he does so inadvertently, he is exempt, but if intentionally he is liable. Priests who intentionally made someone else\u2019s sacrifice piggul in the Temple are liable.","1305":"Rabbi Yohanan ben Gudgada testified concerning a deaf-mute whose father had given her in marriage, that she could be sent away with a bill of divorcement; And concerning a minor, daughter of an Israelite who married a priest, that she could eat terumah, and if she died her husband inherited from her; And concerning a stolen beam that had been built into a palace, that it might be restored by the payment of its value, because of the enactment to encourage repentance. And concerning a sin-offering that had been stolen, and this was not known to many,   that it caused atonement because of the welfare of the altar.","1306":"There was no sicaricon in Judea for those killed in war. After the war\u2019s slaughter ended there is sicaricon there. How so? If a man buys a field from the Sicaricon and then buys it again from the original owner, his purchase is void, but if he buys it first from the original owner and then from the sicaricon it is valid. If a man buys a piece of a married woman\u2019s property from the husband and then buys it from the wife, the purchase is void, but if he buys it first from the wife and then from the husband it is valid. This was the ruling of the first mishnah. The court that came after them said if a man buys property from the Sicaricon he had to give the original owner a quarter of the value. When is this so? When the original owners cannot buy it themselves, but if they can they have preemption over everyone else. Rabbi assembled a court and they decided by vote that if the property had been in the hands of the Sicaricon twelve months, whoever purchased it first acquired the title, but he had to give a quarter of the price to the original owner.","1307":"A deaf-mute can gesture and be gestured at and thereby conduct transactions. Ben Betera says that he may make lip-motions, if the transaction is of movable property. The purchase or sale done by young children in movable property is valid.","1308":"These were the rules they laid down because of the ways of peace:A priest is called up first to read the Torah and after him a Levite and then an Israelite, because of the ways of peace. An \u201ceruv\u201d is placed in the room where it has always been placed, because of the ways of peace. The cistern which is nearest to the channel is filled first, because of the ways of peace. Taking of beasts, birds and fishes from traps set by others is robbery, because of the ways of peace. Rabbi Yose says that it is actual robbery. Taking away anything found by a deaf-mute, an idiot or a minor is robbery, because of the ways of peace. Rabbi Yose says that it is actual robbery. If a poor man strikes down olives on top of an olive tree, taking the fruit that is beneath him is robbery. Rabbi Yose says that it is actual robbery. Poor Gentiles are not prevented from gathering gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and the corners of the field, because of the ways of peace.","1309":"A woman may lend to another woman who is suspected of not observing the sabbatical year a fan or a sieve or a handmill or a stove, but she should not sift or grind with her. The wife of a \u201chaver\u201d may lend to the wife of an \u201cam ha-aretz\u201d a fan or a sieve and may winnow and grind and sift with her, but once she has poured water over the flour she should not touch anything with her, because we do not assist those who commit a transgression. All these rules were only said because of the ways of peace. Gentiles may be wished luck in the Sabbatical year but not Israelites and greeting may be given to them, because of the ways of peace.","1310":"If a man says, \u201cReceive this get on behalf of my wife\u201d, or, \u201cCarry this get to my wife\u201d, if he desires to retract before the wife receives it he may do so. If a woman says, \u201cReceive the get on my behalf\u201d, and he does so, if the husband wants to retract he may not do so. Therefore if the husband said to him, \u201cI do not want you to receive it on her behalf, but rather carry it and give it to her\u201d, then if he wishes to retract he may do so. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: even if the wife says \u201cTake for me\u201d, and he does so the husband may not retract.","1311":"A woman who said to an agent, \u201cReceive my get for me\u201d requires two sets of witnesses, two to say, \u201cIn our presence she told him\u201d, and two to say, \u201cIn our presence he received the get and tore it\u201d. Even if the first set are the same witnesses as the latter set or if there was one in the first set and one in the second, and one joined with them for both testimonies. If a young girl is betrothed, both she and her father may receive her get. Rabbi Judah said that two different hands cannot take possession as one.  Rather her father alone may receive her get. One who is not able to keep her get is not capable of being divorced.","1312":"If a young girl says, \u201cReceive my get for me\u201d, it is not a get until the get reaches her hand. Therefore, if the husband wishes to retract, he may retract, since a minor cannot appoint an agent. But if her father said to him, \u201cGo and receive a get for my daughter\u201d, the husband may not retract. If a man says, \u201cGive this get to my wife in such-and-such a place\u201d and he gives it to her in another place, the get is invalid. If he says, \u201cShe is in such-and-such a place\u201d, and he gives it to her in another place, it is valid. If a woman says, \u201cReceive my get in such-and-such a place\u201d and he receives it for her in another place, it is invalid. Rabbi Elazar says it valid. If she says, \u201cBring me my get from such-and-such a place\u201d and he brings it from somewhere else, it is valid.","1313":"If a woman says to an agent, \u201cBring me my get\u201d, she may eat terumah until the get reaches her hand. If she says, \u201cReceive for me my get\u201d, she is forbidden to eat terumah immediately.   If she says, \u201cReceive for me my get in such-and-such a place\u201d, she can eat terumah until the get reaches that place. Rabbi Elazar says that she is forbidden immediately.","1314":"If a man says, \u201cWrite a get and give it to my wife\u201d, or \u201cDivorce her\u201d, or \u201cWrite a letter and give it to her\u201d, then they should write it and give it to her. If he said, \u201cRelease her\u201d, or \u201cProvide for her\u201d, or \u201cDo for her as the law dictates\u201d, or \u201cDo the proper thing for her\u201d, he has not said anything. Originally they said that if a man was being led out to execution and said, \u201cWrite a get for my wife\u201d, they may write a get and give it to her. Later they said, even if he were leaving for a sea voyage or for a caravan journey. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: even if he were dangerously ill.","1315":"If a man had been thrown into a pit and cried out, \u201cWhoever hears his voice should write a get for his wife\u201d, those who hear should write a get and give it to her. If a healthy man says, \u201cWrite a get for my wife\u201d, his intention is merely to play with her. It once happened that a man in good health said, \u201cWrite a get for my wife\u201d, and then went up on to a roof and fell and died, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said that the Sages said:  if he had thrown himself down this is a get, but if the wind had blown him over it was not a get.","1316":"If a man said to two people, \u201cGive a get to my wife\u201d, or to three people, \u201cWrite a get and give it to my wife\u201d, they must write it and give it. If he said to three persons, \u201cGive a get to my wife\u201d, they may tell others to write the get because he has made them into a court, the words of Rabbi Meir. And this is the halakhah which Rabbi Hanina a man of Ono brought from prison:  \u201cI have received a tradition that if a man says to three persons, \u2018Give a get to my wife\u2019, they may tell others to write it, because he has made them into a court. Rabbi Yose said: We said to the messenger, we also have a tradition that even were he to say to the great court in Jerusalem, \u2018Give a get to my wife\u2019, they must learn to write and write the get and give it. If a man says to ten persons, \u201cWrite a get\u201d, one writes, and two sign as witnesses. If he said, \u201cAll of you write\u201d, one writes and all sign. Therefore, if one of them dies, the get is invalid.","1317":"If a man is gripped by the kordiakos illness and says, \u201cWrite a get for my wife\u201d, he has not said anything. If he says, \u201cWrite a get for my wife\u201d, and is then gripped by kordiakos and then says, \u201cDo not write it\u201d, his latter words are of no effect. If he becomes mute, and they say to him, \u201cShould we write a get for your wife\u201d, and he nods his head, he is tested three times. If he answers \u2018no\u2019 and \u2018yes\u2019 properly each time, then they should write the get.","1318":"They said to him, \u201cShall we write a get for your wife\u201d, and he said to them, \u201cWrite!\u201d, and they then told a scribe and he wrote and witnesses and they signed even if they wrote it and signed it and gave it back to him and he gave it to her, the get is void until he himself says to the scribe \u201cWrite\u201d and to the witnesses, \u201cSign\u201d.","1319":"If a husband says, \u201cThis is your get if I die\u201d, or \u201cThis is your get if I die from this illness\u201d, or \u201cThis is your get after my death\u201d, he has not said anything. If he says, \u201cThis is your get from today if I die\u201d, or \u201cThis is your get from now if I die\u201d, the get is valid. If he says, \u201cThis is your get from today and after my death\u201d, it is both a get and not a get. If he dies without offspring she must perform halizah but she cannot marry the husband\u2019s brother. If he said, \u201cThis is your get from today if I die from this illness\u201d, and he then got up and went about and fell sick and died, we estimate the probable cause of his death; if he died from the first illness, the get is valid, but otherwise not.","1320":"She should not be alone with him except in the presence of witnesses, even a slave or a handmaid  any witness is sufficient except for her own female slave, since she can take liberties in front of her own handmaid. What is her status during those days? Rabbi Judah says that she is regarded as a married woman in every respect. Rabbi Yose says that she is both divorced and not divorced.","1321":"If a husband says, \u201cThis is your get on condition that you give me two hundred zuz\u201d, she is divorced and she has to give him the money. If he says, \u201cOn condition that you give the money to within thirty days from now, if she gives him within thirty days she is divorced, but if not she is not divorced. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: \u201cIt happened in Sidon that a man said to his wife, \u201cThis is your get on condition that you give me my robe\u201d, and his robe was lost, and the Sages said that she should give him its value in money.","1322":"If a husband says, \u201cThis is your get on condition that you look after my father\u201d, or \u201cOn condition that you nurse my child\u201d How long must she nurse? Two years. Rabbi Judah says, eighteen months. If the child dies or the father dies, the get is valid. If he says, \u201cThis is your get on condition that you look after my father for two years\u201d, or \u201cOn condition that you nurse my child for two years\u201d, if the child dies or if the father says, \u201cI don't want you to look after me\u201d, even though she has not caused him to complain, the get is invalid. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  something like this is a get. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said a general rule: wherever the obstacle does not arise from her side, the get is valid.","1323":" If a husband says, \"This is your get if I do not return within thirty days\", and he was going from Judea to Galilee, if he got as far as Antipatras and then returned, his condition is broken.    If he says, \"This is your get if I do not return within thirty days\", and he was going from Galilee to Judea, if he got as far as Kefar Otnai and then returned, the condition is broken. If he said, \"This is your get if I do not return within thirty days\", and he was going into foreign parts, if he got as far as Acco and then returned his condition is broken. If he said, \"This is your get as long as I shall keep away from you for thirty days\", even though he came and went and came and went, since he was not secluded with her, the get is valid.","1324":"If a husband says, \u201cThis is your get if I do not return within twelve months\u201d, and he dies within twelve months, it is not a get. If he says, \u201cThis is your get from now if I do not return within twelve months\u201d, and he dies within twelve months, it is a get. ","1325":"If a husband says, \u201cIf I do not come back within twelve months, write a get and give it to my wife\u201d, and they wrote a get before twelve months had passed and gave it to her after, it is not a get. If he said, \u201cWrite a get and give it to my wife if I do not come back within twelve months\u201d, and they wrote it before the twelve months had passed and gave it after, it is no get. Rabbi Yose says:  like this is a get. If they wrote it after twelve months and delivered it after twelve months and he died, if the delivery of the get preceded his death the get is valid, but if his death preceded the delivery of the get it is not valid. If it is not known which was first, this is the woman about whom they said, \u201cShe is divorced and not divorced.\u201d","1326":"If a husband throws a get to his wife, and she is in her house or in her courtyard, she is divorced. If he throws it to her in his house or in his courtyard, even though it is with her on the same bed, she is not divorced. If he throws it into her lap or into her basket, she is divorced.","1327":"If he said to her, \u201cTake in this debt document\u201d, or if she found it behind him and read it and it turned out to be her get, it is not a get, until he says to her, \u201cHere is your get.\u201d If he put it into her hand while she was asleep and when she woke up she read it and found it was her get, it is not a get until he says to her, \u201cHere is your get.\u201d If she was standing in the public domain and he threw it to her, if it lands near her she is divorced, but if it lands near him she is not divorced. If it lands midway, she is divorced and not divorced.","1328":"Similarly with betrothals and similarly with a debt. If a man\u2019s creditor said to him, \u201cThrow me my debt\u201d, and he threw it to him, if it lands nearer to the creditor, the borrower is credited with paying back his debt; if it lands nearer to the borrower, the borrower is still obligated to repay the money; if it lands midway, they divide. If she was standing on a roof and he threw it up to her, as soon as it reaches the airspace of the roof, she is divorced. If he was above and she below and he threw it to her, once it has left the space of the roof, even were it to be immediately erased or burnt, she is divorced.","1329":"Bet Shammai says:  a man may divorce his wife with an old get, But Bet Hillel forbids this. What is meant by an old get? One where he was secluded with her after he wrote it.","1330":"If the get was dated by an unfit kingship, by the empire of Medea, by the empire of Greece, by the building of the Temple or by the destruction of the Temple, Or if being in the east he wrote \u201cin the west\u201d, or being in the west he wrote \u201cin the east\u201d, She must leave this one and that one, and she also requires a get from this one and that one. She has no ketubah, no usufruct, no support money or worn clothes, neither from this one nor from that one. If she has taken anything from this one or that one, she must return it. The child from this one or that one is a mamzer. Neither this one nor that one may impurify himself for her. Neither this one and that one has a claim to whatever she may find, nor what she makes with her hands, nor to invalidate her vows. If she was the daughter of an Israelite, she becomes disqualified from marrying a priest; if the daughter of a Levite, from the eating of tithe; and if the daughter of a priest, from the eating of terumah. Neither the heirs of this one nor the heirs of that one are entitled to inherit her ketubah. And if the husbands die, the brother of the one and the brother of the other must perform halitzah, but may not contract yibbum. If his name or her name or the name of his town or the name of her town was wrongly given, she must leave both husbands and all the above consequences apply to her.","1331":"With regard to all of the near relatives concerning whom they said \u201ctheir rivals are permitted to marry without halitzah\u201d:  If the rival wives went and married and it was then found that this one was an aylonit, the rival wife who married must leave both husbands and all these consequences apply to her.","1332":"If a man marries his sister-in-law and her rival wife goes and marries another man and it was found that the first is an aylonit, the other must leave both husbands and all these consequences apply to her.","1333":"If a scribe wrote a get for the husband and a receipt for the wife and by mistake gave the get to the wife and the receipt to the husband and the two exchanged them and after some time the get came out of the hands of the man and the receipt out of the hands of the woman, she must leave both husbands and all these things apply to her. Rabbi Elazar says:  if it comes out of her hands immediately, it is not a get, but if it comes out of her hands after some time, it is a get; it is not in the power of the first to render void the right of the second. If a man wrote a get with which to divorce his wife and then changed his mind, Bet Shammai says that he has disqualified her from marrying a priest. Bet Hillel says that even if he gave it to her with a certain stipulation, if the condition was not fulfilled, he has not disqualified her for marrying a priest.","1334":"A man divorces his wife and then stays with her over night in an inn: Bet Shammai says:  she does not require from him a second get, But Beth Hillel say she does require a second get from him. When is this so?  When she was divorced after marriage. And Beth Hillel agrees that if she is divorced after betrothal, she does not require a second get from him, because he would not yet take liberties with her. If a man marries a divorced woman through a \u201cbald\u201d get, she must leave both husbands and all the above-mentioned consequences apply to her.","1335":"A \u201cbald\u201d get anyone can complete its signatures, the words of Ben Nannas. But Rabbi Akiva says that it may be completed only by relatives who are qualified to testify elsewhere. What is a \u201cbald\u201d get? One which has more folds than signatures.","1336":"If a man divorces his wife and said to her, \u201cYou are free to marry any man but so-and-so\u201d, Rabbi Eliezer permits her to marry on the strength of this get, but the rabbis forbid her. What should he do? He should take it back from her and give it to her again saying, \u201cYou are free to marry any man.\u201d If he wrote the restriction in the get, even though he went back and erased it, it is invalid.","1337":"If he said, \u201cYou are permitted to any man but my father, your father, my brother, your brother, a slave, a Gentile, or anyone to whom she is incapable of being betrothed,\u201d the get is valid. If he said, \u201cYou are permitted to anyone but a high priest, or, an ordinary priest, or, a regular Israelite, or a mamzer or a natin, or anyone who is capable of betrothing her even in transgression, the get is invalid.","1338":"The body of the get is: \u201cBehold you are permitted to any man.\u201d Rabbi Judah says: he must add \u201cAnd this shall be to you from me a writ of divorce and a letter of release and a bill of dismissal, with which you may go and marry any man that you wish.\u201d The body of a writ of emancipation is: \u201cBehold you are a free woman\u201d, \u201cBehold you belong to yourself.\u201d","1339":"There are three gittin which are invalid but if a woman marries on the strength of one of them the child is fit:If the husband wrote it with his own hand but there are no witnesses on it. If there are witnesses on it but no date. If it has a date but only one witness. These are three gittin which are invalid but if a woman marries on the strength of one of them the child is fit. Rabbi Elazar says even though there are no witnesses on it, as long as he gave it to her in the presence of witnesses it is valid, and on the strength of it she may collect her ketubah even from mortgaged property, since the witnesses only sign on the get because of tikkun olam.","1340":"Two men sent two identical gittin to their wives and they became mixed up they give both of them to this wife and both of them to this wife. Therefore, if one of them was lost the other is void. If five men wrote jointly in the same get, \u201cSo-and-so divorces so-and-so and so-and-so divorces so-and-so and the witnesses signed below, all are valid and the get is to be given to each of the women. If the scribe wrote out the formula for each one and the witnesses signed below, only the one with which the signatures are read is valid.","1341":"If two gittin are written on the same sheet side by side and the signatures of two witnesses in Hebrew stretch from under one to under the other and then signatures of two witnesses in Greek stretch from under one get to under the other, the one with which the two first signatures are read is valid. If there is one signature in Hebrew and one in Greek and then another signature in Hebrew and a signature in Greek stretching from under one get to under the other, both are invalid.","1342":"If he left over some of the get from the first sheet and he wrote the rest of the get on the next column and the witnesses sign below, the get is valid. If the witnesses have signed at the top of the sheet or at the side or on the back of a simple get, it is invalid. If he connected the top of one get to the top of another and the witnesses\u2019 signatures are between the two, both of them are invalid. If the end of one is connected to the end of the other and the witnesses\u2019 signatures are between, the one with which the witnesses\u2019 signatures reads is valid. If the top of one is connected to the bottom of the other and the witnesses\u2019 signatures are in the middle, the one with which the witnesses\u2019 signatures reads is valid.","1343":"A get which was written in Hebrew and whose signatures are in Greek, or was written in Greek and whose signatures are in Hebrew, or which has one Hebrew signature and one Greek signature, or which was written by a scribe and signed by one witness, is valid.

If he signs, \u201cSo-and-so son of so-and-so\u201d and he didn\u2019t write \u201cwitness\u201d, it is valid. If he wrote his own family name and hers, the get is valid. And this is how the scrupulous in Jerusalem would do. A get given imposed by court:  in the case of a Jewish court is valid, and in the case of a Gentile court is invalid. And with regard to Gentiles, if they beat him and say to him, \u201cDo what the Israelites say to you,\u201d (and it is valid).","1344":"If a report goes out in the town: \u201cA certain woman is betrothed,\u201d she is regarded as betrothed; If a report goes out in the town: \u201cA certain woman is divorced,\u201d she is regarded as divorced. This is only the case provided the report has no qualification. What is meant by a qualification? If the report is, \u201cSo-and-so divorced his wife with a stipulation\u201d or, \u201cHe threw her the betrothal money, but it is uncertain whether it landed nearer to her or nearer to him\u201d   this is a qualification.","1345":"Bet Shammai says: a man should not divorce his wife unless he has found her guilty of some unseemly conduct, as it says, \u201cBecause he has found some unseemly thing in her.\u201d Bet Hillel says that he may divorce her even if she has merely burnt his dish, since it says,  \u201cBecause he has found some unseemly thing in her.\u201d Rabbi Akiva says, he may divorce her even if he finds another woman more beautiful than she is, as it says, \u201cit cometh to pass, if she find no favour in his eyes.","1346":"A virgin is married on the fourth day of the week and a widow on the fifth day, for twice in the week the courts sit in the towns, on the second day of the week and on the fifth day, so that if he the husband had a claim as to the virginity of the bride he could go early on the morning of the fifth day of the week to the court.","1347":"A virgin   her kethubah is two hundred zuz, and a widow   a maneh (100. A virgin, who is a widow, or divorced, or a halutzah from betrothal   her kethubah  is two hundred zuz, and there is upon her a claim of non-virginity. A female proselyte, a woman captive, and a woman slave, who have been redeemed, converted, or freed when they were less than three years and one day old   their kethubah is two hundred zuz there is upon them a claim of non-virginity.","1348":"When an adult has had sexual intercourse with a young girl, or when a small boy has had intercourse with an adult woman, or a girl who was injured by a piece of wood     in all these cases their kethubah is two hundred zuz, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say: a girl who was injured by a piece of wood   her kethubah is a maneh.","1349":"A virgin, who was a widow, a divorcee, or a halutzah from marriage  her kethubah is a maneh, and there is no claim of non-virginity upon her. A female proselyte, a woman captive and a woman slave, who have been redeemed, converted, or freed when they were more than three years and one day old   their kethubah is a maneh, and there is no claim of non-virginity upon her.","1350":"He who eats with his father-in-law in Judea without the presence of witnesses cannot raise a claim of non-virginity against his wife because he has been alone with her. It is the same whether the woman is an Israelite widow or a priestly widow    her kethubah is a maneh. The court of the priests collected for a virgin four hundred zuz, and the sages did not protest.","1351":"If a man marries a woman and does not find her to be a virgin: She says, \u201cAfter you betrothed me I was raped, and so your field has been washed away\u201d And he says, \u201cNo, rather it occurred before I betrothed you and my acquisition was a mistaken acquisition\u201d Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer say:  she is believed. Rabbi Joshua says: We do not live by her mouth, rather she is in the presumption of having had intercourse before she was betrothed and having deceived him, until she brings proof for her statement.","1352":"She says, \u201cI was struck by a piece of wood\u201d, And he says, \u201cNo, you, rather you have been trampled by a man\u201d Rabban gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer say: she is believed, And Rabbi Joshua says: We do not live by her mouth, rather she is in the presumption of having been trampled by a man, until she brings proof for her statement.","1353":"They saw her talking with someone in the marketplace, and they said to her, \u201cWhat sort of a man is he?\u201d   And she answered, \u201cHe is the so-and-so and he is a priest\u201d Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer say: she is believed, And Rabbi Joshua says: we do not live by her mouth, rather she is in the presumption of having had relations with a natin or a mamzer, until she brings proof for her statement.","1354":"She was pregnant and they said to her, \u201cWhat is the nature of this fetus?\u2019 And she answered, \u201cIt is from so-and-so and he is a priest.\u201d Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer say: she is believed, And Rabbi Joshua says: we do not live by her mouth, rather she is in the presumption of having had relations with a natin or a mamzer, until she brings proof for her statement.","1355":"Rabbi Yose said: it happened that a young girl went down to draw water from a spring and she was raped. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said: if most of the inhabitants of the town marry their daughters into the priesthood, this girl may also marry into the priesthood.","1356":"A woman became a widow or was divorced. She says, \u201cI was a virgin when you married me\u201d and he says, \u201cNot so, rather you were a widow when I married you\u201d, If there are witnesses that she went out with a hinuma, and with her head uncovered, her ketubah is two hundred zuz. Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka says: the distribution of roasted ears of corn is also evidence.","1357":"And Rabbi Joshua admits that, if one says to his fellow, \u201cThis field belonged to your father and I bought it from him\u201d, he is believed, for the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted. But if there are witnesses that it belonged to his father and he says, \u201cI bought it from him\u201d, he is not believed.","1358":"If witnesses said, \u201cThis is our handwriting, but we were forced, or we were minors, or we were disqualified witnesses\u201d they are believed. But if there are witnesses that it is their handwriting, or their handwriting comes out from another place, they are not believed.","1359":"If one witness says, \u201cThis is my handwriting and that is the handwriting of my fellow\u201d, and the other witness says, \u201cThis is my handwriting and that is the handwriting of my fellow\u201d, they are believed. If one says, \u201cThis is my handwriting\u201d and the other says, \u201cThis is my handwriting\u201d they must join to themselves another person, the words of Rabbi Judah Hanasi. But the Sages say: they need not join to themselves another person, rather a person is believed to say, \u201cthis is my handwriting.","1360":"If a woman says, \u201cI was married and I am divorced\u201d, she is believed, for the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted. But if there are witnesses that she was married, and she says, \u201cI am divorced\u201d, she is not believed. If she says, \u201cI was taken captive but I have remained clean\u201d, she is believed, for the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted. But if there are witnesses that she was taken captive and she says, \u201cI have remained clean\u201d she is not believed. But if the witnesses came after she had married, she shall not go out.","1361":"Two women were taken captive: one says, \u201cI was taken captive and I am pure\u201d, and the other one says, \u201cI was taken captive and I am pure\u201d-- they are not believed. But when they testify regarding one another, they are believed.","1362":"And likewise two men, if one says, \u201cI am a priest\u201d, and the other says, \u201cI am a priest\u201d, they are not believed. But when they testify about one another, they are believed.","1363":"Rabbi Judah says: one does not raise a person to the priesthood through the testimony of one witness. Rabbi Elazar says: When is this true?  When there are people who object; but when there are no people who object, one raises a person to the priesthood through the testimony of one witness. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon the son of the assistant chief of priests:  one raises a person to the priesthood through the testimony of one witness.","1364":"A woman was imprisoned by non-Jews: if for the sake of money, she is permitted to her husband, and if in order to take her life, she is forbidden to her husband. A town that has been conquered by siege-troops: all the priests\u2019 wives who are in it are prohibited from their husbands. If they have witnesses, even a slave, even a female slave, they are believed. However, no one is believed as to himself. Rabbi Zechariah ben Ha-katzav said: \u201cBy this temple! Her hand did not move out of my hand from the time that the non-Jews entered Jerusalem until they departed.\u201d They said to him: \u201cNo one may testify concerning himself.\u201d","1365":"The following are believed to testifying when they are grown-up about what they saw when they were minors:A person is believed to say \u201cThis is the handwriting of my father\u201d, \u201cThis is the handwriting of my teacher\u201d, \u201cThis is the handwriting of my brother\u201d; \u201cI remember that that woman went out with a hinuma and an uncovered head\u201d; \u201cThat that man used to go out from school to immerse in order to eat terumah\u201d; \u201cThat he used to take a share with us at the threshing floor\u201d; \u201cThat this place was a bet ha-peras\u201d; \u201cThat up to here we used to go on Shabbat\u201d; But a man is not believed when he says: \u201cSo-and-so had a path in this place\u201d; \u201cThat man had a place of standing up and eulogy in this place\u201d.","1366":"These are girls to whom the fine is due:If one had intercourse with a mamzeret, a netinah, a Samaritan; Or with a convert, a captive, or a slave-woman, who was redeemed, converted, or freed when she was under the age of  three years and one day. If one had intercourse with his sister, with the sister of his father, with the sister of his mother, with the sister of his wife, with the wife of his brother, with the wife of the brother of his father, or with a woman during menstruation, he has to pay the fine,   for although these are punishable through kareth, there is not, with regard to them, a death penalty inflicted by the court.","1367":"And in the following cases there is no fine:If a man had intercourse with a female convert, a female captive or a slave-woman, who was redeemed, converted or freed after the age of three years and a day. Rabbi Judah says:  a female captive who was redeemed is considered to be in her state of holiness even if she is of majority age. A man who had intercourse with his daughter, his daughter's daughter, his son's daughter, his wife's daughter, her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter does not pay the fine, because he forfeits his life, for his death is in the hands of the court, and he who forfeits his life pays no monetary fine for it is said, \u201cAnd yet no other damage ensues he shall be fined\u201d (Exodus 21:2.","1368":"A girl who was betrothed and then divorced Rabbi Yose the Galilean says:  she does not receive a fine. Rabbi Akiva says: she receives the fine and the fine belongs to her.","1369":"The seducer pays three forms of compensation and the rapist four. The seducer pays compensation for embarrassment and blemish and the fine; The rapist pays an additional form of compensation in that he pays for the pain. What is the difference between the penalties of a seducer and those of a rapist? The rapist pays compensation for the pain but the seducer does not pay compensation for the pain. The rapist pays immediately but the seducer pays only if he dismisses her. The rapist must \u201cdrink out of his pot\u201d but the seducer may dismiss the girl if he wishes.","1370":"What is meant by \u201che must drink out of his pot\u201d?Even if she is lame, even if she is blind and even if she is afflicted with boils he may not dismiss her. If she was found to have committed a licentious act or was unfit to marry an Israelite he may not continue to live with her, for it is said, \u201cAnd she shall be for him a wife\u201da wife that is fit for him.","1371":"An orphan who was betrothed and then divorced Rabbi Elazar says that one who seduces her is exempt but one who rapes her is liable to pay the fine.","1372":"How is the compensation that is paid for embarrassment reckoned? It all depends on the status of the offender and the offended. How is the compensation that is paid for blemish reckoned? She is regarded as if she were a slave to be sold in the market place and it is estimated how much she was worth then and how much she is worth now. The fine is the same for all. And any sum that is fixed in the Torah remains the same for all.","1373":"Wherever there is the right of sale there is a fine and wherever there is a fine there is no right of sale. In the case of a minor there is the right of sale and there is no fine; In the case of a young woman there is a fine but no right of sale. In the case of a girl who has reached majority age there is no right of sale and there is no fine.","1374":"He who declares, \u201cI seduced the daughter of so-and-so\u201d must pay compensation for embarrassment and blemish on his own admission but need not pay the fine. He who declares, \u201cI have stolen\u201d must make restitution for the principal on his own evidence but need not repay double,  fourfold  or fivefold. He who declares, \u201cMy ox has killed so-and-so\u201d or \u201cthe ox of so-and-so\u201d must make restitution on his own evidence. If he said \u201cMy ox has killed the slave of so-and-so\u201d he need not make restitution on his own evidence. This is the general rule: whoever pays more than the actual cost of the damage he has done need not pay it on his own evidence.","1375":"If a young girl was seduced the compensation for her embarrassment and blemish and the fine belong to her father; and the compensation for pain in the case of one who was raped. If the girl\u2019s case was tried before her father died all the forms of compensation are her father\u2019s. If her father subsequently died they are her brothers\u2019. If her father died before her case was tried they are hers. If her case was tried before she became of majority age all forms of compensation are her father\u2019s. If her father subsequently died they are her brothers\u2019. If she became of majority age before her case was tried they are hers. Rabbi Shimon says if her father died before she could collect the payments they belong to her. Her handiwork and anything she finds, even if she had not collected the proceeds belong to her brothers if her father died.","1376":"If a man gave his daughter in betrothal and she was divorced, and then he gave her again in betrothal and she was widowed, her ketubah belongs to him. If he gave her in marriage and she was divorced and then he gave her again in marriage and she was left a widow, her ketubah belongs to her. Rabbi Judah said: the first belongs to her father. They said to him: as soon as he gives her in marriage, her father loses all control over her.","1377":"The daughter of a convert who converted together with her mother and then committed an act of fornication is subject to the penalty of strangulation. She is not stoned at the door of her father\u2019s house nor does her husband pay the hundred sela\u2019. If she was conceived in unholiness but her birth was in holiness she is subject to the penalty of stoning. She is not stoned at the door of her father\u2019s house nor does her husband pay the hundred sela\u2019. If she was both conceived and born in holiness she is regarded as a daughter of Israel in all respects. A girl who has a father but no door of her father\u2019s house; or a door of her father\u2019s house but no father, is subject to the penalty of stoning the verse did not state \u201cthe opening of her father\u2019s house\u201d except as a precept.","1378":"A father has authority over his daughter in her betrothal whether it was effected by money, document or intercourse. He is entitled to anything she finds, to her handiwork and to annul her vows. He receives her get but he has no usufruct from her property during her lifetime. When she marries, the husband surpasses him in his rights in that he has usufruct during her lifetime. And he is obligated to feed her, to pay a ransom for her and to provide for her burial. Rabbi Judah says: even the poorest man in Israel must provide no less than two flutes and one lamenting woman.","1379":"She remains in the domain of her father until she enters the domain of her husband by going into the bridal chamber at marriage. If her father delivered her to the agents of the husband she passes into the domain of her husband. If her father went with the husband\u2019s agents or if the father\u2019s agents went with the husband\u2019s agents she remains in the domain of her father. If her father\u2019s agents delivered her to the husband\u2019s agents she passes into the domain of her husband.","1380":"A father is not obligated to maintain his daughter. This exposition was made by Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah in front of the sages in the vineyard of Yavneh:   \u201cThe sons shall inherit their mother\u2019s kethubah and the daughters shall be maintained out of their father\u2019s estate\u201d just as the sons do not inherit except after the death of their father, so the daughters are not maintained except after the death of their father.","1381":"If he did not write a kethubah for her, a virgin still collects two hundred zuz and a widow one mane, because it is a condition laid down by court. If he assigned to her in writing a field that was worth one mane instead of the two hundred zuz and did not write for her, \u201cAll property that I possess is a lien for your ketubah\u201d, he is liable for the full amount because it is a condition laid down by the court.","1382":"If he did not write for her, \u201cif you are taken captive I will ransom you and take you again as my wife\u201d, or in the case of a priest\u2019s wife, \u201cI will restore you to your people\u201d, he is liable to carry out these obligations, because it is a condition laid down by court.","1383":"If she was taken captive he is obligated to ransom her; And if he said, \u201cHere is her get and her ketubah, let her ransom herself\u201d, he is not allowed to act accordingly. If she was injured it is his duty to provide for her medical treatment; And if he said, \u201cHere is her get and her ketubah, let her heal herself\u201d, he is allowed to act accordingly.","1384":"If he did not write for her, \u201cThe male children that will be born from our marriage   shall inherit the money of your ketubah over and above their shares with their brothers\u201d, he is nevertheless liable, because this clause is a condition laid down by the court.","1385":"If he did not write for her, \u201cthe female children that I will have from you will dwell in my house and be maintained out of my estate until they are taken in marriage\u201d, he is nevertheless liable, because this clause is a condition laid down by the court.","1386":"If he did not write for her, \u201cYou shall live in my house and be maintained from my estate throughout the duration of your widowhood\u201d, he is nevertheless liable, because this clause is a condition laid down by the court. Thus did the men of Jerusalem write. The men of Galilee wrote as did the men of Jerusalem. The men of Judea used to write: \u201cUntil the heirs wish to pay you your ketubah\u201d. Therefore if the heirs wish to, they may pay her her ketubah and dismiss her.","1387":"Although the Sages have said:  a virgin collects two hundred and a widow one maneh, if he wishes to add, even a hundred maneh, he may do so.After betrothal but before marriage, a virgin collects two hundred zuz and a widow only one maneh, for the man wrote her the additional amount in order to marry her. If she was widowed or divorced, either after betrothal or after marriage, she is entitled to collect the entire amount. Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah says: a woman widowed or divorced after marriage receives the entire amount; Rabbi Judah says: if he wishes he may write for a virgin a document for two hundred zuz and she writes \u201cI have received from you a maneh\u201d, or for a widow he may write a document for a maneh and she writes, \u201cI have received from you fifty zuz\u201d. Rabbi Meir says: Any man who gives a virgin less than two hundred zuz or a widow less than a maneh is engaging in licentious sex.","1388":"A virgin is given twelve months from the time her intended husband claimed her, in which to prepare herself for marriage. Just as such a period is given to the woman, so is it given to the man to prepare himself. A widow is given thirty days. If the time has come and they were not married they are entitled to receive maintenance from the man\u2019s estate and if he is a priest they may eat terumah. Rabbi Tarfon says: They give her all of her food in terumah. Rabbi Akiva says: One half unconsecrated food and one half terumah.","1389":"A yavam who is a priest does not allow his sister-in-law to eat terumah. If she had spent six months waiting for her husband and six months waiting for the yavam, or even if she spent all of them waiting for her husband less one day waiting for the yavam, or all of them waiting for the yavam less one day waiting for her husband, she may not eat terumah. This was the ruling according to the first mishnah. The court that followed afterwards ruled: a woman may not eat terumah until she has entered the bridal chamber.","1390":"If a man consecrated his wife\u2019s handiwork, she continues to work and to consume that which she makes. Concerning the surplus: Rabbi Meir says: it is consecrated. Rabbi Yohanan Hasandlar says: it is unconsecrated.","1391":"The following are the kinds of work which a woman must perform for her husband: Grinding, Baking, If she brought one slave-woman into the marriage she need not grind or bake or wash. Washing, Rabbi Eliezer says: even if she brought him a hundred slave-women he may compel her to work in wool; for idleness leads to unchastity. Cooking, Nursing her child, Preparing his bed, And working in wool. If she brought two slave-women, she need not cook or nurse her child. If three, she need not prepare his bed or work in wool. If four, she may lounge in an easy chair. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says: if a man forbade his wife under a vow to do any work he must divorce her and give her kethubah to her for idleness leads to insanity.","1392":"A man forbade himself by vow from having intercourse with his wife: Beth Shammai says:  two weeks; Beth Hillel says: one week. Students may go away to study Torah, without the permission of their wives for a period of thirty days; workers for one week. The times for conjugal duty prescribed in the torah are: For independent men, every day; For workers, twice a week; For donkey-drivers, once a week; For camel-drivers, once in thirty days; For sailors, once in six months. These are the words of Rabbi Eliezer.","1393":"If a wife rebels against her husband her ketubah is reduced by seven denarii a week. Rabbi Judah says: seven tropaics. How long does he continue to reduce? Until the amount of her ketubah. Rabbi Yose says: he may continue to reduce, and if she receives an inheritance he may collect from it. Similarly, if a husband rebels against his wife, an addition of three denarii a week is made to her ketubah. Rabbi Judah said: three tropaics.","1394":"If a man provides for his wife through an agent, he must give her every week not less than two kavs of wheat or four kavs of barley. Rabbi Yose said: only Rabbi Ishmael, who lived near Edom, granted her a supply of barley. He must also give her half a kav of pulse and half a log of oil; and a kav of dried figs or a maneh of pressed figs, and if he has no such fruit he must supply her with a corresponding quantity of other fruit. He must also provide her with a bed, a mattress and a mat. He must also give her a hat for her head and a girdle for her loins; shoes, from festival to festival; and clothing worth fifty zuz every year. She is not to be given new clothes in the summer or worn-out clothes in the winter, but must be given clothes worth fifty zuz during the winter, and she wears them when they are worn-out during the summer; and the worn-out clothes remain her property.","1395":"He must also give her every week a silver ma'ah for her other needs and she is to eat with him every Friday eve. If he does not give her a silver ma'ah for her other needs, her handiwork belongs to her. And what is the quantity of work that she must do for him? The weight of five sela\u2019s of warp in Judea, which amounts to ten sela's in Galilee,   or the weight of ten sela's of woof in Judea, which amounts to twenty sela's in Galilee.   If she was nursing, her handiwork is reduced and her maintenance is increased. All this applies to a poor person in Israel, but in the case of a more respectable husband all is fixed according to his dignity.","1396":"A wife\u2019s find and her handiwork belong to her husband. And concerning her inheritance:  He has the usufruct during her lifetime. Any compensation for an embarrassment or blemish that may have been inflicted upon her belongs to her. Rabbi Judah ben Batera says: if the embarrassment or blemish was inflicted upon her on a hidden place on her body she receives two-thirds while he receives one-third; if on an open place on her body  he receives two-thirds and she receives one-third. His share is to be given to him immediately, but with hers land is to be bought and he enjoys the usufruct.","1397":"If a man agreed to give a fixed sum of money to his son-in-law and his son-in-law died:  the Sages say that he may say \u201cI was willing to give to your brother but I am unwilling to give to you.\u201d","1398":"If a woman agreed to bring her husband one thousand denarii he must agree to give her a corresponding sum of fifteen maneh. As a corresponding sum for appraised goods, he agrees to give one-fifth less. If a husband is requested to enter in his wife's ketubah \u201cgoods assessed at one maneh\u201d, and these are in fact worth a maneh, he only must agree to a maneh. Otherwise, if he is requested to enter in the ketubah: \u201cgoods assessed at a maneh\u201d, his wife must give him thirty-one sela and a denar, and if \u201cat four hundred\u201d, she must give him goods valued at five hundred. Whatever a bridegroom agrees to give his wife in her ketubah he writes one fifth less than the appraised value.","1399":"If a woman agreed to bring him cash, every sela\u2019 counts as six denarii. The bridegroom must accept upon himself to give his wife ten denarii for her perfume basket for call maneh which she brings as dowry. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel said: in all matters the local usage shall be followed.","1400":"If a man gives his daughter in marriage without specifying any conditions, he must give her not less than fifty zuz. If the father cut a deal with the husband that he would take her naked i.e. without a dowry, the husband may not say \u201cWhen I have taken her into my house I shall clothe her with clothes of my own\u201d, rather he must provide her with clothing while she is still in her father\u2019s house. Similarly if an orphan is given in marriage she must be given not less than fifty zuz. If charity funds are available she is to be provided in accordance with the dignity of her position.","1401":"If an orphan was given in marriage by her mother or her brothers with her consent and they gave her a dowry of a hundred, or fifty zuz, she may, when she reaches majority age, legally claim from them the amount that was due to her. Rabbi Judah says: if the father had given his first daughter in marriage, the second must receive as much as the first. The Sages say: sometimes a man is poor and becomes rich or rich and becomes poor.   Rather the estate should evaluated and the appropriate amount given to her.","1402":"If a man deposited a sum of money with an agent for his daugher, and after she was betrothed she says, \u201cI trust my husband\u201d, the trustee must act in accordance with the condition of his trust, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says: were the trust a field and she wished to sell it, it would be as if it was sold immediately! To whom does this apply?  To a daughter who has reached majority age, but in the case of a minor, there is no validity at all to the act of a minor.","1403":"If a man forbade his wife by vow to have any benefit from him, for thirty days, he may appoint a provider, but if for a longer period he must divorce her and give her the ketubah. Rabbi Judah ruled: if he was an Israelite he may keep her as his wife, if the vow was for one month, but must divorce her and give her the ketubah if it was for two months. If he was a priest he may keep her as his wife, if the vow was for two months, but must divorce her and give her the ketubah if it was for three.","1404":"If a man forbade his wife by vow from tasting any kind of produce he must divorce her and give her the ketubah. Rabbi Judah ruled: if he was an Israelite he may keep her as his wife, if the vow was for one day, but must divorce her and give her the ketubah if it was for two days. If he was a priest he may keep her as his wife, if the vow was for two days, but must divorce her and give her the ketubah if it was for three.","1405":"If a man forbade his wife by vow that she should not adorn herself with any type of adornment he must divorce her and give her the ketubah. Rabbi Yose says: this refers to poor women if no time limit is given, and to rich women if the time limit is thirty days.","1406":"If a man forbade his wife by vow that she may not go to her father\u2019s house: --When the father lives with her in the same town, the husband may retain her as his wife, if the prohibition was for one month; but if for two months he must divorce her and give her the ketubah. --When the father lives in another town, the husband may retain her as his wife, if the prohibition was for one festival, but if for three festivals, he must divorce her and give her the ketubah.","1407":"If a man forbade his wife by vow from visiting a house of mourning or a house of feasting, he must divorce her and give her the ketubah, because he has closed peoples doors against her. If he claims that his vow was due to some other cause he is permitted to forbid her. If he said to her: \u201cThere shall be no prohibition provided you tell so-and-so what you have told me\u201d or \u201cwhat I have told you\u201d or \u201cthat you will fill and pour out in the garbage\u201d, he must divorce her and give her the ketubah.","1408":"These leave their marriage without their ketubah: A wife who transgresses the law of Moses or Jewish law. And what is the law of Moses? Feeding her husband with untithed food, having intercourse with him while in the period of her menstruation, not separating dough offering, or making vows and not fulfilling them. And what is Jewish practice? Going out with her head uncovered, spinning wool in the marketplace or conversing with every man. Abba Shaul says: also one who curses her husband\u2019s parents in his presence. Rabbi Tarfon says: also one who has a loud voice. And who is regarded as one who has a loud voice? A woman whose voice can be heard by her neighbors when she speaks inside her house.","1409":"If a man betrothed a woman on condition that she was under no vows and she was found to be under vows, she is not betrothed. If he married her without making any conditions and she was found to be under vows, she leaves without her ketubah. If a woman was betrothed on condition that she has no bodily defects, and she was found to have defects, she is not betrothed. If he married her without making any conditions and she was found to have defects, she leaves without her ketubah. All defects which disqualify priests also disqualify women.","1410":"If she had bodily defects while she was still in her father\u2019s house, her father must produce proof that these defects arose after she had been betrothed and that consequently it was the husband\u2019s field that was flooded. If she was brought into her husband\u2019s domain, and the defects were discovered there the husband must produce proof that these defects existed before she had been betrothed and that consequently his bargain was made in error the words of Rabbi Meir. The Sages say:  To what does this apply? Only to concealed defects; but with regard to defects that are exposed he cannot make any claim. And if there was a bath-house in the town he cannot make any claim even about concealed defects, because he is assumed to have had her examined by his female relatives.","1411":"A man in whom defects have arisen after marriage cannot be forced to divorce his wife. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said: To what does this apply: to minor defects, but with regard to major defects he can be forced to divorce her.","1412":"These are the ones who are forced to divorce their wives: one who is afflicted with boils, one who has a polypus, a gatherer of dog feces for the treatment of hides, a coppersmith or a tanner whether they were in such a condition before they married or whether they arose after they had married. And concerning all these Rabbi Meir said: although the man made a condition with her that she accept him despite these defects she may nevertheless say, \u201cI thought I could accept him, but now I cannot accept him.\u201d The Sages say: she must accept such a person against her will, the only exception being a man afflicted with boils, because she by her intercourse will enervate him. It once happened at Sidon that a tanner died, and he had a brother who was also a tanner. The Sages said:  she may say, \u201cI was able to accept your brother but I cannot accept you.\u201d","1413":"If a woman came into the possession of property before she was betrothed, Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel agree that she may sell it or give it away and her act is legally valid. If she came into the possession of property after she was betrothed, Bet Shammai says: she may sell it, and Beth Hillel says: she may not sell it. Both agree that if she had sold it or given it away her act is legally valid. Rabbi Judah said: they argued before Rabban Gamaliel, \u201cSince the man acquires the woman does he not also acquire her property?\u201d If she came into the possession of property after she was married, both agree that, even if she had sold it or given it away, the husband may seize it from the buyers. If she came into possession before she married and then she married, Rabban Gamaliel says: if she sold it or gave it away her act is legally valid. Rabbi Hanina ben Akavya said: they argued before Rabban Gamaliel, \u201cSince the man acquires the woman does he not also gain acquires her property?\u201d He replied, \u201cWe are embarrassed with regard to her new possessions and you wish to roll over on us her old ones as well?\u201d","1414":"Rabbi Shimon distinguishes between one kind of property and another: Property that is known to the husband the wife may not sell, and if she has sold it or given it away her act is void; Property which is unknown to the husband she may not sell, but if she has sold it or given it away her act is legally valid.","1415":"If a married woman came into the possession of money, land should be bought with the money and the husband is entitled to the usufruct. If she came into the possession of produce that was detached from the ground,   land should be bought and the husband is entitled to the usufruct. If it was produce attached to the ground Rabbi Meir says, the land is to be valued as to how much it is worth with the produce and how much without the produce, and with the difference land should be bought and the husband is entitled to the usufruct. The Sages say: produce attached to the ground belongs to the husband and produced detached from it belongs to the wife; with the proceeds from the latter land should be bought and the husband is entitled to the usufruct.","1416":"Rabbi Shimon says: In respect to that in which the husband is at an advantage when he marries his wife he is at a disadvantage when he divorces her and in respect to that in which he is at a disadvantage when he marries her he is at an advantage when he divorces her. Produce which is attached to the ground is the husband\u2019s when he marries his wife and hers when he divorces her, Produce that is detached from the ground is hers when she marries but the husband\u2019s when she is divorced.","1417":"If she inherited old slaves or female slaves, they are to be sold, and land purchased with the proceeds, and the husband can enjoy the usufruct. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  she need not sell them, because they are the glory of her father\u2019s house. If she inherited old olive-trees or vines they must be sold, and land purchased with the proceeds, and the husband can enjoy the usufruct. Rabbi Judah says: she need not sell them, because they are the glory of her paternal house. He who spent money in connection with his wife\u2019s property, whether he spent much and consumed little, or spent little and consumed much, what he has spent he has spent, and what he has consumed he has consumed. If he spent but did not consume he may take an oath as to how much he has spent and receive compensation.","1418":"If a woman awaiting yibbum came into possession of money: Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel agree that she may sell it or give it away, and that her act is legally valid. If she dies, what shall be done with her ketubah and with property that comes in and goes out with her? Beth Shammai says: the heirs of her husband are to share it with the heirs of her father; Beth Hillel says: the property is to remain with those in whose possession it is, the ketubah is to remain in the possession of the heirs of the husband and the property which comes in and goes out with her remains in the possession of the heirs of her father.","1419":"If his brother left money, land shall be bought with it and he enjoys the usufruct.Rabbi Meir says, the land is to be valued as to how much it is worth with the produce and how much without the produce, and with the difference land should be bought and the husband is entitled to the usufruct. If the his brother left produce that was detached from the ground, land shall be bought out of the proceeds and he enjoys the usufruct.The Sages say: produce attached to the ground belongs to the husband but that which is detached from the ground belongs to the first person who takes it: If it was produce attached to the ground: If he seized it first he acquires ownership; and if she seized it first land shall be bought with it and he enjoys the usufruct. If he married her she is his wife in every respect save that her ketubah remains a debt on her first husband\u2019s estate.","1420":"He cannot say to her, \u201cBehold your ketubah lies on the table\u2019, rather all of his property has on it a lien from her kethubah. So too, a man may not say to his wife, behold your ketubah lies on the table, but all of his property has on it a lien from her ketubah. If he divorced her she is entitled only to her ketubah. If he remarried her she is like all other wives, and is entitled only to her ketubah.","1421":"If a husband writes to his wife, \u201cI have no claim whatsoever upon your property\u201d, he may enjoy its usufruct during her lifetime and, when she dies, he is her heir. If so, why might he have written to her, \u201cI have no claim whatsoever upon your property\u201d?That if she sold it or gave it away her act is valid. If he wrote, \u201cI have no claim whatsoever upon your property and upon their produce\u201d, he may not enjoy their usufruct during her lifetime but, when she dies, he inherits her. Rabbi Judah says: he may in all cases enjoy the usufruct from the usufruct unless he wrote to her:  \u201cI have no claim whatsoever upon your property and upon its produce and the produce of its produce and so on without end.\u201d If he wrote, \u201cI have no claim whatsoever upon your property, its produce and the produce of its produce during your lifetime and after your death\u201d, he may neither enjoy it produce during her lifetime nor does he inherit her when she dies. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  when she dies he inherits her because by his declaration he is making a condition which is contrary to what is written in the Torah and whenever a man makes a condition which is contrary to what is written in the Torah, his condition is null and void.","1422":"A man died and left a wife, a creditor, and heirs and he also had a deposit or a loan in the possession of others: Rabbi Tarfon says:  It shall be given to the one who is under the greatest disadvantage. Rabbi Akiva says: We do not show mercy in a matter of law.  Rather it shall be given to the heirs, for whereas all the others must take an oath the heirs need not take any oath.","1423":"If he left produce that was detached from the ground, whoever seizes it first acquires possession. If the wife took possession of more than the amount of her ketubah, or a creditor of more than the value of his debt, the balance: Rabbi Tarfon says: it should be given to the one who is under the greatest disadvantage. Rabbi Akiva says: we do not show mercy in a matter of law.  Rather it shall be given to the heirs, for whereas all the others must take an oath the heirs need not take any oath.","1424":"If a husband set up his wife as a shopkeeper or appointed her guardian he may impose upon her an oath whenever he wants. Rabbi Eliezer said:  even in respect of her spindle and her dough.","1425":"If he wrote to her (his wife), \u201cI have no claim upon you for either a vow   or an oath\u201d, he cannot make her swear an oath. However, he may make her heirs and upon those who have done business with her swear an oath. If he wrote, \u201cI have no claim upon you for either a vow or an oath nor upon your heirs nor upon those who have done business with you\u201d, he may not impose an oath either upon her or upon her heirs or upon those who have done business with you. However his heirs may impose an oath upon her or upon her heirs or upon those who have done business with her. If he wrote \u201cNeither I nor my heirs nor those who have done business with me shall have any claim upon you or upon your heirs or upon those who have done business with you for either a vow or an oath\u201d, neither he nor his heirs nor those who have done business with him may impose an oath either upon her or upon her heirs or upon those who have done business with her.","1426":"If she went from her husband\u2019s grave to her father\u2019s house, or returned to her father-in-law\u2019s house but was not made a guardian, the heirs may not make her swear an oath. But if she was made a guardian the heirs may make her swear an oath in respect of her administration during the subsequent period but not in respect of the past.","1427":"A woman who impairs her kethubah is not paid except by an oath. If one witness testifies against her that her kethubah has been paid, she is not be paid except by an oath. From the property of orphans, from property with a lien on it and from the property of an husband who is not present she is not paid except by an oath.","1428":"\u201cA woman who impairs her kethubah\u201d: How is this so? If her ketubah was for a thousand zuz and her husband said to her, \u201cYou have already received your kethubah\u201d, and she says, \u201cI received only a maneh\u201d, she is not paid the balance except by an oath. \u201cIf one witness testifies against her that her kethubah has been paid\u201d:  How is this so? If her ketubah was for a thousand zuz and her husband said to her, \u201cYou have already received your ketubah\u201d, and she says, \u201cI have not received it\u201d and one witness testifies against her that the ketubah has been paid, she is not paid except by an oath. \u201cFrom property with a lien on it\u201d:  How is this so? He had sold his property to others and she seeks to recover payment from the buyers, she is not paid except by an oath. \u201cFrom the property of orphans\u201d:  How is this so? He died and left his estate to his orphans and she seeks to recover payment from the orphans, she is not paid except by an oath. \u201cAn husband who is not present\u201d How is this so? If her husband went to a country beyond the sea and she seeks to recover payment in his absence, she is not paid except by an oath. Rabbi Shimon says: whenever she claims her ketubah the heirs may impose an oath upon her but whenever she does not claim her ketubah the heirs can not impose an oath upon her.","1429":"If she produced a get without a ketubah, she collects her kethubah. If she produced her ketubah without a get, and she says, \u201cMy get was lost\u201d, and he says, \u201cMy receipt was lost\u201d, and also a creditor who produced a debt document that was unaccompanied by a prosbul, these are not paid back. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says: from the time of danger a woman collects her ketubah with out a get and a creditor collects his debt without a prosbul. A woman who produced two letters of divorce and two ketuboth collects two kethuboth. Two kethuboth and one get or one kethubah and two gittin, or a kethubah, a get and evidence of her husband\u2019s death, she collects one kethubah only, for a man who divorces his wife and then remarries her contracts his second marriage on the condition of the first kethubah. A minor whose his father had given him in marriage, the ketubah of his wife is valid,  since it is on this condition that he kept her as his wife. A convert who converted with his wife, the kethubah remains valid, since it is on this condition that he kept her as his wife.","1430":"If a man was married to two wives and died, the first wife takes precedence over the second, and the heirs of the first wife take precedence over the heirs of the second. If he married a first wife and she died and then he married a second wife and he died, the second wife and her heirs take precedence over the heirs of the first wife.","1431":"If a man was married to two wives and they died, and subsequently he died, and the orphans of one of the wives claim their mother\u2019s kethubah and there is only enough for the two kethuboth,all the orphans they divide it equally. If there was a surplus of at least one dinar, these take their mother\u2019s ketubah and these take their mothers ketubah. If the orphans of one of the wives says, \u201cWe are raising the estate of our father by a denar more than the total amount of the kethuboth\u201d, in order that they can take their mother's kethubah, they are not listened to, rather the estate is evaluated by the court.","1432":"If there was property that would soon belong to the estate, it is not regarded as property held in possession. Rabbi Shimon says: even if there was movable property it is not regarded unless there was real estate worth one denar more than the total amount of the two kethuboth.","1433":"If a man who was married to three wives died, and the kethubah of one was a maneh, and of the other two hundred zuz, and of the third three hundred zuz and the estate was worth only one maneh they divide it equally. If the estate was worth two hundred zuz the woman whose ketubah is a maneh receives fifty zuz and the woman whose ketubah was two hundred and the woman whose ketubah was three hundred receive each three gold denarii (=seventy-five. If the estate was worth three hundred zuz, the woman whose ketubah was a maneh receives fifty zuz  and the woman whose ketubah was two hundred receives a maneh  and the woman whose ketubah was worth three hundred receives six gold denarii (=one hundred and fifty. Similarly, if three persons contributed to a joint fund and the fund lost or gained they share in the same manner.","1434":"If a man who was married to four wives died, his first wife takes precedence over the second, the second over the third and the third over the fourth. The first must take an oath to the second, the second to the third, and the third to the fourth, and the fourth recovers payment without an oath. Ben Nannus says:  Should she be rewarded because she is the last? She too may not exact payment except by an oath. If all were issued on the same day then the woman whose kethubah preceded that of the other, even if only by one hour, gets her ketubah first. And so it was the custom in Jerusalem to write the hours. If all kethuboth were issued at the same hour and the estate is worth no more than a maneh, they divide it equally.","1435":"If a man who was married to two wives sold his field, and the first wife wrote to the buyer, \u201cI have no claim whatsoever upon you\u201d, the second wife may take the field away from the buyer, and the first wife from the second, and the buyer from the first wife; and so they go on in turn until they arrange a compromise between them. The same law applies also to a creditor and to a woman creditor.","1436":"A widow is to be maintained out of the estate of her husband's orphans and, her handiwork belongs to them but it is not their obligation to bury her. Her heirs, who inherit her ketubah, are obligated to bury her.","1437":"A widow, whether her husband died after betrothal or after marriage may sell her husband's estate without permission from a court. Rabbi Shimon says: If her husband died after marriage she may sell without permission from a court, but if after betrothal, she may not sell except with permission from a court, since she is not entitled to maintenance, and anyone who is not entitled to maintenance may not sell except with permission from a court.","1438":"A widow who sold her ketubah or part of it; or pledged her ketubah or part of it; or gave it away to someone else or part of it, may not sell her husband\u2019s property in order to receive the remainder of her ketubah except with the permission of a court. But the Sages say: she may sell the land pledged for her kethubah even in four or five installments.  And meanwhile she may sell of her husband\u2019s estate to provide for her maintenance without the permission of the court, and she writes, \u201cI sold the land to provide for my maintenance\u201d. A divorced woman must not sell her husband\u2019s property except with the permission of the court.","1439":"If a widow whose ketubah was two hundred zuz sold land worth a maneh for two hundred zuz or land worth two hundred zuz for one maneh, she has received her ketubah. If her kethubah was one maneh, and she sold land worth a maneh and a denar\u2019 for one maneh, her sale is void. Even if she says, \u201cI will return the denar to the heirs\u201d, her sale is void. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says: her sale is always valid unless there was so much land there as to allow her to leave a field of nine kab, and from a garden an area of half a kab, or, according to Rabbi Akiba, a quarter of a kab. If her ketubah was four hundred zuz and she sold land to three persons, to each for one maneh, and to a fourth she sold what was worth a maneh and a denar for one maneh, the sale to the last person is void but the sale to all the others are valid.","1440":"If an assessment of the judges was one sixth less, or one sixth more than the actual value of the property their sale is void. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: their sale is valid for, otherwise, of what advantage is the power of a court? But if they made a bill for inspection, their sale is valid even if they sold for two hundred zuz what was worth one maneh or for one maneh what was worth two hundred zuz.","1441":"A minor who refused her husband, a secondary incest prohibition, or an aylonit is not entitled to a ketubah or to the usufruct of her dowry or to maintenance, or to the worn-out articles of her dowry. If from the outset he had married on the understanding that she is an aylonit she is entitled to a ketubah. A widow who was married to a high priest, a divorced woman or a halutzah who was married to a regular priest, a mamzereth or a netinah who was married to an Israelite, or the daughter of an Israelite who was married to a Natin or a mamzer is entitled to a ketubah.","1442":"If a man married a woman and she cut a deal with him that he should maintain her daughter for five years, he must maintain her for five years. If she was subsequently married to another man and cut a deal with him as well that he should maintain her daughter for five years, he must maintain her for five years. The first husband may not plead, \u201cIf she will come to me I will maintain her\u201d, rather he must send her maintenance to her at the place where her mother lives. Similarly, the two husbands cannot plead, \u201cWe will maintain her jointly\u201d, but one must maintain her and the other give her the cost of her maintenance.","1443":"If she married, her husband must supply her with maintenance and they give her the cost of her maintenance. If they die, their daughters are maintained out of their free assets only but she must be maintained even out of assigned property, because she is like a creditor. Clever men used to write, \u201cOn condition that I shall maintain your daughter for five years while you are with me\u201d.","1444":"A widow who says, \u201cI do not want to move from my husband\u2019s house\u201d, the heirs cannot tell her, \u201cGo to your father\u2019s house and we will maintain you\u201d, rather they must maintain her in her husband\u2019s house and they give her a residence according to her honor. If she said, \u201cI have no desire to move from my father\u2019s house\u201d, the heirs can say to her, \u201cIf you stay with us you will have your maintenance, but if you do not stay with us you will receive no maintenance\u201d. If she claimed that she didn\u2019t want to live there because she is young and they are young, they must maintain her while she lives in the house of her father.","1445":"As long as she lives in her father\u2019s house she may collect her kethubah at any time. As long as she lives in her husband\u2019s house she may recover her ketubah, only within twenty-five years, because in the course of twenty-five years she has sufficient opportunities to give favors equal in value to the amount of her ketubah, the words of Rabbi Meir who spoke in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel. The Sages say:  as long as she lives in her husband\u2019s house she may collect her ketubah at any time. As long as she lives in her father\u2019s house she may collect her ketubah only within twenty-five years. If the widow died, her heirs must mention her ketubah within twenty-five years.","1446":"There were two judges of fines in Jerusalem, Admon and Hanan ben Avishalom. Hanan stated two rulings and Admon stated seven. If a man went to a country beyond the sea and his wife claimed maintenance: Hanan says: she must take an oath at the end but not at the beginning. The sons of the high priests differed from him and ruled that she must take an oath both at the beginning and at the end. Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas agreed with their ruling. Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai said: Hanan has spoken well; she need take an oath only at the end.","1447":"If a man went to a country beyond the sea and someone came forward and financially supported his wife, Hanan says: he lost his money. The sons of the high priests differed from him and said: let him take an oath as to how much he spent and recover it. Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas agreed with their ruling. Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai said: Hanan has spoken well the man put his money on the horn of a deer.","1448":"Admon said seven rulings:If a man dies and leaves sons and daughters, if the estate is large, the sons inherit it and the daughters are maintained from it. And if the estate is small, the daughters are maintained from it, and the sons can go begging. Admon said, \u201cJust because I\u2019m a male I lose out!\u201d Rabban Gamaliel said; I agree with the words of Admon.","1449":"If he claims from his neighbor jars of oil, and he admits his claim to the empty jars, Admon says, since he admits to him a portion of the claim, he must swear. But the Sages say: the admission is not of the same kind as the claim. Rabban Gamaliel said:  I agree with the words of Admon.","1450":"If a man promised a money to his prospective son-in-law and then defaulted, his daughter shall sit until her hair turns white. Admon says:  She may say, \u201cHad I myself promised the sum I would sit until my hair turns white, but now that my father has promised it, what can I do? Either marry me or set me free.\u201d Rabban Gamaliel said:  I agree with the words of Admon.","1451":"If a man contests the ownership of a field and he has signed as a witness on its deed of sale, Admon says:  He can say, \u201cLitigation with the second is easier for me, since the first is a more difficult person than he\u201d. But the Sages say:  He lost his right. If the protester made it a boundary mark when selling an adjacent piece of land to another person he has lost his right to protest.","1452":"If a man went to a country beyond the sea and in his absence the path to his field was lost, Admon ruled: let him walk to his field by the shortest way. But the Sages say: let him purchase a path for himself even if it costs him a hundred maneh or let him fly through the air.","1453":"If a man produced a debt document against another, and the latter produced a deed of sale showing that the former had sold him a field,  Admon ruled: The other can say, had I owed you anything you should have been paid pack when you sold me the field\u201d. But the Sages say: This seller was clever, since he may have sold him the land in order to be able to take it from him as a pledge.","1454":"If two men produced debt documents against one another, Admon says; the holder of the later document can say to the other, \u201cHad I owed you any money how is it that you borrowed from me?\u201d But the Sages say: This one collects his debt and this one collects his debt.","1455":"The following regions are regarded as three countries in respect of marriage:   Judaea, Transjordan and Galilee. A husband may not take out his wife with him from one town to another or from one city to an other. But within the same country he may take her out with him from one town into another town or from one city into an other city, but not from a town to a city nor from a city to a town. A man may take out his wife with him from an inferior to a superior dwelling, but not from a superior to an inferior dwelling. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says: not even from an inferior dwelling to a superior dwelling, because the change to a superior dwelling tests.","1456":"Everyone may compel their spouse  to go up to the land of Israel, but none may compel their spouse to leave. Everyone may compel their spouse  to go up to Jerusalem, but none may compel their spouse  to leave. The same is true for both men and women and slaves. If a man married a woman in the land of Israel and divorced her in the land of Israel, he must pay her her ketubah in the currency of the land of Israel. If he married a woman in the land of Israel and divorced her in Cappadocia he must pay her her ketubah in the currency of the land of Israel. If he married a woman in Cappadocia and divorced her in the land of Israel, he must a gain pay her ketubah in the currency of the land of Israel. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says that he must pay her her ketubah in the Cappadocian currency.","1457":"A woman is acquired in three ways and acquires herself in two: She is acquired by money, by document, or by intercourse. \u201cBy money\u201d: Bet Shammai says:  a denar or the equivalent of a denar; Bet Hillel says: a perutah or the equivalent of a perutah. And how much is a perutah? An eighth of an Italian issar. And she acquires herself by divorce or by her husband's death. A yevamah  is acquired by intercourse. And she acquires herself by halitzah or by the yavam\u2019s death.","1458":"A Hebrew slave is acquired by money and by document; And acquires himself by years, by Jubilee, and by deduction from the purchase price. A Hebrew maidservant is greater in that she acquires herself by \u2018signs of physical maturity\u2019. He whose ear is bored is acquired by boring, and acquires himself by Jubilee or his master's death.","1459":"A Canaanite slave is acquired by money, deed, or by possession, And acquires himself by money through the agency of others, and by document through his own agency, the words of Rabbi Meir. The Sages say: by money, through his own agency, and by document, through the agency of others, providing that the money comes from others.","1460":"Large animals are acquired by being handed over and small animals by lifting, the words of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Elazar. The sages say: small animals are acquired by being led.","1461":"Property which has security is acquired by money, by deed or by possession. Property which does not have security is acquired only by being drawn to the purchaser. Property which does not have security may be acquired in conjunction with property which does have security by money, deed, or possession; And it obligates the property which provides security, to take an oath concerning them.","1462":"Whatever can be used as payment for another object, as soon as this one takes possession of the object, the other one assumes liability for what is given in exchange. How so? If one exchanges an ox for a cow, or a donkey for an ox, as soon as this one takes possession, the other one assumes liability for what is given in exchange. The sanctuary\u2019s title to property is acquired by money; the title of an ordinary person to property by hazakah. Dedication to the sanctuary is equal to delivery to an ordinary person.","1463":"All obligations of the son upon the father, men are obligated, but women are exempt. But all obligations of the father upon the son, both men and women are obligated. All positive, time-bound commandments, men are obligated and women are exempt. But all positive non-time-bound commandments both men and women are obligated. And all negative commandments, whether time-bound or not time-bound, both men and women are obligated, except for, the prohibition against rounding the corners of the head, and the prohibition against marring the corner of the beard, and the prohibition for a priest to become impure through contact with the dead.","1464":"The rites of laying hands, waving, presenting the meal-offering, taking the handful, burning the fat, cutting the neck of bird sacrifices, sprinkling and receiving the blood are performed by men but not by women, except the meal-offering of a sotah and a female nazirite, where they themselves wave the offering.","1465":"Every commandment which is dependent on the land is practiced only in the land of Israel; and every commandment which is not dependent on the land is practiced both in and outside the land, except orlah and kilayim. Rabbi Elazar says:  also the prohibition of new produce.","1466":"He who performs one commandment is rewarded, his days are prolonged, and he inherits the land, But he who does not perform one commandment, is not rewarded, his days are not prolonged, and he does not inherit the land. He who is familiar with Bible, Mishnah, and the ways of the land will not easily sin, as it is said, \u201cAnd a threefold cord is not quickly broken\u201d (Ecclesiastes 4:12. But he who is not familiar with Bible, Mishnah and the ways of the land does not belong to civilization.","1467":"A man can betroth a woman through himself or through his agent. A woman may be betrothed through herself or through her agent. A man may give his daughter in betrothal when a young girl either himself or through his agent. He who says to a woman, \u201cBe betrothed to me with this date, be betrothed to me with this one\u201d   if any one of them is worth a perutah, she is betrothed; if not, she is not betrothed. If he says, \u201cBe betrothed to me with this one and with this one and with this one\u201d   if together they are worth a perutah, she is betrothed; if not, she is not betrothed. If she eats them one by one, she is not betrothed unless one of them is worth a perutah.","1468":"If a man says to a woman, \u201cBe betrothed to me with this cup of wine,\u201d and it is found to be of honey, or \u201cof honey\u201d and it is found to be of wine; \u201cwith this silver denar,\u201d and it is found to be of gold, or \u201cof gold\u201d and it is found to be of silver; \u201con condition that I am wealthy,\u201d and he is found to be poor, or \u201cpoor\u201d and he is found to be rich, she is not betrothed. Rabbi Shimon says: if he deceives her to her advantage, she is betrothed.","1469":"\u201cBe betrothed to me on condition that I am a priest,\u201d and he is found to be a Levite, or \u201ca Levite\u201d and he is found to be a priest; \u201ca natin,\u201d and he is found to be a mamzer, or \u201ca mamzer\u201d and he is found to be a natin; \u201ca townsman,\u201d and he is found to be a villager, or \u201ca villager\u201d and he is found to be a townsman; \u201con condition that my house is near the bathhouse,\u201d and it is found to be far, or \u201cfar\u201d and it is found to be near; \u201con condition that I have a daughter or maidservant that braids hair\u201d and he does not have, \u201cor on condition that I do not have\u201d, and he has; \u201con condition that I have no sons\u201d, and he has, or \u201con condition that I have sons, and he does not have --in all these cases, even if she declares, \u201cIn my heart I would have agreed to be betrothed to him in any case,\u201d she is not betrothed. Similarly if she deceives him.","1470":"If he says to his agent, \u201cGo out and betroth to me so-and-so in such and such a place,\u201d and he goes and betroths her elsewhere, she is not betrothed. \u201cShe is in such and such a place,\u201d and he betroths her elsewhere, she is betrothed.","1471":"If a man betrothed a woman on condition that she was under no vows and she was found to be under vows, she is not betrothed. If he married her without making any conditions and she was found to be under vows, she leaves without her ketubah. If a woman was betrothed on condition that she has no bodily defects, and she was found to have defects, she is not betrothed. If he married her without making any conditions and she was found to have defects, she leaves without her ketubah. All defects which disqualify priests also disqualify women.","1472":"If he betroths two women with the value of a perutah, or one woman with less than the value of a perutah, even if he subsequently sends gifts, she is not betrothed, because he sent them on account of the first kiddushin. The same is true if a minor betroths.","1473":"If one betroths a woman and her daughter or a woman and her sister at one time,   they are not betrothed. And it once happened that five women, among whom were two sisters, that a man gathered a basket of figs, which was theirs, and which was of the seventh year, and he said, \u201cBehold, you are betrothed to me with this basket,\u201d and one accepted it on behalf of them all and the sages said: the sisters are not betrothed.","1474":"If he a priest betroths a woman with his portion, whether it is of higher holiness or of lower holiness, she is not betrothed. If one betroths with second tithe, whether unwittingly or deliberately, he has not betrothed her: the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: if unwittingly, he has not betrothed her; if deliberately, he has betrothed her. If with sanctified property, if deliberately, he has betrothed her; if unwittingly, he has not betrothed her, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: if unwittingly, he has betrothed her; if deliberately, he has not betrothed her.","1475":"If he betroths a woman with orlah, or kilayim of the vineyard, or an ox condemned to be stoned, or the heifer whose neck is to be broken, or a leper\u2019s bird-offerings, or a nazirite\u2019s hair, or the first-born of a donkey, or meat boiled in milk, or non-sacred meat slaughtered in the Temple court, she is not betrothed. If he sells them and betroths her with the proceeds, she is betrothed.","1476":"If he betroths with terumot, tithes, priestly gifts, the water of purification or the ashes of purification behold she is betrothed, even if he is an Israelite.","1477":"If he says to his fellow, \u201cGo out and betroth me such-and-such a woman,\u201d and he goes and betroths her to himself, she is betrothed. Similarly, if he says to a woman, \u201cBe betrothed to me after thirty days,\u201d and another comes and betroths her within the thirty days, she is betrothed to the second, and in such cases an Israelite\u2019s daughter betrothed to a priest may eat terumah. But if he says, \u201cBe betrothed to me from now and after thirty days,\u201d and another comes and betroths her within the thirty days, she is betrothed and not betrothed to both:   and in such cases an Israelite\u2019s daughter betrothed to a priest, or a priest\u2019s daughter betrothed to an Israelite, may not eat terumah.","1478":"If one says to a woman. \u201cBehold, you are betrothed to me on condition that I give you two hundred zuz,\u201d she is betrothed, and he must give it. \u201cOn condition that I give you two hundred zuz within thirty days from now\u201d: if he gives her within thirty days, she is betrothed; if not, she is not betrothed. \u201cOn condition that I have two hundred zuz,\u201d she is betrothed, providing he has two hundred zuz. \u201cOn condition that I show you two hundred zuz,\u201d she is betrothed, and he must show her. But if he shows her money lying on the table, she is not betrothed.","1479":"If he says to her \u201cBe betrothed to me on condition that I own a bet kor of land\u201d,   she is betrothed, providing he does own it. \u201cOn condition that I own it in such and such a place\u201d, if he owns it there she is betrothed, but if not she is not betrothed. \u201cOn condition that I show you a bet kor of land,\u201d she is betrothed, providing that he does show it to her.

Rabbi Hanina ben Gamaliel says: the matter had to be stated, for had it not been stated it would have implied that even in Canaan they should not inherit.","1481":"If he betroths a woman and then declares, \u201cI thought that she was a priest\u2019s daughter, and behold she is the daughter of a Levite\u201d or \u201ca Levite\u2019s daughter whereas she is the daughter of a priest\u201d; \u201cPoor, whereas she is wealthy\u201d, or \u201cwealthy, whereas she is poor,\u201d she is betrothed, since she did not deceive him. If he says to a woman, \u201cBehold, you are betrothed to me after I convert,\u201d or \u201cafter you convert,\u201d \u201cAfter I am freed from slavery,\u201d or \u201cafter you are freed from slavery\u201d; \u201cAfter your husband dies\u201d or, \u201cafter your sister dies\u201d; \u201cAfter your yavam performs halizah for you\u201d; she is not betrothed. Similarly, if he says to his friend, \u201cIf your wife gives birth to a female, behold she is betrothed to me,\u201d she is not betrothed. If his wife is pregnant, and her fetus is discernible, his words are valid, and if she bears a female, she is betrothed.","1482":"If he says to a woman, \u201cBehold you are betrothed to me on condition that I speak to the government on your behalf\u201d, or \u201cThat I work for you as a laborer\u201d, if he speaks to the government on her behalf or works for her as a laborer, she is betrothed; if not, she is not betrothed. If he says, \u201cBehold you are betrothed to me on condition that my father consents,\u201d if his father consents, she is betrothed; if not, she is not betrothed. If his father dies, she is betrothed; if the son dies, the father is instructed to say that he does not consent.","1483":"If a father declares, \u201cI have given my daughter in betrothal, but do not know to whom I have betrothed her,\u201d and then a man comes and states, \u201cI betrothed her,\u201d he is believed. If one says, \u201cI betrothed her,\u201d and another man says, \u201cI betrothed her,\u201d both must give a get; but if they want, one may give a get and the other marry her.","1484":"If a man declares \u201cI have given my daughter in betrothal,\u201d or \u201cI gave her in betrothal and divorced her while she was still a minor,\u201d and she is now a minor, he is believed. \u201cI gave her in betrothal and divorced her while she was still a minor,\u201d and she is now of majority age, he is not believed. \u201cShe was taken captive and I redeemed her,\u201d whether she is a minor or of majority age he is not believed. If a man declares at the time of his death \u201cI have sons,\u201d he is believed; \u201cI have brothers,\u201d he is not believed. If one betroths his daughter without specifying which, the daughters of majority age are not included.","1485":"If one has two groups of daughters by two wives, and he declares, \u201cI have given in betrothal my eldest daughter, but I do not know whether the eldest of the seniors or the eldest of the juniors, or the youngest of the seniors who is older than the eldest of the juniors,\u201d all are forbidden to marry other men, except the youngest of the juniors, the words of Rabbi Meir.

If she says, \u201cYou betrothed me,\u201d and he says, \u201cI did not betroth you,\u201d he is permitted to her relatives but she is prohibited to his relatives. \u201cI betrothed you,\u201d and she says, \u201cYou betrothed my daughter,\u201d he is forbidden to the relatives of the senior the mother, but the senior is permitted to his relatives; he is permitted to the junior\u2019s the daughter\u2019s relatives, and the junior is permitted to his relatives.","1487":"If a man says to a woman, \u201cI betrothed your daughter,\u201d and she replies, \u201cYou betrothed me\u201d; he is forbidden to the junior\u2019s the daughter\u2019s relatives, while the junior is permitted to his relatives; he is permitted to the senior\u2019s mother\u2019s relatives, while the senior is forbidden to his relatives.","1488":"Wherever there is kiddushin and there is no transgression, the child goes after the status of the male. And what case is this?  When the daughter of a priest, a Levite or an Israelite is married to a priest, a Levite or an Israelite. And wherever there is kiddushin and there is transgression, the child goes after the status of the flawed parent. And what case is this?  When a widow is married to a high priest, or a divorced woman or a halutzah to an ordinary priest, or a mamzeret or a netinah to an Israelite, and the daughter of an Israelite to a mamzer or a natin. And any woman who cannot contract kiddushin with that particular person but can contract kiddushin with another person, the child is a mamzer. And what case is this?  One who has intercourse with any relation prohibited in the Torah. And any woman who can not contract kiddushin with that particular person or with others, the child follows her status. And what case is this?  The child issue of a female slave or a gentile woman.","1489":"Rabbi Tarfon says: mamzerim can be purified. How is this so? If a mamzer marries a slave woman, her son is a slave; if he frees him, it is found that the son is a free man. Rabbi Eliezer says: behold, he is a slave mamzer.","1490":"Ten genealogical classes went up from Babylonia in the time of Ezra and Nehemiah:   Priests, Levites, Israelites, halalim, converts, freed slaves, mamzerim, netinim, hushlings and foundlings. Priests, Levites and Israelites may marry each other. Levites, Israelites, halalim, converts, and freed slaves may marry each other. Converts, freed slaves, mamzerim and netinim, hushlings and foundlings, may marry each other.","1491":"These are they: a hushling (shtuki): he who knows who his mother is but not his father; A foundling (asufi): he who was gathered in from the marketplace and knows neither his father nor his mother. Abba Saul used to call the hushling (shtuki), \u201cchecked one\u201d (b\u2019duki).","1492":"All who are forbidden to enter into the assembly may intermarry with each other. Rabbi Judah forbids it. Rabbi Elazar says: those who are certain may marry those who are certain, but those who are certain with those who are doubtful and those who are doubtful with those who are certain and those who are doubtful with others who are doubtful this is prohibited. Who are \u201cthose who are doubtful\u201d?  The shtuki, the asufi and the Samaritan.","1493":"He who marries a the daughter of a priest must investigate her lineage up to four mothers, which are eight:  her mother and her mother\u2019s mother, her mother\u2019s father\u2019s mother and her mother, her father\u2019s mother and her mother, her father\u2019s father\u2019s mother and her mother. In the case of the daughter of a Levite or an Israelite, one more is added.","1494":"They do not check from the altar and upwards, nor from the duchan dais and upwards, nor from the Sanhedrin and upwards. And all those whose fathers were established to have been among the public officers or charity collectors may marry their daughters into the priesthood, and he doesn\u2019t need to check after them. Rabbi Yose says: even one who was signed as a witness in the old court of Tzippori. Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: even one who was recorded in the king\u2019s list of officers.","1495":"The daughter of a male halal is unfit for the priesthood for all time. If an Israelite marries a halalah, his daughter is fit for the priesthood. If a halal marries the daughter of an Israelite, his daughter is unfit for the priesthood. Rabbi Judah says: the daughter of a male convert is as the daughter of a male halal.","1496":"Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: if an Israelite marries a female convert, his daughter is fit for the priesthood, and if a male convert marries the daughter of an Israelite, his daughter is fit for the priesthood. But if a male convert marries a female convert, his daughter is unfit for the priesthood.  The same law applies to a convert as to freed slaves, even for ten generations, his daughter is unfit unless his mother is of Israelite stock. Rabbi Yose says: even if a male convert marries a female convert, his daughter is fit for the priesthood.","1497":"If a man declares, \u201cthis son of mine is a mamzer,\u201d he is not believed. And even if both the husband and wife say about the fetus inside her, \u201cit\u2019s a mamzer\u201d they are not believed. Rabbi Judah says: they are believed.","1498":"If a man gives permission to his agent to give his daughter in betrothal, and then he himself goes and gives her in betrothal to another, if his betrothal was first, his betrothal is valid; if the agent\u2019s was first, his betrothal is valid. And if it is unknown, both must give her a divorce.  And if they wish, one gives a divorce, and the other marries her. Similarly, if a woman gives permission to her agent to give her in betrothal, and she goes and betroths herself to another: if her own preceded, her betrothal is valid; if her agent\u2019s preceded, his betrothal is valid. And if they do not know, both must give her a divorce.  And if they wish, one gives a divorce and the other marries her.","1499":"If a man went overseas together with his wife, and then he, his wife, and his children returned, and he said, \u201cBehold, this is she who went with me overseas, and these are her children\u201d, he need not bring proof with regard to the woman or the children. If he declares, \u201cShe died abroad and these are her children,\u201d he must bring proof with regard to the children, but not with regard to the woman.","1500":"If he says, \u201cI married a woman overseas, and behold, this is she, and these are her children\u201d, he must bring proof about the woman, but not about the children. If he says, \u201cShe died, and these are her children\u201d, he must bring proof about the woman and about the children.","1501":"A man may not be alone with two women, but one woman may be alone with two men. Rabbi Shimon says: even one man may be alone with two women, if his wife is with him, and he may sleep with them in an inn, because his wife watches him. A man may be alone with his mother and his daughter, and he may sleep with them in immediate bodily contact; but when they grow up, she must sleep in her garment and he in his.","1502":"An unmarried man must not learn to be a scribe, nor may a woman learn to be a scribe. Rabbi Elazar says: even one who has no wife should not learn to be a scribe.","1503":"Rabbi Judah said: an unmarried man must not tend cattle, nor may two unmarried men sleep together under the same cover.  But the sages permit it. One whose business is with women must not be alone with women.  And one should not teach his son a woman\u2019s trade. Rabbi Meir says: one should always teach his son a clean and easy profession, and pray to Him to whom wealth and property belong. For a profession does not contain the potential for poverty and wealth, for poverty is not due to one\u2019s profession nor is wealth due to the profession, but all depends on merit. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: have you ever seen a wild beast or a bird with a profession? Yet they are sustained without trouble. Now, were they not created only to serve me, while I was created to serve my master: surely then I should make a living without trouble! But my evil acts have done me in and withheld my livelihood. Abba Gurion a man of Sidon says in the name of Abba Guria: one should not teach his son to be a donkey-driver, camel-driver, wagon-driver, sailor, shepherd, or shopkeeper, because their profession is the profession of robbers. Rabbi Judah says in his name: most donkey-drivers are wicked, while most camel-drivers are worthy men; and most sailors are pious.   The best of doctors are destined for Gehenna, and the worthiest of butchers is Amalek\u2019s partner. Rabbi Nehorai says: I will abandon every profession in the world and I will not teach my son anything but Torah, for a person enjoys its reward in this world while the principal remains for him in the world to come. But all other professions are not so; for when a man comes to sickness or old age or suffering and cannot engage in his profession, he must die of starvation, whereas the Torah is not so, for it guards him from all evil in his youth and gives him a future and hope in his old age. Of his youth what is said? \u201cBut they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength\u201d (Isaiah 40:31). Of his old age what is said? \u201cThey shall still bring forth fruit in old age\u201d (Psalms 92:15).  And it is also said of our father Abraham, \u201cAnd Abraham was old \u2026 And the Lord blessed Abraham with everything\u201d (Genesis 24:1).  We find that Abraham our father observed the whole Torah before it was given, for it is said, \u201cBecause Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws\u201d (Genesis 26:5).","1504":"All the substitutes for vows have the validity of vows. If one says, \u201cI shall be one\u201d he is a nazirite. \u201cI shall be comely\u201d, he is a nazirite. \u201cA nazik\u201d, \u201ca naziah\u201d, \u201ca paziah\u201d, he is a nazirite.

If one says \u201cBehold, I shall bring birds as offerings\u201d Rabbi Meir says he is a nazirite, but the sages say he is not a nazirite.","1505":"If one says, \u201cBehold I am a nazir to abstain from grape seeds, or from grape skins, or from shaving, or from contracting ritual defilement,\u201d he is a nazirite and all the regulations of naziriteship apply to him. If one says, \u201cBehold, I shall be like Samson\u201d, \u201clike the son of Manoah\u201d, \u201clike the husband of Delilah, or \u201clike the one who uprooted the doors of Gaza,\u201d or \u201clike the one whose eyes the Philistines put out,\u201d he is a nazirite like Samson. What difference is there between a nazirite like Samson and a life-nazirite? A life-nazirite if his hair becomes burdensome, he may thin it with a razor and then offer three animal sacrifices. If he should he be ritually defiled, he must offer the sacrifice prescribed for defilement. The nazirite like Samson if his hair becomes burdensome, he may not thin it. And if he becomes ritually defiled, he does not offer the sacrifice prescribed for defilement.","1506":"A nazirite vow of unspecified duration is for thirty days. If one says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite for one long period\u201d, or \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite for one short period\u201d, or even if he says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite for as long as it takes to go from here to the end of the earth,\u201d he is a nazirite for thirty days. If one says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite, plus one day,\u201d or \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite, plus one hour,\u201d or \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite, once and a half,\u201d he becomes a nazirite for two periods of naziriteship. If one says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite for thirty days plus an hour,\u201d he becomes a nazirite for thirty-one days, since there is no naziriteship for hours.","1507":"If one says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite as the hairs of my head\u201d, or \u201cAs the dust of the earth\u201d, or \u201cAs the sands of the sea,\u201d he becomes a life-nazirite, and shaves his head every thirty days. Rabbi says: this one does not shave his head every thirty days. The one who shave his head every thirty days is the one who says, \u201cBehold, upon me are naziriteships as the hair on my head\u201d, or \u201cAs the dust of the earth\u201d, or \u201cAs the sands of the sea.\u201d","1508":"If he says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite as the capacity of this house\u201d, or \u201cas the capacity of this basket,\u201d we check him. If he says \u201cI vowed one long period of naziriteship\u201d, he becomes a nazirite for thirty days. But if he says \u201cI vowed without specification\u201d, we regard the basket as though it were full of mustard seed, and he becomes a nazirite for life.","1509":"If one says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite, as long as it takes to get from here to such and such a place,\u201d we estimate the number of days journey from here to the place mentioned. If this is less than thirty days, he becomes a nazirite for thirty days; Otherwise he becomes a nazirite for that number of days.","1510":"If one says, \u201cBehold I am a nazirite, as the number of days in a solar year\u201d he must count as many naziriteships as there are days in the solar year. Rabbi Judah said: such a case once occurred, and when the man had completed his naziriteships, he died.","1511":"If one says, \u201cBehold I am a nazirite and abstain from dried figs and pressed figs\u201d: Beth Shammai says: he is an ordinary nazirite. Beth Hillel says: he is not a nazirite. Rabbi Judah said: even though Beth Shammai did say that his formula is effective they meant only one who says, \u201cThey are forbidden to me, as is a sacrifice.\u201d","1512":"If one says, \u201cThis cow is saying \u2018Behold, I am a nazirite if I get up,\u201d or \u201cThis door is saying \u2018Behold, I am a nazirite if I open\u201d: Bet Shammai says:  he is a nazirite, But Bet Hillel says: he is not a nazirite. Rabbi Judah said: even though Beth Shammai did say that his formula is effective they meant only one who says, \u201cThis cow is forbidden to me, as is a sacrifice if it gets up.\u201d","1513":"If they mixed for him a cup of wine, and he said, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite in regard to it,\u201d he becomes a nazirite. It once happened that a woman was intoxicated and they mixed for her a cup of wine and she said, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite in regard to it.\u201d The sages ruled that she only meant to forbid it to herself as a sacrifice.","1514":"If one says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite, on condition that I can drink wine, or can have contact with the dead\u201d, he becomes a nazirite, and all these things are forbidden him. If he says, \u201cI knew that there is such a thing as naziriteship but I did not know that a nazirite is forbidden to drink wine\u201d, he is bound to his vow. Rabbi Shimon releases him. If he says, \u201cI knew that a nazirite is forbidden to drink wine,  but I imagined that the sages would give me permission, since I cannot do without wine\u201d, or \u201csince my profession is to bury the dead\u201d,  he is released. Rabbi Shimon binds him to his vow.","1515":"If one says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite and I take it upon myself to bring the hair offering of another nazirite\u201d,  and his friend heard and said \u201cI too, and I take it upon myself to bring the hair offering of another nazirite\u201d, then, if they are clever they will bring the other\u2019s hair offering; otherwise they must bring hair offerings on behalf of other nazirites.","1516":"If one says, \u201cI take it upon myself to bring the hair offering of half of another nazirite,\u201d  and his friend heard and said, \u201cI too take it upon myself to bring the hair offering of half of another nazirite,\u201d \u2013, this one brings a full hair offering and this one brings a full hair offering, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say: each brings half a hair offering.","1517":"If one says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite when I shall have a son,\u201d and son is born to him, he becomes a nazirite. If the child is a daughter, or a tumtum, or an hermaphrodite, he does not become a nazirite. If he said, \u201cWhen I shall have a child,\u201d then even if it is a daughter, or a tumtum, or an hermaphrodite, he becomes a nazirite.","1518":"If his wife miscarries, he does not become a nazirite. Rabbi Shimon says: in this case he should say, \u201cIf it was a viable child, behold, I am a nazirite from obligation; otherwise behold, I am a voluntary nazirite.\u201d If his wife later bears a child, he then becomes a nazirite. Rabbi Shimon says: he should say, \u201cIf the first was a viable child, the first naziriteship was obligatory, and this one is voluntary; otherwise, the first one was voluntary, and the present one is obligatory.\u201d","1519":"If one says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite now and a nazirite when I shall have a son\u201d, and begins to count his own naziriteship and then a son is born to him, he completes his own naziriteship and then counts the one on account of his son. If one says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite when I shall have a son, and a nazirite on my own account\u201d, and begins to count his own naziriteship and then a son is born to him, he interrupts his own naziriteship, counts the one on account of his son, and then complete his own.","1520":"If one says \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite when I shall have a son, and I will be a nazirite for one hundred days on my own account,\u201d:  if a son was born to him before the expiration of seventy days, he loses none of this period;  but if after seventy days, it voids anything over the seventy days, since there can be no shaving for a period of less than thirty days.","1521":"If one says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite,\u201d he shaves on the thirty-first day. If he shaved on the thirtieth day, he has fulfilled his obligation. If, however, he says \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite for thirty days,\u201d and shaves on the thirtieth day, he has not fulfilled his obligation.","1522":"If a man vows two naziriteships, he shaves for the first one on the thirty-first day, and for the second on the sixty-first day. If he shaved for the first on the thirtieth day, he can shave for the second on the sixtieth day. If he shaved on the day before the sixtieth, he has fulfilled his obligation. For this was the testimony that Rabbi Papias testified concerning one who vows two naziriteships, that if he shaved for the first on the thirtieth day, he is to shave for the second on the sixtieth day.  And if he shaved on the day before the sixtieth day, he has fulfilled his obligation, the thirtieth day counting towards the required number.","1523":"If one says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite,\u201d and becomes impure on the thirtieth day, he renders void the whole period. Rabbi Eliezer says: only seven days are void. If one says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite for thirty days\u201d, and becomes impure on the thirtieth day, then he renders void the whole period.","1524":"If he says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite for one hundred days,\u201d and becomes impure on the hundredth day, he renders void the whole period. Rabbi Eliezer says: only thirty days are void. If he becomes impure on the hundred and first day, thirty days are void. Rabbi Eliezer says: only seven days are void.","1525":"If one takes a nazirite vow while in a graveyard, then even if he remains there for thirty days, these do not count, and he does not have to bring the sacrifice prescribed for impurity. If he leaves it and re-enters, the period  counts, and he must bring the sacrifice prescribed for impurity. Rabbi Eliezer says: not if he re-enters on the same day, for it says, \u201cBut the former days shall be void,\u201d  until there are former days.","1526":"If one vows a long naziriteship of and completes his naziriteship and afterwards comes to the land of Israel: Beth Shammai says that he is a nazirite for thirty days, But Beth Hillel says that his naziriteship begins again. It happened that Queen Helena, when her son went to war, said: \u201cIf my son returns in peace from the war, I shall be a nazirite for seven years.\u201d  Her son returned from the war, and she was a nazirite for seven years. At the end of the seven years, she went up to the land of Israel and Beth Hillel instructed her to be a nazirite for a further seven years. Towards the end of this seven years, she contracted ritual defilement, and so altogether she was a nazirite for twenty-one years. Rabbi Judah said: she was a nazirite only for fourteen years.","1527":"One who has two sets of witnesses testifying about him:  one says that he vowed two naziriteships and the other that he vowed five: Beth Shammai says: the evidence is conflicting, and there is no naziriteship at all. But Beth Hillel says:  \u201cfive\u201d includes \u201ctwo\u201d, so that he becomes a nazirite for two naziriteships.","1528":"One who said, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite\u201d, and his friend overheard and said \u201cI too,\u201d and another one said \u201cI too\u201d, all are nazirites. If the first one is released from his vow, all are released. If the last one is released, he alone is released, and the others remain bound by their vows. If he said, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite\u201d, and his companion overheard and said, \u201cMy mouth shall be as his mouth and my hair as his hair\u201d, he becomes a nazirite. If he said, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite,\u201d and his wife overheard and said, \u201cI too,\u201d he can annul her vow, but his own remains binding. If a woman says, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite\u201d, and her husband overhears and adds, \u201cI too,\u201d he cannot annul her vow.","1529":"If he says in conversation with his wife, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite. What about you?\u201d and she answers \u201cAmen,\u201d he can annul her vow, but his own remains binding. But if she should say, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite, what about you?\u201d and he answers, \u201cAmen,\u201d he cannot annul her vow.","1530":"If a woman takes a nazirite vow and then drinks wine or is defiled by a corpse, she receives forty lashes. If her husband annuls her vow and she did not know that he annulled it, and she drinks wine or is defiled by a corpse, she does not receive the forty lashes. Rabbi Judah says: even though she does not receive the forty lashes she should receive lashes for disobedience.","1531":"A woman takes a nazirite vow and sets aside the requisite animal for the sacrifice and then her husband subsequently annuls her vow: If the animal belonged to him, it can be put to pasture with the herd; If it belonged to her: the sin-offering is left to die, the burnt-offering is offered as an ordinary burnt-offering, and the peace-offering is offered as an ordinary peace-offering, and it may be eaten for one day only, and it does not require loaves of bread. If she has a lump sum of money set aside for the purchase of these sacrifices it is to be used for voluntary offerings; If she has specified money: The money for the sin-offering is to be taken to the Dead Sea, the use of it is forbidden, but the laws of sacrilege do not apply; The money for the burnt-offering they bring a burnt-offering, and the laws of sacrilege do apply; The money for the peace-offering they bring a peace-offering, and it may be eaten for one day only, and it does not require loaves of bread.","1532":"If one of the kinds of blood has been sprinkled on her behalf, the husband can no longer annul the vow. Rabbi Akiba says: even if one of the animals has been slaughtered on her behalf, he can no longer annul the vow. When is this true?  If she is shaving after observing the naziriteship in purity, but if she is shaving after ritual defilement, he can still annul the vow, because he can say, \u201cI do not want a disgraced woman.\u201d Rabbi says that he can annul her vow even if she is shaving after observing the naziriteship in purity, since he can say: \u201cI do not want a woman who is shaved.","1533":"A man may impose a nazirite vow on his son, but a woman cannot impose a nazirite vow on her son. How so? If the boy shaves himself or is shaved by his relatives, or if he protests or his relatives protest on his behalf, Then if the father had set aside an animal for the sacrifice: the sin-offering is left to die, the burnt-offering is offered as an ordinary burnt-offering, and the peace-offering is offered as an ordinary peace-offering, and it may be eaten for one day only, and it does not require loaves of bread. If he had a lump sum of money set aside for the purchase of these sacrifices it is to be used for voluntary offerings; If he had specified money: The money for the sin-offering is to be taken to the Dead Sea, the use of it is forbidden, but the laws of sacrilege do not apply; The money for the burnt-offering they bring a burnt-offering, and the laws of sacrilege do apply; The money for the peace-offering they bring a peace-offering, and it may be eaten for one day only, and it does not require loaves of bread.","1534":"A man can shave with offerings set aside for his father\u2019s naziriteship but a woman cannot shave with offerings set aside for her father\u2019s naziriteship. How so? If a man\u2019s father had been a nazirite, and had set apart a lump sum of money for the sacrifices of his naziriteship and died and the son said, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite on condition that I may shave with my father\u2019s money.\u201d Rabbi Yose said: this money is to be used for freewill-offerings, this man cannot  shave with offerings set aside for his father\u2019s naziriteship. Who is the one who can shave with offerings set aside for his father\u2019s naziriteship? He who was a nazirite together with his father, and whose father had set apart a lump sum of money for his nazirite sacrifices and died.  This one can shave with offerings set aside for his father\u2019s naziriteship.","1535":"Beth Shammai says: something consecrated in error is consecrated; But Beth Hillel says: it is not consecrated. How is this so? If someone says, \u201cThe black bull that leaves my house first shall be consecrated,\u201d and a white one comes out, Beth Shammai says: it is consecrated, But Beth Hillel says: it is not consecrated.","1536":"If he says, \u201cThe gold denar that comes into my hand first shall be consecrated\u201d, and a silver denar came to his hand: Beth Shammai says: it is consecrated, Beth Hillel says: it is not consecrated. If he says, \u201cThe cask of wine that comes into may hand first shall be consecrated,\u201d and a cask of oil came into his hand: Beth Shammai says: it is consecrated, Beth Hillel says: it is not consecrated.","1537":"If a man vowed to be a nazirite and then asked a sage to be released from his vow but the sage bound him to his vow he counts the naziriteship from the time that the vow was made. If he asked a sage to be released from his vow and he released him, if he had an animal set aside for a sacrifice, it goes forth to pasture with the rest of the herd. Beth Hillel said to Beth Shammai: do you not admit that here where the consecration is in error, the animal goes forth to pasture with the herd? Beth Shammai said to them: do you not admit that if a man in error calls the ninth animal, the tenth, or the tenth the ninth, or the eleventh the tenth, each is consecrated? Beth Hillel said to them: it is not the staff that makes these consecrated.  For suppose that by mistake he placed the staff upon the eighth or upon the twelfth, would this have any effect?  Rather Scripture which has consecrated the tenth, has also declared consecrated the ninth and the eleventh.","1538":"If one vowed to be a nazirite and went to bring his animal for the sacrifice and found that it had been stolen: If he had taken the nazirite vow before his animal was stolen, he is still a nazirite. But if he had taken the nazirite vow after his animal was stolen, he is not a nazirite. It was this mistake that Nahum the Mede made. When nazirites arrived in Jerusalem from the Diaspora and found the Temple destroyed, Nahum the Mede said to them, \u201cHad you known that the Temple would be destroyed, would you have become nazirites?\u201d They answered, no, and Nahum the Mede released them from their vow.  When the matter came before the sages they said to him: whoever vowed a nazirite vow before the destruction of the Temple is a nazirite, but if after the destruction of the temple, he is not a nazirite.","1539":"If people were walking along the road and saw someone coming towards them, and one said, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite if it is so-and-so,\u201d and the other said, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite if it is not so-and-so,\u201d and a third said, \u201cBehold I am a nazirite if one of you is a nazirite,\u201d and a fourth said, \u201cBehold I am a nazirite if neither of you is a nazirite,\u201d and a fifth said, \u201cBehold I am a nazirite if both of you are nazirites,\u201d and a sixth said, \u201cBehold I am a nazirite if all of you are nazirites\u201d: Beth Shammai says:  all of them are nazirites. Beth Hillel says only those whose words were not fulfilled are nazirites. Rabbi Tarfon says: not one of them is a nazirite.","1540":"If the person approaching turned around suddenly without being identified, he is not a nazirite. Rabbi Shimon says: he should say, \u201cIf it was as I said, behold I am a nazirite by obligation; and if not, behold I am a voluntary nazirite.\u201d","1541":"If he saw a koy and said, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite if this is a wild beast\u201d, and another \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite if that is not a wild beast,\u201d a third said \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite if that is a domesticated beast,\u201d and a fourth said, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite if that is not a domesticated beast,\u201d a fifth said, Behold, I am a nazirite if that is both a wild beast and a domesticated beast,\u201d and a sixth said, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite if that is neither a wild beast nor a domesticated beast\u201d and a seventh said, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite if one of you is a nazirite,\u201d and an eighth said, Behold, I am a nazirite if one of you is not a nazirite,\u201d and a ninth said, \u201cBehold, I am a nazirite if you are all nazirites\u201d, then all of them are nazirites.","1542":"Three things are forbidden to a nazirite:  ritual defilement, shaving, and products of the vine. All products of the vine join together to add up to a minimum measure, and he is not liable until he eats an olive\u2019s worth of grapes. According to the earlier mishnah, until he drinks a quarter of a log of wine. Rabbi Akiba says: even if he soaked his bread in wine and it is enough to make an olive\u2019s worth he is liable.","1543":"He is liable for wine on its own, for grapes on their own, for grape-skins on their own and for seeds on their own. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said: there is no penalty unless he eats two grape-skins and one seed. What are harzanim and what are zagim? Harzanim: those are the outer part, and the zagim are the inner part, according to Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Yose says:  that you may not err, think of the zug bell of an animal, the outer part is called the zug hood and the inner part the inbal clapper.","1544":"A nazirite vow of unspecified duration is for thirty days. If the nazirite shaved himself or bandits shaved him, it overturns thirty days. A nazirite who shaves himself, whether with scissors or a razor, or who singes the ends of his hair, even a minimal amount, is liable. A nazirite may shampoo his hair and part it with his fingers but may not comb it. Rabbi Ishmael says: he is not to cleanse it with dirt because it causes the hair to fall out.","1545":"A nazirite who drank wine all day long is liable for only a single penalty. If they said to him, \u201cdo not drink,\u201d \u201cdo not drink\u201d and he drank, he is liable for a penalty for each time they warned him. A nazirite who was shaving all day long is liable for only a single penalty. If they said to him, \u201cdo not shave,\u201d \u201cdo not shave\u201d and he shaved, he is liable for a penalty for each time they warned him. A nazirite who was defiling himself with the dead all day long is liable for only a single penalty. If they said to him, \u201cdo not be defiled,\u201d \u201cdo not be defiled\u201d and he was defiled, he is liable for a penalty for each time they warned him.","1546":"Three things are forbidden to a nazirite:   ritual defilement, shaving and products of the vine. Defilement and shaving have a stringency that products of the vine do not have, in that defilement and shaving annul the period of naziriteship already observed, whereas partaking of products of the vine does not do so. Products of the vine have a stringency that defilement or shaving do not have, in that products of the vine permit of no exception from the general prohibition, whereas defilement and shaving are allowed as exception from the general prohibition in the case where shaving is a religious duty, or where there is a neglected corpse. And defilement has a stringency that shaving does not have, in that defilement annuls the whole period of naziriteship already served, and a nazirite who is defiled is liable for a sacrifice, whereas shaving annuls only thirty days and he is not liable for a sacrifice.","1547":"Shaving on account of defilement:  How was it done? He would sprinkle with purification water on the third and seventh days, shave on the seventh day and bring his sacrifices on the eighth day. If he shaved on the eighth day, he would bring his sacrifices on that same day, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Tarfon said to him: what difference is there between this one and a person with scale disease? He said to him: the purification of this one depends on his days, whereas the purification of one with scale disease depends on his shaving, and he cannot bring a sacrifice unless the sun has set upon him after his purification.","1548":"Shaving in a case of purity:  How was it done?He would bring three animals, a sin-offering, a burnt-offering, and a well-being offering, slaughter the peace-offering and shave thereafter, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Elazar says: he shaves after the sin-offering, for in all cases the sacrifice of the sin-offering takes precedence. But if he shaved after the slaughter of any one of the three he has fulfilled his obligation.","1549":"Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: if he brought three animals without specifying what they were for, the one suitable for a sin offering is sacrificed as a sin offering, for a burnt offering as a burnt offering, and for a well-being offering as a well-being offering. He would then take the hair of his nazirite head and threw it under the cauldron. If he shaved in the province he also would throw it under the cauldron. With regard to what was this said? With regard to shaving in ritual purity, whereas in shaving after ritual defilement he does not throw it under the cauldron. Rabbi Meir says: all nazirites throw it under the cauldron, except for the defiled nazirite who shaved in the provinces.","1550":"He would then boil or completely boil the peace-offering. The priest then took the boiled shoulder of the ram, an unleavened cake from the basket, and an unleavened wafer, placed them on the nazirite\u2019s hands and waved them. After this, the nazirite was allowed to drink wine and defile himself for the dead. Rabbi Shimon says:  as soon as one kind of blood had been sprinkled on his behalf the nazirite could drink wine and defile himself for the dead.","1551":"If he shaves after one of the sacrifices and the sacrifice is found to be invalid, his shaving is invalid and his sacrifices do not count: If he shaves after the sin-offering, which was not offered for its correct designation and then he brought the other sacrifices under their correct designations, his shaving is invalid and none of his sacrifices counts for him. Similarly, if he shaves after the burnt-offering or the wellbeing offering, which have not been offered for their correct designation, and then he brought the other sacrifices under their correct designation, his shaving is invalid and none of his sacrifices counts for him. Rabbi Shimon says: that particular sacrifice does not count, but his other sacrifices do count. If he shaved after all three sacrifices and one of them was found to valid, his shaving is valid and he has only to bring the other sacrifices.","1552":"If a nazirite on whose behalf one kind of blood has been sprinkled becomes unclean, Rabbi Eliezer says: everything is annulled. But the Sages say: he should bring his remaining sacrifices after purification. They said to him: it happened that Miriam the Tadmorite had one kind of blood sprinkled on her behalf, and they came and told her that her daughter was dangerously ill. She went and found her dead and the sages told her to offer her remaining sacrifices after purification.","1553":"A high priest and a nazirite may not defile themselves with their dead relatives, but they may defile themselves with a neglected corpse. If they were walking on the path and found a neglected corpse: Rabbi Eliezer says: the high priest should defile himself but not the nazirite. But the Sages say: the nazirite should defile himself but not the high priest. Rabbi Eliezer said to them: the priest should defile himself, for he does not offer a sacrifice for his defilement,  and the nazirite should not defile himself, for he does offer a sacrifice on defilement. They said to him: the nazirite should defile himself, for his holiness is not permanent,  and the priest should not defile himself, for his holiness is permanent.","1554":"For which types of defilement must the nazirite shave?For defilement contracted from a corpse, or an olive\u2019s bulk of the flesh of a corpse, or an olive\u2019s bulk of corpse ooze, or a ladleful of corpse-mould; Or the spinal column, or the skull, or any limb severed from a corpse, or any limb severed from a living body that is still properly covered with flesh, or a half-kav of bones, or a half-log of blood. Whether the defilement was contracted from contact with them, from carrying them, or from overshadowing them. For defilement contracted from a barley-grain\u2019s bulk of bone, whether by contact or carrying. On account of these, a nazirite must shave and be sprinkled on the third and seventh days, and such defilement annuls the previously served period, and he does not begin to count a new naziriteship until he has become clean and brought his sacrifices.","1555":"But for defilement contracted by overhanging branches, or protruding stones, or a field that may have once been a cemetery, or land of the Gentiles, or the stone which covers the tomb or the supporting stone of a tomb, or a quarter-log of blood, or a tent, or a quarter-kav of bones, or utensils that have been in contact with a corpse, or on account of the days of counting after contracting scale disease or the days during which he is certified unclean because of scale disease; For all these the nazirite is not required to shave, but they do sprinkle him on the third and seventh days, and the defilement does not annul the formerly served period, and he begins to resume counting his naziriteship immediately after purification and there is no sacrifice. In fact they said: the days of defilement of a male or female sufferer from gonorrhea and the days that a leper is shut up as a leper count toward his naziriteship.","1556":"Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Joshua:  for every defilement conveyed by a corpse on account of which a nazirite must shave, people are liable for entering the sanctuary, and for every defilement conveyed by a corpse on account of which a nazirite does not shave, people are not liable for one entering the sanctuary. Rabbi Meir said: such defilement should not be less serious than defilement through a dead creeping thing. Rabbi Akiba said: I argued in the presence of Rabbi Eliezer:  Now if on account of a barley-corn\u2019s bulk of bone which does not defile a man by overshadowing, a nazirite shaves should he touch it or carry it, then surely a quarter-log of blood which defiles a man by overshadowing, should cause a nazirite to shave should he touch it or carry it? He replied: What is this Akiva! We do not make here an \u2018all the more so\u2019 argument. When I afterwards went and recounted these words to Rabbi Joshua, he said to me, \u201cYou spoke well, but thus they have ruled the halakhah.\u201d","1557":"Two nazirites to whom someone says, \u201cI saw one of you defiled, but I do not know which of you it was,\u201d Both must shave and together bring sacrifices for defilement and sacrifices for completing a naziriteship in purity, and one of them must say, \u201cIf I am unclean, the sacrifices for defilement are mine, and the sacrifices in purity are yours, whereas if I am the one who is clean, the sacrifices in purity are mine and the sacrifices for defilement are yours.\u201d And they must then count thirty more days and bring sacrifices in purity and one of them must say, \u201cIf I am the one who was unclean, the sacrifices for defilement were mine, the sacrifices in purity were yours, and these are my sacrifices in purity, whereas if I was the one who was clean, the sacrifices in purity were mine, the sacrifices for defilement were yours, and these are your sacrifices in purity.\u201d If one of them dies: Rabbi Joshua said that the other should request that someone from the marketplace take a nazirite vow together with him, and say: \u201cIf I am unclean, you are to be a nazirite immediately, but if I was clean, you are to become a nazirite at the end of thirty days.\u201d They then count thirty days and bring sacrifices for defilement and sacrifices for completing a naziriteship in purity and the first one says, \u201cIf I am the one who was unclean, the sacrifices for defilement are mine and the sacrifices in purity are yours, whereas if I am the one who is clean, the sacrifices in purity are mine and the sacrifices for defilement are sacrifices offered in doubt.\u201d They then count another thirty days and bring one set of the sacrifices in purity and the first one says, \u201cIf I am the one who was defiled, the sacrifice for defilement offered previously was mine and the sacrifice in purity was yours, and this is my sacrifice in purity, whereas if I was the one who was clean, the sacrifice in purity was mine and the sacrifice for defilement was offered in doubt and this is your sacrifice in purity.\u201d Ben Zoma said to him:  Who will listen to him and take a nazirite vow together with him? Rather he must bring a bird as a sin offering and an animal as a burnt offering and say, \u201cIf I was defiled, the sin offering is part of my obligation and the burnt offering is a voluntary offering, whereas if I remained clean, the burnt-offering is part of my obligation and the sin offering is a sacrifice offered in doubt.\u201d \u2018 He must then count thirty days and bring the sacrifices in purity and say, \u201cIf I was defiled, the former burnt offering was a voluntary offering and this is part of my obligation, whereas if I remained clean, the former burnt offering was part of my obligation and this is the voluntary one. And these are the rest of my sacrifices.\u201d Rabbi Joshua said: the result is that he brings his sacrifices half at a time! But the Sages agreed with Ben zoma.","1558":"A nazirite who was in doubt whether he had been defiled and in doubt whether he had been a confirmed leper, may eat consecrated food after sixty days, and drink wine and come into contact with the dead after one hundred and twenty days, since shaving on account of leprosy overrides the prohibition against the shaving of the nazirite only when the leprosy is certain, but when it is doubtful it does not override it.","1559":"Gentiles are not subject to the laws of naziriteship. Women and slaves are subject to the laws of naziriteship. The nazirite vow is more stringent in the case of women than in the case of slaves, for a man can compel his slave to break his vow but he cannot compel his wife to do so. The nazirite vow is more stringent in the case of slaves than in the case of women, for he can void the vows of his wife, but he cannot void the vows of his slaves. If he voids his wife\u2019s vow, it is void for ever, but if he voids his slave\u2019s vow, if the slave becomes free he must complete his naziriteship. When the slave passes from his master's presence: Rabbi Meir says: he may not drink wine. Rabbi Yose says: he may drink wine.","1560":"A nazirite shaves and then discovers that he was defiled: If the defilement was certain, it voids the naziriteship, But if it is a defilement of the depth, it is not rendered void. If he discovers that he was defiled before shaving, in either case it voids the naziriteship. How is the law regarding \u2018defilement of the depth\u2019? If he goes down into a cavern to bathe, and a corpse is found floating at the mouth of the cavern, he is definitely unclean. If it is found embedded in the floor of the cavern, Then if he went in merely to cool himself off he remains clean, But if he went to purify himself after defilement through contact with the dead he remains unclean, Because the assumption concerning an unclean person is that he is unclean and the assumption concerning a clean person is that he is clean,.","1561":"If a man finds a corpse for the first time lying in a typical position, he may remove it together with the soil that it occupies. If he finds two, he may remove them together with the ground they occupy. If he finds three, then if the distance between the first and the last is from four to eight cubits, this is a graveyard site. He must check from that point twenty cubits in all directions. If he finds one twenty cubits away, he must check from it another twenty cubits, for there are grounds that it is a graveyard. For if he had found it at the outset he would have removed it and the soil that it occupies.","1562":"Any matter of doubt regarding leprous affliction at the outset is clean before a decision is made to declare it unclean. Once a decision has been made to declare it unclean, any matter of doubt is regarded as unclean. A person suffering from gonorrhea (a is examined regarding seven things,   before it has been decided that it is gonorrhea: With regard to food, drink, carrying things, jumping, sickness, something seen, or an impure thought. Once gonorrhea is established, he is no longer examined. Any flux resulting from an accident to him, doubtful flux and his semen are unclean, for there are grounds for this assumption. If a one strikes his fellow, and they expected him to die and he partially recovered and then grew worse and died the other is liable for murder. Rabbi Nehemiah exempts him, for there are grounds for this assumption.","1563":"Samuel was a nazirite, according to the words of Rabbi Nehorai, as it says, \u201cAnd no razor morah shall come upon his head\u201d and it says with reference to Samuel, \u201cAnd no razor morah\u201d,  just as \u201crazor morah\u201d in the case of Samson teaches that he was a nazirite, so \u201crazor morah\u201d in the case of Samuel teaches that he was a nazirite. Rabbi Yose says: but does not \u201cmorah\u201d refer to fear of  flesh and blood? Rabbi Nehorai said to him: But does it not also say, \u201cAnd Samuel said; \u2018How can I go? If Saul will hear it he will kill me\u2019\u201d which shows that he was afraid of flesh and blood?","1564":"All the substitutes for vows have the validity of vows. Those for haramim have the validity of haramim, And those for oaths have the validity of oaths, And those for nazirite vows have the validity of nazirite vows. If one says to his fellow, \u201cI am forbidden from you by a vow\u201d; \u201cI am separated from you\u201d; \u201cI am distanced from you\u201d, \u201cthat I should eat from yours\u201d, \u201cthat I should taste from yours\u201d, he is prohibited. If he says: \u201cI am banned to you\u201d, Rabbi Akiba was inclined to rule stringently. If one says \u201cAs the vows of the wicked\u201d, he has vowed in respect of being a nazirite, or a sacrifice, or an oath. If he says \u201cAs the vows of the fit\u201d, he has said nothing. But if he said \u201cAs their freewill-offerings\u201d he has vowed in respect of being nazirite and a sacrifice.","1565":"One who says, \u201ckonam\u201d \u201cqonah\u201d or \u201cqonas\u201d: these are the substitutes for korban. \u201cHerek\u201d \u201cherech\u201d or \u201cheref,\u201d these are substitutes for herem. \u201cNazik\u201d \u201cnaziah\u201d \u201cpaziah\u201d these are substitutes for nazirite vows. \u201cShevuthah\u201d \u201cshekukah\u201d or one who vows with the word \u201cmota\u201d these are substitutes for shevuah (an oath).","1566":"If one says \u201cNot-unconsecrated food shall I not eat from you\u201d, \u201cNot fit\u201d, or \u201cNot pure\u201d, \u201cClean\u201d or \u201cUnclean\u201d, \u201cRemnant\u201d or \u201cPiggul he is bound by his vow. If one says, \u201cMay it be to me, as the lamb\u201d, \u201cAs the Temple pens\u201d, \u201cAs the wood on the altar\u201d, \u201cAs the fire on the altar\u201d, \u201cAs the altar\u201d, \u201cAs the Temple\u201d or \u201cAs Jerusalem\u201d; or if one vowed by reference to the altar utensils, even though he did not mention \u201ckorban\u201d, behold this one was vowed by a korban. Rabbi Judah said: He who says \u201cJerusalem\u201d has said nothing.","1567":"If one says \u201cA korban\u201d, \u201cA wholly burnt-offering\u201d, \u201cA meal-offering\u201d, \u201cA sin-offering\u201d, \u201cA thanksgiving-offering\u201d, \u201cA peace-offering, should be that which I eat from you\u201d   he is bound by his vow. Rabbi Judah permitted him. If he says \u201cThe korban\u201d, \u201clike a korban\u201d, \u201ckorban\u201d, should be that which I eat from you   he is bound by his vow. If he says, \u201cThat which I shall not eat of yours should be a korban\u201d, Rabbi Meir forbids him. If one says to his fellow, \u201cKonam be my mouth which speaks with you\u201d, \u201cMy hands which work for you\u201d or \u201cMy feet which walk with you,\u2019 he is forbidden.","1568":"And these vows are not binding: One who says \u201cWhat I eat of yours shall be unconsecrated\u201d; \u201cAs the flesh of the swine\u201d; \u201cAs an object of idolatrous worship\u201d;  \u201cAs hides pierced at the heart\u201d; \u201cAs carrion\u201d; \u201cAs terefoth\u201d; \u201cAs abominations\u201d; \u201cAs creeping things\u201d; \u201cAs Aaron\u2019s dough\u201d; \u201cAs his terumah\u201d--in all these cases the vow is not binding. If one says to his wife, \u201cBehold! You are like my mother to me\u201d, he must be given an opening on other grounds, in order that he should not act lightly in such matters. If one says, \u201cKonam if I sleep\u201d; \u201cIf I speak\u201d; or \u201cIf I walk\u201d;  or if one says to his wife, \u201cKonam if I cohabit with you,\u201d he is liable to the biblical prohibition \u201che shall not break his word\u201d (Numbers 30:. If he says, \u201cI swear an oath not to sleep\u201d, or, \u201ctalk,\u201d or, \u201cwalk,\u201d he is forbidden to do so.","1569":"If he says, \u201cA korban should be what I do not eat of yours\u201d; \u201cBy a korban! If I eat of yours\u201d; \u201cWhat I do not eat of yours should not be a korban to me\u201d the vow is not binding. If he says, \u201cAn oath that I will not eat of yours\u201d; \u201cAn oath that  I eat of yours\u201d; \u201cNo oath that I will not eat of yours\u201d his oath is valid. In these instances oaths are more stringent than vows. There is also greater stringency in vows than in oaths. How so? If one says, \u201cKonam be the sukkah that I make,\u201d; \u201cThe lulav that I take\u201d;  \u201cThe tefillin that I put on\u201d; as vows they are binding, but as oaths they are not, because one cannot swear to transgress the commandments.","1570":"There is a vow within a vow, but not an oath within an oath. How is this so? If one declares, \u201cBehold, I will be a nazir if I eat this thing\u201d; \u201cBehold, I will be a nazir if I eat this thing\u201d and then he eats it, he is liable for each and every one. \u201cI swear that I will not eat this thing\u201d, \u201cI swear that I will not eat this thing\u201d and then he eats it, he is only liable for one oath.","1571":"Unspecified vows are interpreted strictly, but if specified they are interpreted leniently. How so? If one says, \u201cBehold! This is to me as salted meat\u201d; or \u201cAs wine of libation\u201d If he vowed by that which is to Heaven, his vow is valid. If by that which is idolatrous, his vow is invalid. And if it was unspecified, his vow is valid. If he says, \u201cBehold! This is to me as herem\u201d If as a herem to Heaven, his vow is valid; If as a herem to the priests, his vow is invalid. If it was unspecified, his vow is valid. \u201cBehold! This is to me as a tithe\u201d If he vowed, as tithes of beasts, his vow is valid. If as grain tithes, his vow is invalid. If unspecified, his vow is valid. \u201cBehold! This is to me as terumah\u201d If he vowed, as the terumah of the Temple-chamber, his vow is valid. If as the terumah of the threshing-floor, his vow is invalid. If unspecified, his vow is valid. The words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says:  An unspecified reference to terumah in Judea is a valid vow, but not in Galilee, because the Galileans are unfamiliar with the terumah of the Temple-chamber. Unspecified references to haramim in Judea are not binding but in Galilee they are, because the Galileans are unfamiliar with priestly haramim.","1572":"If one vows by herem, and says, \u201cI vowed only by a herem of kings\u201d; If he says \u201cBehold! I myself am a korban\u201d, and then says, \u201cI vowed only by the etzem which I keep for the purpose of vowing\u201d; If he says, \u201cKonam be any benefit my wife has from me\u201d, and then says, \u201cI spoke only of my first wife, whom I have divorced\u201d Regarding none of these vows should they inquire of a sage in order to break them, but if they inquire about them, they are punished and treated strictly, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say: they are given an opening on other grounds, in order that they should not act lightly with vows.","1573":"Four types of vows the Sages have invalidated:  Vows of incentive, vows of exaggeration, vows in error, and vows broken under pressure. Vows of incentive how so? If one was selling an article and said, \u201cKonam that I will not reduce below a sela\u201d; and the other replied, \u201cKonam that I will not add above a shekel\u201d both of them want a price of three denarii. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says:  Also one who wishes to subject his friend to a vow to eat with him, may say: \u201cEvery vow which I may make in the future shall be void\u201d, providing that he remembers this at the time of the vow.","1574":"Vows of exaggeration: If one says, \u201cKonam if I did not see on this road as many as departed from Egypt\u201d;  \u201cIf I did not see a snake as thick as the the beam of an olive press. Vows in error: If one says, \u201cKonam, if I ate or drank\u201d, and then remembered that he had; \u201cIf I eat or drink\u201d and then forgot his vow and ate or drank; \u201cKonam be any benefit which my wife has from me, because she stole my purse or beat my child, and it was subsequently learnt that she had not beaten him nor stolen\u201d; If one saw people eating his figs and said to them, \u201cLet the figs be a korban to you,\u201d and then discovered the people to be his father or his brothers. If others were with them: Beth Shammai says: his father and brothers are permitted, but the rest are forbidden. Beth Hillel says: all are permitted.","1575":"Vows broken under pressure: if one subjected his neighbor to a vow to eat with him,  and then he or his son fell sick, or a river prevented him from coming   such is a vow broken under pressure.","1576":"One may vow to murderers, robbers, or tax collectors that it the produce which they demand is terumah, even if it is not; or that it belongs to the royal house, even if it does not. Beth Shammai says: one may make any form of vow, except an oath; But Beth Hillel says: even an oath. Beth Shammai says: he must not volunteer to vow; Beth Hillel says: he may do so. Beth Shammai says: he may vow only as far as he makes him vow; Beth Hillel says: even in respect of what he does not make him vow. How so? If they said to him, say: \u201cKonam be any benefit my wife has of me\u201d, and he said, \u201cKonam be any benefit my wife and children have of me,\u201d Beth Shammai says: his wife is permitted, but his children are forbidden; Beth Hillel says: both are permitted.","1577":"If one says, \u201cBehold these saplings are a korban if they are not cut down\u201d; or, \u201cThis garment is a korban if it is not burnt\u201d, they can be redeemed. If he says, \u201cBehold these saplings are a korban until they are cut down\u201d; or, \u201cThis garment is a korban until it is burnt\u201d, they cannot be redeemed.","1578":"He who vows not to benefit from seafarers, may benefit from land-dwellers; But he who vows not to benefit from land-dwellers, is forbidden to benefit even from seafarers, because seafarers are included in land-dwellers; not those who merely travel from Acco to Jaffa,  but even those who sail away great distances from land.","1579":"He who vows not to benefit from those who see the sun, is forbidden to benefit even from the blind, because he meant those whom the sun sees.","1580":"He who vows not to benefit from the black-haired may not benefit from the bald or the gray-haired, but may benefit from women and children, because only men are called black-haired.","1581":"One who vows not to benefit from those born may benefit from those to be born; from those to be born, he may not benefit from those born. Rabbi Meir permits him to benefit even from those to be born; But the Sages say: he meant all whose nature it is to be born.","1582":"He who vows not to benefit from those who rest on the Sabbath, is forbidden to benefit both from Israelites and Samaritans he is permitted.","1583":"If one says, \u201cKonam that I do not benefit from the Children of Noah,\u201d he may benefit from Israelites, and he is forbidden to benefit from the nations of the world. If one says, \u201cKonam that I do not benefit from the seed of Abraham,\u201d he is forbidden to benefit from Israelites, but permitted to benefit from the nations of the world. If one says, \u201cKonam that I do not benefit from Israelites\u201d, he may buy things from them for more than their worth and sell them for less. If he says, \u201cKonam if Israelites benefit from me, he must buy from them for less and sell for more than their worth, if they will listen to him. If he says, \u201cKonam that I do not benefit from them, nor they from me\u201d, he may benefit only from non-Jews. If one says, \u201cKonam that I do not benefit from the uncircumcised\u201d, he may benefit from uncircumcised Israelites but not from circumcised heathens\u201d; If one says, \u201cKonam that I do not benefit from the circumcised,\u201d he is forbidden to benefit from uncircumcised Israelites but not from circumcised non-Jews, because \u201cuncircumcised\u201d is a term applicable only to non-Jews, as it says, \u201cFor all the nations are uncircumcised and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart\u201d (Jeremiah 9:25). And it says, \u201cAnd this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them\u201d (I Samuel 17:6). And it says, \u201cLest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult\u201d (II Samuel 1:20). Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah says: The foreskin is loathsome, since it is a term of disgrace for the wicked, as it says, \u201cFor all the nations are uncircumcised\u201d. Rabbi Ishmael says:  Great is circumcision, since thirteen covenants were made upon it. Rabbi Yose says: Great is circumcision, for it overrides the Sabbath. Rabbi Joshua ben Karha says: Great is circumcision for Moses\u2019s punishment for neglecting it was not suspended even for one hour. Rabbi Nehemiah says:  Great is circumcision, since it overrides the laws of leprosy. Rabbi says:  Great is circumcision, for despite all of the commandments which Abraham fulfilled he was not designated complete until he circumcised himself, as it says, \u201cWalk before me, and be complete\u201d (Genesis 17:1). Another explanation: \u201cGreat is circumcision, for were it not for it, the Holy One, Blessed Be He, would not have created the world, as it says, \u201cWere it not for my covenant by day and night, I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth\u201d (Jeremiah 33:35).","1584":"The only difference between one who is under a vow not to benefit at all from his neighbor, and one who is under a vow prohibiting food benefit, is in respect of walking on his property and the use of utensils not employed in the preparation of food. If a man is under a vow not to derive food benefit from his neighbor, he may not lend him a sifter, sieve, mill-stone or oven, but he may lend him a cloak, ring, garment, and earrings, and whatever is not employed in the preparation of food. In a place where things such as these are rented out, it is forbidden.","1585":"If one is under a vow not to benefit from his neighbor, his neighbor may pay his shekel, pay off his debts, and return a lost article to him. Where payment is taken for this, the benefit should become sacred property.","1586":"He may donate his terumah and his tithes with his consent. He may offer up for him the bird sacrifices of zavim and zavoth and the bird sacrifices of women after childbirth, sin-offerings and guilt-offerings. He may teach him midrash, halakhoth and aggadoth, but not Scripture, yet he may teach his sons and daughters Scripture And he may support his wife and children, even though he is liable for their maintenance. But he may not feed his beasts, whether clean or unclean. Rabbi Eliezer says: he may feed an unclean beast of his, but not a clean one. They said to him: what is the difference between an unclean and a clean beast? He replied to them, a clean beast, its life belongs to heaven, but its body is his own; but an unclean animal its body and life belongs to heaven. They said to him: The life of an unclean beast too belongs to heaven and the body is his own for if he wishes, he can sell it to a non-Jew or feed dogs with it.","1587":"If one is forbidden to benefit from his neighbor, and he pays him a visit in sickness he must stand, but not sit. He may afford him a cure of life, but not a cure of money. He may bathe together with him in a large bath, but not in a small one. He may sleep in a bed with him. Rabbi Judah said: in summer, but not in winter, because he thereby benefits him. He may nevertheless recline with him on a couch. He may eat at the same table with him but not out of the same bowl; but he may eat with him out of a bowl which returns. He may not eat with him out of the food trough put before laborers. He may not work with him on the same furrow, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say: he may work at a distance from him.","1588":"He who is forbidden by vow to benefit from his neighbor, if the vow was imposed before the seventh year, may not enter his field, nor eat produce that hangs over from the other\u2019s property. If the vow was imposed in the seventh year, he may not enter his field, but may eat of the produce that hangs over from the other\u2019s property. If he was forbidden merely in respect of food, and the vow was imposed before the seventh year, he may enter his field, but may not eat of its fruits. But if it was imposed in the seventh year, he may enter his field and eat of its fruits.","1589":"He who is forbidden by vow to benefit from his neighbor may not lend objects to him or borrow from him, lend money to him or receive from him a loan, sell to him or purchase from him. One says to another, \u201cLend me your cow.\u201d The other says, \u201cIt is not available.\u201d  The first one says, \u201cKonam, if I ever plow my field with it\u2019. If he generally plowed himself, he is forbidden, but others are permitted. But if he did not generally plow himself, he and others are forbidden.","1590":"If one is forbidden by vow to benefit from his neighbor, and he has nothing to eat, he the neighbor can go to the shopkeeper and say, \u201cSo-and-so is forbidden by vow to benefit from me, and I do not know what to do.\u201d The shopkeeper may then provide for him, and come and receive payment from him the neighbor. If he had to build his house, or his fence to set up, or his field to harvest, he the neighbor may go to laborers, and say, \u201cSo-and-so is forbidden by vow to benefit from me, and I do not know what to do.\u2019 They may then work for him and come and receive wages from him the neighbor.","1591":"If they are walking together on the road, and he has nothing to eat, he can make a gift to a third person, and he is permitted to eat it. If there is no one else with them, he may put it on a stone or a wall and say, \u201cThis is free to whomever desires it\u201d, and the other takes and eats it. Rabbi Yose prohibits this.","1592":"If  joint owners of a courtyard made a vow not to benefit from one another, they may not enter the courtyard. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says:  This one enters his own property and this one enters his own property. And both are forbidden to set up a mill-stone or an oven or raise chickens. If only one was forbidden by vow to benefit from the other, he may not enter the court. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: He can say to the other, \u201cI am entering into my own, and I am not entering into yours.\u2019 They force the one who vowed to sell his share of the courtyard.","1593":"If a man from the street was forbidden by vow to benefit from one of them, he may not enter the courtyard. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: He can say to him, \u201cI am entering into your friend\u2019s and not into yours.\u201d","1594":"If one is forbidden by vow to benefit from his neighbor, and he owns a bath-house or an olive press which is leased to someone in the town, and he has an interest in them, he is forbidden to make use of them; If he does not have an interest in them, he is permitted. If a man says to his neighbor, \u201cKonam, if I enter your house\u201d, or \u201cKonam if I purchase your field\u201d, and then the owner dies or sells it to another, he is permitted to enter or buy it; But if he says \u201cKonam, if I enter this house\u201d, or \u201cKonam if I purchase this field\u201d, and the owner dies or sells it to another, he is forbidden.","1595":"If a man says to his neighbor \u201cBehold, I am herem to you\u201d the opposite party is forbidden to derive benefit from the one who swore. \u201cBehold, you are herem to me\u201d the one who swore is forbidden. \u201cBehold, I am herem to you, and you are herem to me\u201d, both are forbidden. Both are permitted to enjoy the use of those things which belong to those who came up from Babylonia to Jerusalem, but are forbidden the use of things that belong to that town.","1596":"What are the things that belong to those that came up from Babylonia to Jerusalem? For example the Temple Mount and the Temple courtyards and the well in the middle of the road. What are the things that belong to that town? For example the public square, the bath-house, the synagogue, the ark, and the sacred scrolls. And he should assign his portion to the Patriarch. Rabbi Judah says: it is the same whether he assigns it to the Patriarch or to a private individual. But what is the difference between one who assigns it to the Patriarch and one who assigns it to a private individual? If he assigns it to the Patriarch, he need not formally confer title. But the Sages say: both this and this  require formal conferring of title, they mentioned the Patriarch in particular as this is usual. Rabbi Judah said: The Galileans need not assign their portion, because their ancestors have already done so for them.","1597":"If one is forbidden by vow to benefit from his neighbor and has nothing to eat, he may give it the food to a third party, and he is permitted to use it. It happened to one in Beth Horon that his father was forbidden to benefit from him. Now he the son was giving his son in marriage and he said to his neighbor, \u201cThe courtyard and the banquet are give to you as a gift, but they are yours only that my father may come and feast with us at the banquet.\u201d He said to him, \u201cIf they are mine, let them be dedicated to heaven!\u201d The son responded, \u201cBut I did not give you my property to dedicate it to heaven.\u201d The other responded, \u201cYou gave me yours so that you and your father might eat and drink together and become reconciled to one another, while the sin of a broken vow should devolve upon his (i.e. head.\u201d When the matter came before the Sages, they ruled: every gift which is not so given that if he the recipient dedicates it, it is dedicated, is no gift at all.","1598":"He who vows not to eat what is \u201ccooked mebushal is permitted what is roasted or seethed. If he says, \u201cKonam if I taste any cooked dish tabshil\u201d he is forbidden to eat food loosely cooked in a pot, but is permitted to eat food solidly-cooked. He may also eat a lightly boiled egg and gourds put in ashes.","1599":"He who vows abstinence from food prepared in a pot, is forbidden only from food boiled in a pot; But if he says, \u201cKonam that I taste whatever goes down into a pot\u201d, he is forbidden everything prepared in a pot.","1600":"He who vows abstinence from what is pickled is forbidden only pickled vegetables; If he says, \u201cKonam, if I taste anything pickled\u201d, he is forbidden all pickled. He who vows abstinence from what is seethed is forbidden only seethed meat; If he says, \u201cKonam, if I taste anything seethed\u201d he is forbidden every thing seethed.

He who vows abstinence from chopped terith may not eat of brine and pickled fish brine.","1602":"He who vows abstinence from milk is permitted to eat curds. But Rabbi Yose forbids it. He who vows abstinence \u201cfrom curds,\u201d is permitted milk. Abba Shaul says: he who vows abstinence from cheese, is prohibited to eat cheese, whether salted or unsalted.","1603":"He who vows abstinence from meat may eat broth and meat sediment. But Rabbi Judah prohibits. Rabbi Judah said: it once happened that Rabbi Tarfon prohibited me from eating even the eggs boiled with the meat. They replied:  That is so.  When is this true? When he says \u201cThis meat is prohibited to me.\u201d For if one vows to abstain from something, and it is mixed up with another thing, if there is a sufficient amount of the prohibited food to impart its taste to the other it  is forbidden.","1604":"He who vows abstinence from wine, may eat food which contains the taste of wine. If he says, \u201cKonam if I taste this wine\u201d, and it falls into food, if it is sufficient to impart its taste to the food it is forbidden. He who vows abstinence from grapes is permitted wine; from olives, is permitted oil. If he says, \u201cKonam if I taste these olives and grapes\u201d, he is forbidden to eat them and the liquids that come out of them.","1605":"He who vows abstinence from dates is permitted date honey; from winter grapes, is permitted winter-grape vinegar. Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra said: if it bears the name of its origin, and he vows to abstain from it,  he is forbidden to benefit from what comes from it. But the Sages permit it.","1606":"He who vows abstinence from wine is permitted apple-wine; from oil, is permitted sesame oil; from honey, is permitted date honey; from vinegar, is permitted winter grape vinegar; from leeks, is permitted porrets; from vegetables, he is permitted field-vegetables, because it is an accompanying name.","1607":"He who vows abstinence from cabbage is forbidden asparagus; from asparagus, is permitted cabbage; From grits, is forbidden grits pottage; Rabbi Yose permits it; from grits pottage is permitted grits.

If one says \u201cKonam, if I eat wheat or wheats,\u201d he is forbidden both flour and bread. \u201cIf I eat grit or, grits,\u201d he is forbidden both raw and cooked. Rabbi Judah says: If one says, \u201cKonam, if I eat grits or wheat,\u201d he may chew them raw.","1608":"He who vows abstinence from vegetables is permitted gourds. Rabbi Akiba prohibits. They said to him: And does not a man say to his messenger \u201cBring me vegetables,\u201d and he replies, \u201cI could find only gourds.\u201d He said to them:  That is so! But would he say, \u201cI could find only pulse?\u201d For gourds are included in vegetables, while pulse is not. He is forbidden fresh Egyptian beans but permitted the dry species.","1609":"He who vows abstinence from grain is forbidden dry Egyptian beans, the words of Rabbi Meir.

If he says, \u201cKonam, if wool comes upon me,\u201d he may cover himself with wool shearings; Konam if flax comes upon me\u201d, he may cover himself with stalks of flax. Rabbi Judah says: It all depends upon the person who vows, thus: if he was bearing a burden with wool or flax and perspires and had bad odor, and he said \u201cKonam if wool or flax come upon me,\u201d he may wear them, but not throw them as a bundle over his back.","1611":"One who vows not to benefit from a house is permitted the upper story, the words of Rabbi Meir.

This is a general rule: Whatever has a fixed time and one vows, \u201cUntil it arrives,\u201d he is forbidden until it arrives; if he says, \u201cUntil it be\u201d, he is forbidden until it is over. But whatever has no fixed time, whether he says, \u201cUntil it be,\u201d or \u201cUntil it arrives,\u201d he is forbidden only until it arrives.","1620":"If he says, \u201cUntil the summer,\u201d  or, \u201cUntil the summer shall be,\u201d he is forbidden until people begin to bring the figs home in baskets. \u201cUntil the summer harvest is past,\u201d he is forbidden until the knives are folded up and put away. If he vows, \u201cUntil the harvest,\u201d he is forbidden until the people begin reaping the wheat harvest, but not the barley harvest. It all depends on the place where he vowed:  if in hill-country, the hill-country harvest; if in the valley, the valley harvest.","1621":"If one vows, \u201cUntil the rains,\u201d or, \u201cUntil the rains shall be\u201d, he is forbidden until the second rainfall descends.

If one vows, \u201cUntil the rains cease,\u201d he is forbidden until all of Nisan is completed, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says:  Until Pesach is over. If one vows, \u201cKonam that I taste not wine for a year\u201d, if the year is intercalated, he is forbidden during the year and its extension. If one says, \u201cUntil the beginning of Adar,\u201d he is forbidden until the beginning of the first Adar; \u201cUntil the end of Adar,\u201d until the end of the first Adar. Rabbi Judah says: If one vows, \u201cKonam that I taste no wine until Pesach shall be,\u201d he is forbidden only until Pesach night, for he meant until the hour when people usually drink wine.","1622":"If he vows, \u201cKonam that I taste no meat until the fast i.e., Yom Kippur shall be,\u201d he is forbidden only until the eve of the fast, for he merely meant until people usually eat meat. Rabbi Yose, his son, says: \u201cKonam, that I not taste garlic until the Sabbath,\u201d he is forbidden only until Sabbath eve i.e., Friday night, for he meant, until it is customary for people to eat garlic.","1623":"If one says to his neighbor \u201cKonam, what I benefit from you, if you do not come and take for your sons a kor of wheat and two barrels of wine,\u201d the latter may annul his vow without the release of a sage, by declaring, \u201cDid you vow for any other purpose but to honor me? This refusal is my honor.\u201d Similarly, if one says to his neighbor, \u201cKonam, what you benefit from me, if you do not give my son a kor of wheat and two barrels of wine\u201d: Rabbi Meir says: he is forbidden until he gives; But the Sages say: he too can annul his vow without the release of a sage, by saying to him, \u201cI regard it as though I have received it.\u201d If they were urging him to marry his sister\u2019s daughter, and he said, \u201cKonam, what she benefits from me forever\u201d; Likewise, if he is divorcing his wife and he said, \u201cKonam, what my wife benefits from me forever,\u201d   they are permitted to benefit from him, because he meant only marriage. If he was urging his neighbor to eat at his house, and he replied, \u201cKonam be your house which I do not enter,\u201d or, \u201cThe drop of water that I do not drink,\u201d he may enter his house and drink cold water because he only meant eating and drinking in general.","1624":"Rabbi Eliezer says: They release a vow by reference to the honor of his father and mother but the Sages forbid. Rabbi Zadok said: Instead of releasing through the honor of his father and mother, they should release by reference to the honor of God.  If so, there would be no vows! But the Sages admit to Rabbi Eliezer that in a matter concerning himself and his father and mother one may release a vow by reference to the honor of his father and mother.","1625":"Rabbi Eliezer also said: They release a vow by reference to a new fact; but the Sages forbid it. How is this so? If one said, \u201cKonam that I will not benefit from so and so,\u201d and he the latter then became a scribe, or was about to give his son in marriage, and he said, \u201cHad I known that he would become a scribe or was about to give his son in marriage, I would not have vowed;\u201d Or if he said, \u201cKonam, is this house that I will not enter,\u201d and it became a synagogue, and he declared, \u201cHad I known that it would become a synagogue, I would not have vowed,\u201d Rabbi Eliezer permits the vow to be released,but the Sages forbid it.","1626":"Rabbi Meir says: Some things are similar to a new fact, and yet are not treated as new; but the Sages do not agree with him. How so? If one says, \u201cKonam that I do not marry so and so, because her father is wicked,\u201d and then they say to him \u201cHe is dead,\u201d or, \u201cHe has repented,\u201d; \u201cKonam is this house which I will not enter, because it contains a wild dog,\u201d or, \u201cbecause there is a snake in it,\u201d and then they say to him, \u201cThe dog is dead,\u201d or, \u201cThe serpent has been killed,\u201d behold these are like new facts, yet actually not treated as new facts. But the sages do not agree with him.","1627":"Rabbi Meir also said: They release the vow by using what is written in the Torah, and they say to him, \u201cHad you known that you were violating the prohibitions:\u201cYou shall not avenge\u201d (Leviticus 19:18), \u201cYou shall not bear a grudge\u201d (ibid.), \u201cYou shall not hate your kinsfolk in your heart (ibid., v., \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself\u201d (ibid., v., \u201cLet him live by your side\u201d (ibid. 25:37), for he might become poor and you would not be able to provide for him, would you have vowed?\u201d. And should he reply, \u201cHad I known that this is so, I would not have vowed,\u201d he is permitted the vow is absolved.","1628":"They release a vow by reference to a wife\u2019s kethubah. And it once happened that a man vowed not to benefit from his wife and her ketubah amounted to four hundred denarii. He went before Rabbi Akiva, who ordered him to pay her the ketubah in full. He said to him, \u201cRabbi!  My father left eight hundred denarii, of which my brother took four hundred and I took four hundred. Isn\u2019t it enough that she should receive two hundred and I two hundred?\u201d Rabbi Akiva replied: even if you have to sell the hair of your head you must pay her her ketubah. He said to him, \u201cHad I known that it is so, I would not have vowed.\u201d And Rabbi Akiva released his vow.","1629":"They release vows by reference to the sabbaths and festivals. The earlier ruling was that for these days the vow is cancelled, but for others it is binding, until Rabbi Akiva came and taught: a vow which is partially released is entirely released.","1630":"How is this so?If one says, \u201cKonam that which I benefit from any of you,\u201d if one of those subject to the vow was subsequently released, they are all released. If he said, \u201cKonam that which I benefit from this one or this one\u201d: if the first was released, all are released; if the last one was released, he is released, but the rest are forbidden. if the middle person was released, those mentioned after him are also released, but those mentioned before him are forbidden. If one says, \u201cKorban that which I benefit from this one, and from this one Korban,\u201d they each require a separate release.","1631":"\u201cKonam is the one that I taste, because wine is damaging to the stomach.\u201d They said to him, \u201cBut mature wine is beneficial to the stomach.\u201d He is released in respect of mature wine, and not only in respect of mature wine, but of all wine. \u201cKonam the onions that I taste, because they are damaging to the heart.\u201d They said to him, \u201cBut village onions are good for the heart,\u201d He is released in respect of village onions, and not only of village onions, but of all onions. Such a case happened before Rabbi Meir, and he permitted all onions.","1632":"They release one\u2019s vows by reference to his own honor and the honor of his children. They say to him, \u201cHad you known that tomorrow they will say of you, \u2018It is the regular habit of so-and-so to divorce his wife\u2019; and concerning your daughters they will say, \u2018They are the daughters of a divorced woman. What fault did he find in their mother to divorce her?\u2019 If he replies, \u201cHad I known that it is so, I would not have vowed,\u201d he is released from his vow.","1633":"\u201cKonam if I marry that ugly woman,\u201d and she turns out to be beautiful; \u201cThat black-skinned woman,\u201d and she turns out to be light-skinned; \u201cThat short woman,\u201d and she turns out to be tall, he is permitted to marry her, not because she was ugly, and became beautiful, or black and became light-skinned, short and grew tall, but because the vow was made in error. And thus it happened with one who vowed not to benefit from his sister\u2019s daughter, and she was taken into Rabbi Ishmael\u2019s house and they made her beautiful. Rabbi Ishmael said to him, \u201cMy son!  Did you vow not to benefit from this one!\u201d He said, \u201cNo,\u201d and Rabbi Ishmael permitted her to him. In that hour Rabbi Ishmael wept and said, \u201cThe daughters of Israel are beautiful, but poverty disfigures them.\u201d And when Rabbi Ishmael died, the daughters of Israel raised a lament, saying, \u201cDaughters of Israel weep for Rabbi Ishmael.\u201d And thus it is said too of Saul, \u201cDaughters of Israel, weep for Saul\u201d (II Samuel 1:24).","1634":"In the case of a betrothed young woman, her father and her betrothed husband annul her vows. If her father annulled her vow but not the husband, or if the husband annulled it but not the father, it is not annulled; and it goes without saying if one of them upheld it.","1635":"If the father dies, his authority does not pass over to the husband. If the husband dies, his authority passes over to the father. In this respect, the father\u2019s power is greater than the husband\u2019s. But in another respect, the husband\u2019s power is greater than that of the father, for the husband can annul her vows when she is of majority age but the father cannot annul her vows when she is of majority age.","1636":"If one vowed as a betrothed woman, and then was divorced on that day and betrothed again on the same day, even a hundred times, her father and last betrothed husband can annul her vows. This is the general rule: as long as she has not passed out into her own control for even one hour, her father and last husband can annul her vows.","1637":"It is the practice of scholars, before the daughter of one of them departs from him, he says to her, \u201cAll the vows which you vowed in my house are annulled.\u201d Likewise the husband, before she enters into his domain would say to her, \u201cAll the vows which you vowed before you entered my domain are annulled,\u201d because once she enters into his domain he cannot annul them.","1638":"In the case of a girl who has reached majority age who waited twelve months, or a widow who waited thirty days, Rabbi Eliezer says: since her betrothed husband is responsible for her maintenance, he may annul her vows. But the Sages say: the husband cannot annul her vows until she enters into his domain.","1639":"If a woman waits for a yavam, whether for one or for two yevamim: Rabbi Eliezer says: he can annul her vows. Rabbi Joshua says: only if she waits for one, but not for two. Rabbi Akiva says: neither for one nor for two. Rabbi Eliezer said: if a man can annul the vows of a woman whom he himself acquired, isn\u2019t it logical that can he annul those of a woman bequeathed to him by Heaven! Rabbi Akiva said to him: No! If you speak of a woman whom he himself acquires, that is because others have no rights in her; will you say the same of a woman given to him by Heaven, in whom others too have rights! Rabbi Joshua said to him: Akiva, your words apply to two yevamim; but what will you answer if there is only one yavam? He said to him (Rabbi Joshua): the yevamah is not as completely acquired to the yavam as a betrothed girl is to her betrothed husband.","1640":"If a man says to his wife, \u201cAll vows which you may vow from now until I return from such and such a place behold, they are upheld,\u201d he has not said anything. If he said: All vows which you may vow from now until I return from such and such a place, behold, they are annulled,\u201d: Rabbi Eliezer says: they are annulled; The Sages say:  they are not annulled. Said Rabbi Eliezer: if he can annul vows which have already had the force of a prohibition, surely he can annul those which have not had the force of prohibition! They said to him: behold, it is said, \u201cHer husband may uphold it, and her husband may annul it\u201d (Numbers 30:14), that which has entered the category of upholding, has entered the category of annulment; but that which has not entered the category of upholding, has not entered the category of annulment.","1641":"The annulment of vows is the whole day. This may result in a stringency or in a leniency. How is this so? If she vowed on the eve of the Sabbath, he can annul on the eve of the sabbath and on the Sabbath day until nightfall. If she vowed just before nightfall, he can annul only until nightfall: for if night fell and he had not annulled it, he can no longer annul it.","1642":"And these are the vows which he can annul: vows which involve self-denial. For instance: \u201cIf I bathe\u201d or \u201cIf I do not bathe;\u201d \u201cIf I adorn myself,\u201d or, \u201cIf I do not adorn myself.\u201d Rabbi Yose says: these are not vows of self-denial.","1643":"But these are vows of self-denial:If she says, \u201cKonam be the produce of the whole world to me\u201d, he can annul. \u201cKonam be the produce of this region to me,\u201d he should bring her that of a different region. \u201cKonam be the produce of this shopkeeper to me\u201d, he cannot annul. But if he can obtain his sustenance only from him, he can annul, the words of Rabbi Yose.","1644":"If she vows, \u201cKonam, that which I benefit from mankind,\u201d he cannot annul, and she can benefit from gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and the corners of the field. If one says, \u201cKonam be the benefit which priests and Levites have from me\u201d, they can take from him against his will. But if he vows, \u201cKonam be the benefit these priests and Levites have from me,\u201d other priests and Levites should take.","1645":"If she vows, \u201cKonam that which I do for my father,\u201d or \u201cyour father,\u201d or \u201cmy brother,\u201d or \u201cyour brother,\u201d the husband cannot annul it. \u201cKonam \u201cthat which I do for you,\u201d he need not annul it. Rabbi Akiva says: he should annul it, lest she make more than is fitting for him. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said: he should annul it, lest he divorce her and she thereby be forbidden to him.","1646":"If his wife vowed, and he thought that his daughter had vowed, or if his daughter vowed and he thought that his wife had vowed; If she took the vow of a nazirite, and he thought that she had vowed by a korban, or if she vowed by a korban, and he thought that she vowed a nazirite vow; If she vowed to abstain from figs, and he thought that she vowed to abstain from grapes, or if she vowed to abstain from grapes and he thought that she vowed from figs, he must annul the vow again.","1647":"If she vows, \u201cKonam these figs and grapes which I taste\u201d, and he the husband confirms the vow in respect of figs, the whole vow is confirmed; If he annuls it in respect of figs, it is not annulled, unless he annuls in respect of grapes too. If she vows, \u201cKonam the figs that I taste and these grapes that I taste\u201d, they are two distinct vows.","1648":"If the husband declares, \u201cI knew that there were vows, but I did not know that they could be annulled\u201d, he may annul them now. But if he says: \u201cI knew that I could annul them, but I did not know that this was a vow,\u201d Rabbi Meir says: he cannot annul it, But the Sages say: he can annul.","1649":"If a man is under a vow that his son-in-law shall not benefit from him, and he wants to give money to his daughter, he must say to her, \u201cThis money is given to you as a gift, providing that your husband has no rights with it, and it is only given to you so that may put to your personal use.\u201d","1650":"\u201cBut every vow of a widow and of a divorcee\u2026 shall be binding upon her\u201d (Numbers 30:9).How is this so? If she said, \u201cBehold, I will be a nazirite after thirty days\u201d, even if she married within the thirty days, he cannot annul it. If she vows while in her husband\u2019s domain, he can annul the vow for her. How is this so? If she said, \u201cBehold, I will be a nazirite after thirty days,\u201d and her husband annulled it, even though she was widowed or divorced within the thirty days, it is annulled. If she vowed on one day, and he divorced her on the same day and took her back on the same day, he cannot annul it. This is the general rule: once she has gone into her own domain even for a single hour, he cannot annul.","1651":"There are nine young girls whose vows stand: 1a a girl who reached majority age who is like an orphan; 1b a young girl who vowed and then reached majority age who is like an orphan; 1c a young girl who has not yet reached majority age, who is like an orphan; 2a a girl who reached majority age and whose father died; 2b a young girl who vowed and then reached majority age and whose father died; 2c a young girl who has not yet reached majority age and whose father died; 3a a young girl whose father died, and after her father died she became of majority age; 3b a girl who has reached majority age whose father is alive; 3c a young girl who has reached majority age and whose father is alive. Rabbi Judah says: also one who married off his daughter while a minor, and she was widowed or divorced and returned to him her father and is still a young girl.","1652":"If she vows, \u201cKonam the benefit that I derive from my father or from your father if I make anything for you,\u201d Or, \u201cKonam the benefit that I derive from you, if I make anything for my father or your father,\u201d he can annul.","1653":"At first they would say that three women must be divorced and receive their ketubah: She who says: \u201cI am defiled to you\u201d; \u201cHeaven is between me and you\u201d; \u201cI have been removed from the Jews.\u201d But subsequently they changed the ruling to prevent her from setting her eye on another and spoiling herself to her husband: She who said, \u201cI am defiled unto you\u201d must bring proof. \u201cHeaven is between me and you\u201d they shall appease them by a request. \u201cI have been removed from the Jews\u201d   he the husband must annul his portion, and she may have relations with him, and she shall be removed from other Jews.","1654":"One who warns his wife not to associate with a certain man: Rabbi Eliezer says: he warns her on the testimony of two witnesses, and makes her drink the bitter waters on the testimony of one witness or on his own testimony. Rabbi Joshua says: he warns her on the testimony of two and makes her drink on the testimony of two.","1655":"How does he warn her? If he says to her in front of two witnesses, \u201cDo not speak with that man\u201d, and she spoke with him, she is still permitted to her husband and permitted to eat terumah. If she entered a private place with him and stayed with him a time sufficient for her to be defiled by having sexual intercourse with him, she is forbidden to her husband  and forbidden to eat terumah. If her husband died, she performs halitzah but cannot contract yibbum.","1656":"The following are prohibited to eat terumah:She who says to her husband, \u201cI am unclean to you\u201d, and witnesses came and testified that she was unclean; She who says, \u201cI refuse to drink the water\u201d. She whose husband does not want to make her drink the water: And she whose husband had intercourse with her on the journey. How does the husband deal with her? He brings her to the court in the place where he resides, and they assign to him two disciples of the sages lest he have intercourse with her on the journey. Rabbi Judah says, her husband is trusted with her.","1657":"They bring her up to the great court which is in Jerusalem, and the judges solemnly admonish her in the same way that they admonish witnesses in capital cases. And they say to her, \u201cMy daughter, much is done by wine does much, much is done by frivolity, much is done by youth, much is done by bad neighbors. For the sake of His great name which is written in holiness do it so that it may not be rubbed out on the water.\u201d And they say to her matters which neither she nor all the family of her father's house is worthy to hear.","1658":"If she said, \u201cI am defiled to you\u201d, she gives him a receipt for her ketubah and goes out with a get. But if she says, \u201cI am pure\u201d, they bring her up to the east gate, Nicanor\u2019s gate, where they give women suspected of adultery the water to drink, purify women after childbirth and purify lepers. A priest seizes her clothing if they are torn, then they are torn, and if they become unstitched, then they are unstitched, until he uncovers her bosom, and he undoes the braids of her hair. Rabbi Judah says: if her bosom was beautiful he does not uncover it, and if her hair was beautiful he does not undo it.","1659":"If she was clothed in white, he clothes her in black. If she wore gold jewelry or necklaces, ear-rings and finger-rings, they remove them from her in order to make her repulsive. After that the priest takes a rope made of twigs and binds it over her breasts. Whoever wishes to look upon her comes to look with the exception of her male and female slaves, since she has no shame in front of them. All of the women are permitted to look upon her, as it is said, \u201cThat all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness\u201d (Ezekiel 23:48).","1660":"In the measure with which a person metes out to others, they mete out to him. She adorned herself for a sin; the Omnipresent made her repulsive. She exposed herself for a sin; the Omnipresent exposed her. She began the transgression with the thigh and afterwards with the womb; therefore she is punished first in the thigh and afterwards in the womb, nor does all the body escape.","1661":"Samson went after the desire of his eyes; therefore the Philistines put out his eyes, as it is said, \u201cAnd the Philistines laid hold of him, and put out his eyes\u201d (Judges 16:2. Absalom was proud of his hair, therefore he was hanged by his hair. And because he had relations with the ten of his father\u2019s concubines, therefore they thrust ten spears in him, as it is said, \u201cAnd ten of Joab\u2019s young arms-bearers closed in and struck Absalom until he died\u201d (II Samuel 18:15). And because he stole three hearts, the heart of his father, the heart of the court, and the heart of Israel, as it is said, \u201cSo Absalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel\u201d (II Samuel 15:6), therefore three darts were driven into him, as it is said, \u201cAnd he took three darts in his hand, and drove them through the heart of Absalom\u201d (II Samuel 18:1.","1662":"The same is true for good.Miriam waited one hour for Moses, as it is said, \u201cAnd his sister stood afar off\u201d, (Exodus 2:4), therefore Israel was delayed for her seven days in the wilderness, as it is said, \u201cAnd the people did not journey until Miriam was brought in again\u201d (Numbers 12:15). Joseph had the merit of burying his father and there was none among his brothers greater than he, as it is said, \u201cAnd Joseph went up to bury his father\u2026and there both chariots and horsemen went up with him\u201d (Exodus 50:7,9). Whom do we have who is greater than Joseph since none other than Moses occupied himself with his burial? Moses had the merit to bury the bones of Joseph and there was none in Israel greater than he, as it is said, \u201cAnd Moses took the bones of Joseph with him\u201d (Exodus 13:19).   Whom do have greater than Moses since none other than the Omnipresent was occupied with his burial, as it is said, \u201cAnd He buried him in the valley\u201d (Deuteronomy 34:6)? Not only concerning Moses did they say this, but concerning all the righteous, as it is said, \u201cAnd your righteousness shall go before your, the presence of God shall gather you in death\u201d (Isaiah 58:8).","1663":"The husband brings her meal-offering in a basket of palm-twigs and places it upon her hands in order to weary her. With all other meal-offerings, their beginning and their end are in ministering vessels; but with this, its beginning is in a basket of palm-twigs and its end in a ministering vessel. All other meal-offerings require oil and frankincense, but this requires neither oil nor frankincense. All other meal-offerings come from wheat, but this comes from barley. The meal-offering of the Omer, although it comes from barley, was in the form of sifted flour; but this comes from unsifted flour. Rabban Gamaliel says: just as her actions were the actions of an animal, so her offering consisted of animal's fodder.","1664":"The priest takes an earthenware bowl and pours half a log of water into it from the laver. Rabbi Judah says: a quarter of a log. Just as Rabbi Judah reduces the amount of writing, so he reduces the quantity of water. Then the priest enters the temple and turns to his right and there was a place there on the floor that was a cubit by a cubit, and a marble tablet, to which a ring was attached. When he would lift this up, he would take some dust from beneath it which he puts into the bowl so that it would be seen on top of the water; as it is said, \u201cAnd of the dust that is on the floor of the Tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water\u201d (Numbers 5:17).","1665":"He now comes to write the scroll.From what place in Scripture does he write? From \u201cIf no man has lain with you  \u2026 but if you have gone astray while married to your husband\u201d He does not write \u201cAnd the woman shall say, \u2018amen, amen\u2019\u201d (vs.. Rabbi Yose says:  he makes no omissions. Rabbi Judah says: he writes nothing except, \u201c\u201cMay the Lord make you a curse and an imprecation \u2026 And may this water that induces the spell enter your body make your belly swell, and your thigh to sag.\u201d (vs. 21-2 He does not write \u201cAnd the woman shall say, \u2018amen, amen\u2019\u201d (vs..","1666":"He writes neither on a wooden tablet nor on papyrus nor on rough parchment but on a parchment scroll, as it is said, \u201cIn a scroll\u201d    writing which is capable of being blotted out.","1667":"To what does she respond \u201cAmen, amen\u201d?\u201cAmen\u201d over the curse and \u201camen\u201d over the oath; \u201cAmen\u201d with respect to this man and \u201camen\u201d with respect to any other man. \u201cAmen\u201d that I did not go astray as a betrothed girl or married woman or a shomeret yavam or a woman taken into her yavam\u2019s house. \u201cAmen\u201d that I have not been defiled and if I have, may these curses come upon me. Rabbi Meir says: \u201cAmen\u201d that I have not been defiled and the \u201camen\u201d that I will not become defiled in the future.","1668":"All agree that he cannot make a stipulation with her with regard to the time before she was betrothed or after she is divorced. If she secludes herself with the man about whom she was warned, but after being divorced and was defiled and subsequently her husband took her back, he cannot make a stipulation with her in regard to this. This is the general rule: any with whom she has intercourse and was not prohibited to him at that time the husband cannot make a stipulation on this.","1669":"He takes her meal-offering out of the basket of palm-twigs and places it in a ministering vessel and sets it upon her hand. And the priest places his hand under hers and waves it.","1670":"He waves it, he brings it near the altar, he takes a handful and he turns it into smoke, and then the remainder is eaten by the priests. He first gives her the water to drink, and then sacrifices her meal-offering. Rabbi Shimon says: he sacrifices her meal-offering and then gives her to drink, as it is said, \u201cAnd afterward he shall make the woman drink the water\u201d (Numbers 5:26), but if he gave her to drink and then sacrificed her meal-offering it is valid.","1671":"If before the writing on the scroll had been rubbed out, she said \u201cI refuse to drink\u201d, her scroll is stored away and her meal-offering is scattered over the ashes. And her scroll is not valid to be used in giving another sotah to drink. If the writing on the scroll has been rubbed out and she said \u201cI am defiled\u201d, the water is poured out and her meal-offering is scattered over the ashes. If the writing on the scroll had been rubbed out and she said \u201cI refuse to drink\u201d, they open her throat and make her drink by force.","1672":"She had barely finished drinking when her face turns yellow, her eyes protrude and her veins swell. And those who see her exclaim, \u201cRemove her! Remove her, so that the temple-court should not be defiled\u201d. If she had merit, it causes the water to suspend its effect upon her. Some merit suspends the effect for one year, some merit suspends the effects for two years, and some merit suspends the effect for three years. Hence Ben Azzai said: a person must teach his daughter Torah, so that if she has to drink the water of bitterness, she should know that the merit suspends its effect. Rabbi Eliezer says: whoever teaches his daughter Torah teaches her lasciviousness. Rabbi Joshua says: a woman prefers one kav and sexual indulgence to nine kav and sexual separation. He used to say, a foolish pietist, a cunning wicked person, a female separatist, and the blows of separatists bring destruction upon the world.","1673":"Rabbi Shimon says: merit does not suspend the effect of the bitter waters, and if you say that merit does suspend the effect of the bitter waters, you discredit the water in the case of all the women who drink it and defame the pure woman who drank it, since people will say, \u201cThey were defiled\u201d, but their merit caused suspended the effect. Rabbi says: merit suspends the effect of the bitter waters, but she never bears a child or thrives, rather she gradually becomes disfigured and finally dies through that death.","1674":"If her meal-offering became defiled before it was sanctified in the ministering vessel, behold it is like all meal-offerings similarly defiled and can be redeemed. But if it became defiled after it had been sanctified in the ministering vessel, behold it is like all meal-offerings similarly defiled and it is burned. These are the ones whose meal-offerings are burned: She who says, \u201cI am defiled to you\u201d; And when witnesses came and testified that she had been defiled; She who says \u201cI refuse to drink\u201d, She whose husband refuses to let her drink; And she whose husband had relations with her on the journey to Jerusalem. And the meal-offerings of all women married to priests are burned.","1675":"The meal-offering of the daughter of an Israelite who is married to a priest is burned. But the meal-offering of the daughter of a priest who is married to an Israelite is eaten. What differences are there in law between a priest and a priest's daughter? The meal-offering of a priest\u2019s daughter is eaten but the meal-offering of a priest is not eaten. A priest\u2019s daughter may become deconsecrated, but a priest does not become deconsecrated. A priest\u2019s daughter may defile herself by contact with the dead, but a priest may not defile himself by contact with the dead. A priest eats of the most holy things, but a priest\u2019s daughter may not eat of the most holy things.","1676":"What differences are there in law between a man and a woman?A man who has leprosy rends his clothes and loosens his hair, but a woman does not rend her clothes and loosen her hair. A man may vow that his son will become a nazirite, but a woman may not vow that her son will become a nazirite. A man can shave with offerings set aside for his father\u2019s naziriteship but a woman cannot shave with offerings set aside for her father\u2019s naziriteship. A man may sell his daughter, but a woman may not sell her daughter. A man may give his daughter in betrothal, but a woman may not give her daughter in betrothal. A man is stoned naked, but a woman is not stoned naked. A man is hanged after being put to death, but a woman is not hanged. A man is sold for to make restitution for his theft, but a woman is not sold to make restitution for her theft.","1677":"A betrothed woman and a shomeret yavam do not drink the bitter waters and do not receive their ketubah, as it is said, \u201cWhen a wife, being under her husband, goes astray\u201d (Numbers 5:29),  this excludes a betrothed woman and a shomeret yavam. A widow who had married a high priest, a divorced woman or a halutzah who had married an ordinary priest, a mamzeret or a netinah who had married an Israelite, and the daughter of an Israelite who had married a mamzer or a natin do not drink the bitter waters and do not receive their ketubah.","1678":"And these are the women who do not drink and do not receive their ketubah: She who says \u201cI am defiled\u201d; When witnesses came and testified that she was defiled; And she who says \u201cI refuse to drink.\u201d When her husband says \u201cI am not letting her drink\u201d, And when her husband has sexual relations with her on the journey to Jerusalem she receives her ketubah but does not drink. If the husbands died before the women drank: Beth Shammai says: they receive their ketubah but do not drink, And Beth Hillel says:  they do not drink and they do not receive their ketubah.","1679":"A wife who was pregnant by a former husband or was nursing a child by a former husband does not drink and does not receive the ketubah, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages says: he may separate her from himself and take her back after the period of two years. An aylonit who is incapable of giving birth, an old woman, and one who is unfit to bear children do not drink and do not receive the ketubah. Rabbi Eliezer says: he may marry another wife and be fruitful and multiply with her. All other women either drink or do not receive the ketubah.","1680":"The wife of a priest drinks and if she is found to be innocent is permitted to her husband. The wife of a eunuch drinks. Through seclusion with all persons forbidden to her in marriage wives are subjected to warning with the exception of a minor and one not a human.","1681":"In the following cases a court can give the warning on behalf of the husband: When the husband became a deaf-mute or an idiot, or was imprisoned. Not in order to make her drink did they say this, but to disqualify her from receiving her ketubah. Rabbi Yose says: also to make her drink; when her husband is released from prison he makes her drink.","1682":"Just as the water checks her so the water checks him, as it is said, \u201cAnd shall enter\u201d, \u201cAnd shall enter\u201d (Numbers 5:22,. Just as she is prohibited to the husband so is she prohibited to the lover, as it is said, \u201cdefiled \u2026 and is defiled\u201d (Numbers 5:27,, the words of Rabbi Akiba. Rabbi Joshua said: thus Zechariah ben Hakatzav used to expound.

This teaches that a loaf which is unclean in the second degree, makes unclean food and liquids which come into contact with it in the third degree. Rabbi Joshua said: who will remove the dust from your eyes, Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, since you used to say that in the future another generation will pronounce clean a loaf which is unclean in the third degree on the grounds that there is no text in the Torah according to which it is unclean!   Has not Rabbi Akiva your student brought a text from the Torah according to which it is unclean, as it is said \u201ceverything in it shall be unclean.\u201d","1684":"On that day Rabbi Akiva expounded, \u201cYou shall measure off two thousand cubits outside the town on the east side\u201d (Numbers 35:5).   But another verse states, \u201cfrom the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits around\u201d (vs. It is impossible to say that it was a thousand cubits since it has been already stated two thousand cubits; and it is impossible to say that it was two thousand cubits since it has been already stated a thousand cubits! How then is this so? A thousand cubits for the field surrounding the city and two thousand cubits for the Sabbath-limits. Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: a thousand cubits for the field surrounding the city and two thousand cubits for fields and vineyards.","1685":"On that day Rabbi Akiva expounded, \u201cThen Moses and the children of Israel sang this song unto the Lord and said saying\u201d (Exodus 15:. For the Torah did not need to say \u201csaying\u201d, so why did the Torah say \u201csaying\u201d? It teaches that the Israelites responded to every sentence after Moses, in the manner of reading Hallel; that is why it says \u201csaying\u201d. Rabbi Nehemiah says: as is the reading the Shema and not Hallel.","1686":"On that day Rabbi Joshua ben Hyrcanus expounded: Job only served the Holy One, blessed be He, from love: as it is said, \u201cThough he slay me, yet I will wait for him\u201d did not Joshua, the student of your student, teach that what he did was from love?","1687":"If a man warned his wife and she secluded herself with another man, even if he heard that she had done so from a flying bird, he must divorce her and give her the ketubah, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Joshua says: until women who spin by moonlight discuss her.","1688":"If one witness said, \u201cI saw that she was defiled\u201d, she does not drink the water. Not only that, but even a slave, male or female, is believed even to disqualify her from receiving her ketubah. Her mother-in-law, her mother-in-law\u2019s daughter, her rival wife, her sister-in-law, and the daughter of her husband are believed, not to disqualify her from receiving her ketubah, but that she should not drink.","1689":"For it would have been logical:  Now if the first evidence that the woman had secluded herself with the man, which does not prohibit her to her husband for all time, is not established by fewer than two witnesses, is it not logical that the final evidence that she had been defiled which does prohibit her to him for all time, should not be established by fewer than two witnesses! Scripture states, \u201cAnd there is no witness against her\u201d whatever testimony there may be against her is believed. And now with respect to the first evidence about her seclusion with the man there is an a fortiori argument:  Now if the final evidence regarding her being defiled, which prohibits her to her husband for all time, is established by one witness, is it not logical that the first evidence, which does not prohibit her to him for all time, should be established by one witness! Scripture states, \u201cBecause he has found some unseemly matter in her\u201d (Deuteronomy 24:1), and elsewhere Scripture states, \u201cBy the mouth of two witnesses ... shall the matter be established\u201d (Deuteronomy 19:15); just as the \u201cmatter\u201d mentioned in this latter case must be based on the testimony of two witnesses, so also here in the case of the suspected woman the \u201cmatter\u201d must be based on the testimony of two witnesses.","1690":"If one witness says that she was defiled and another witness says that she was not defiled; Or if a woman says of her that she was defiled and another woman says that she was not defiled, she drinks. If one witness says that she was defiled and two say that she was not defiled, she drinks. If two say that she was defiled and one says that she did not, she does not drink.","1691":"The following may be recited in any language:the section concerning the sotah, the confession made at the presentation of tithes, the shema, the prayer (the amidah), the grace after meals, the oath concerning testimony, the oath concerning a deposit.","1692":"The following are recited in the holy tongue (Hebrew):The reading made at the offering of the firstfruits, The recitation at halitzah, The blessings and curses, The priestly blessing, The blessing of the high priest, The section of the king, The section of the calf whose neck is broken, And the priest anointed to accompany the army in battle when he speaks to the people.","1693":"How is it that the declaration made at the bringing of the first-fruits must be in Hebrew?

They turned their faces towards Mt. Gerizim and opened with the blessing: Blessed be anyone who does not make a graven or molten image\u201d. And these and these respond amen. They then turned their faces towards Mt. Ebal and opened with the curse: \u201cCursed be anyone who makes a graven or molten image\u201d (Deut. 27:15). And these and these respond amen. So they continue until they complete the blessings and curses. After that they brought the stones, built the altar and plastered it with plaster, and inscribed upon it all the words of the Torah in seventy languages, as it is said, \u201cmost distinctly (be\u2019er hetev). Then they took the stones and went and spent the night in their place.","1696":"How was the priestly blessing pronounced?In the province it was said as three blessings, but in the Temple as one blessing. In the Temple the name was uttered as it is written, but in the province in its substituted name. In the province the priests raise their hands at the height of their shoulders, but in the Temple above their heads, except the high priest who does not raise his hands higher than the frontlet (on his forehead). Rabbi Judah says: even the high priest raises his hands higher than the frontlet, as it says, \u201cAnd Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them\u201d (Leviticus 9:22).","1697":"How were the benedictions of the high priest performed?The hazzan of the synagogue takes the Torah scroll and gives it to the president of the synagogue; and the president of the synagogue gives it to the vice-president of the synagogue; and the vice-president of the synagogue gives it to the high priest, and the high priest stands, receives the scroll and reads the following portions:  \u201cAfter the death\u201d and the rest of the prayer.","1698":"How was the procedure in connection with the portion read by the king?At the conclusion of the first day of the festival in the eighth year, at the end of the seventh year, they erect a wooden platform in the Temple court, and he sits upon it, as it is said, \u201cAt the end of seven years, in the set time\u201d etc his eyes ran with tears. They said to him, \u201cFear not, Agrippas, you are our brother, you are our brother!\u201d The king reads from the beginning of \u201cThese are the words\u201d until the Shema and the portion of the king and the blessings and curses (ibid, until he finishes all the section. The blessings that the high priest recites, the king recites, except that he substitutes one for the festivals instead of one for the pardon of sin.","1699":"When the anointed for battle addresses the people he speaks in the holy tongue, as it is said, \u201cAnd it shall be, when you draw near the battle, that the priest shall approach\u201d this refers to the anointed for battle. \u201cAnd speak to the people\u201d \u2013 in the holy tongue. \u201cHe shall say to them, \u201cHear, O Israel, you are about to join battle with your enemy\u201d (vs.  \u201cwith your enemy\u201d but not against your brother, not Judah against Shimon nor Shimon against Benjamin, that if you fall into their hand they shall have mercy on you, as it is said, \u201cThen the men named above proceeded to take the captives in hand, and with booty they clothed all the naked among them they clothed them and shod them and gave them to eat and drink and anointed them and provide donkeys for all who were failing and brought them to Jericho, the city of palms, back to their kinsmen. Then they returned to Samaria\u201d (II Chronicles 28:15).  Rather against your enemies do you march, so that if you fall into their hand they will have no mercy on you. \u201cLet not your courage falter, fear not, and do not tremble or be in dread of them\u201d (Deuteronomy 20: \u201cLet not your courage falter\u201d-- at the neighing of the horses and the brandishing of swords; \u201cFear not\u201d --at the crash of shields and the tramp of the soldiers shoes; \u201cDo not tremble\u201d -- at the sound of trumpets; \u201cOr be in dread of them\u201d -- at the sound of battle cries. \u201cFor it is the Lord your God that goes with you\u201d--they come relying upon the might of flesh and blood, but you come relying upon the might of the Omnipresent. The Philistines came relying upon the power of Goliath (I Samuel 17:4 ff.), but what happened to him in the end? In the end he fell by the sword and they fell with him. The Ammonites came relying upon the power of Shobach (II Samuel 10:16-18), but what happened to him in the end? In the end he fell by the sword and they fell with him. But with you it is otherwise, \u201cFor it is the Lord your God is that goes with you\u201d this refers to the camp of the ark.","1700":"\u201cThen the officers shall address the people saying:  \u2018Is there anyone who has built a new house but has not dedicated it?

If a high priest married a widow, or an ordinary priest married a divorcee or a halutzah, or an Israelite married a mamzereth or a netinah, or the daughter of an Israelite married a mamzer or a natin, he does not return home. Rabbi Judah says: even he who builds a house upon its original foundations does not return home. Rabbi Eliezer says: even he who builds a brick-house in the Sharon does not return home.","1702":"The following do not move from their place: He who built a new house and dedicated it, He who planted a vineyard and used its fruit, He who married his betrothed, Or brought in his yevamah; As it is said, \u201cHe shall be exempt one year for the sake of his household to give happiness to the woman he married\u201d \u201cHis household,\u201d this refers to his house; \u201cShall be\u201d refers to his vineyard; \u201cTo give happiness to the wife\u201d refers to his wife; \u201cHe married\u201d to include his yevamah\u2019s widow.

Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: \u201cafraid and disheartened\u201d this is the one who is afraid because of the transgressions he has committed; therefore the Torah connected all these other categories of those who return home with him that he may return home on their account. Rabbi Yose says: a high priest who married a widow, an ordinary priest who married a divorcee or halutzah, an Israelite who married a mamzeret or netinah, and the daughter of an Israelite who married a mamzer or a natin behold this one is \u201cafraid and disheartened.\u201d","1704":"\u201cAnd it shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, they shall appoint captains of hosts at the head of the people\u201d and elsewhere it states, \u201cAnd the men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell down slain\u201d (ibid 31:1).","1705":"To what this apply?  To a voluntary war, but in a war commanded by the Torah all go out, even a bridegroom from his chamber and a bride from her canopy. Rabbi Judah says: to what does this apply? To a war commanded commanded by the Torah, but in an obligatory war all go out, even a bridegroom from his chamber and a bride from her canopy.","1706":"The declaration over the heifer whose neck is to be broken must be in the holy tongue; as it is said, \u201cIf a corpse is found slain on the land \u2026 then your elders and judges shall go out\u201d (Deuteronomy 21:1-2)--three used to go out from the high court in Jerusalem. Rabbi Judah says: five, as it is said, \u201cYour elders\u201d two, \u201cand your judges\u201d two, and there cannot be a court of an even number, they add one more.","1707":"If the corpse was found buried underneath a heap of stones, or hanging on a tree, or floating on the surface of the water, they would not break the heifer\u2019s neck, as it says: \u201cIn the earth\u201d   and not buried underneath a heap of stones, nor hanging on a tree; \u201cIn a field\u201d  and not floating on the surface of the water. If it was found near the border, or a city whose majority of inhabitants were Gentiles, or a city in which there is no court, they would not break the heifer's neck. They only measure the distance from a city in which there is a court. If the corpse was found exactly between two cities, both of them bring two heifers between them, the words of Rabbi Eliezer; Jerusalem does not bring a heifer whose neck is to be broken.","1708":"If the head was found in one place and the body in another place, they bring the head to the body, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Akiva says: they bring the body to the head.","1709":"From what part of the body do they measure? Rabbi Eliezer says: from the navel. Rabbi Akiva says: from the nose.

The site may never be sown or tilled, but it is permitted to comb flax and chisel rocks.","1711":"The elders of that city then wash their hands with water in the place where the heifer's neck was broken and they say, \u201cOur hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it\u201d (Deuteronomy 21:7). But did we really think that the elders of a court of justice are shedders of blood! Rather, the intention of their statement is that the man found dead did not come to us for help and we dismissed him without supplying him with food and we did not see him and let him go without escort. Then the priests exclaim, \u201cAbsolve, O Lord, Your people Israel, whom You redeemed, and do not let guilt for the blood of the innocent remain among your people Israel\u201d (vs.. They did not need to say, \u201cAnd they will be absolved of bloodguilt\u201d (ibid), rather the Holy Spirit announces to them, \u201cWhen you act in this way, the blood is forgiven you.\u201d","1712":"If the murderer was discovered before the heifer\u2019s neck was broken, it goes free and grazes with the herd; But if after the heifer\u2019s neck was broken, it is buried in that place because it came there from the outset in connection with a matter of doubt, and atoned for the doubt which is now gone.

That was from the time of Eliezer ben Dinai, and he was also called Tehinah ben Perisha and he was afterwards renamed \u201cson of the murderer\u201d. When adulterers multiplied, the ceremony of the bitter waters ceased and it was Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai who discontinued it, as it is said, \u201cI will not punish their daughters for fornicating, nor their daughters-in-law for committing adultery, for they themselves turn aside with whores and sacrifice with prostitutes\u201d (Hosea 4:14). When Yose ben Yoezer of Zeredah and Yose ben Yohanan of Jerusalem died, the grape-clusters ceased, as it is said, \u201cThere is not a cluster of grapes to eat; not a ripe fig I could desire The pious are vanished from the land, none upright are left among men\u201d (Micah 7:1-2).","1715":"Yohanan the high priest brought to an end the confession made at the presentation of the tithe. He also discontinued the wakers and the knockers Up to his days the hammer used to strike in Jerusalem, And in his days there was no need to inquire about doubtfully tithed produce.","1716":"When the Sanhedrin ceased to function, song ceased from the places of feasting, as it is said, \u201cThey drink their wine without song\u201d (Isaiah 24:9).","1717":"When the former prophets died, the Urim and Thummim ceased. When Temple was destroyed, the shamir and nopheth zufim ceased. And people of faith ceased, as it says, \u201cHelp, O Lord, for the faithful are no more\u201d (Psalms 12:2). Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel in the name of Rabbi Joshua:  from the day the Temple was destroyed, there is no day without a curse, the dew has not descended for a blessing, and the flavor has departed from produce. Rabbi Yose says: the fatness was also removed from produce.","1718":"Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: the cessation of observation of the purity laws has removed taste and fragrance, the cessation of observation of the tithes has removed the fatness of grain. But the Sages say: licentiousness and sorcery destroyed everything.","1719":"During the war with Vespasian they the rabbis decreed against the use of crowns worn by bridegrooms and against the use of the bell. During the war with Quietus they decreed against the use of crowns worn by brides and that nobody should teach their child Greek. During the final war they decreed that a bride should not go out in a palanquin inside the city, but our rabbis decreed that a bride may go out in a palanquin inside the city.","1720":"When Rabbi Meir died, the composers of fables ceased. When Ben Azzai died, the diligent students of Torah ceased. When Ben Zoma died, the expounders ceased. When Rabbi Joshua died, goodness ceased from the world. When Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel died, locusts come and troubles multiplied. When Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah died, the sages ceased to be wealthy. When Rabbi Akiba died, the glory of the Torah ceased. When Rabbi Hanina ben Dosa died, men of wondrous deeds ceased. When Rabbi Yose Katnuta died, the pious men ceased and why was his name called Katnuta? Because he was the youngest of the pious men. When Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai died, the splendor of wisdom ceased. When Rabban Gamaliel the elder died, the glory of the torah ceased, and purity and separateness perished. When Rabbi Ishmael ben Fabi died, the splendor of the priesthood ceased. When Rabbi died, humility and fear of sin ceased. Rabbi Phineas ben Yair says: when Temple was destroyed, scholars and freemen were ashamed and covered their head, men of wondrous deeds were disregarded, and violent men and big talkers grew powerful.  And nobody expounds, nobody seeks, and nobody asks.   Upon whom shall we depend? Upon our father who is in heaven. Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: from the day the Temple was destroyed, the sages began to be like scribes, scribes like synagogue-attendants, synagogue-attendants like common people, and the common people became more and more debased.  And nobody seeks. Upon whom shall we depend? Upon our father who is in heaven.  In the footsteps of the messiah insolence will increase and the cost of living will go up greatly; the vine will yield its fruit, but wine will be expensive; the government will turn to heresy, and there will be no one to rebuke; the meeting-place of scholars will be used for licentiousness; the Galilee will be destroyed, the Gablan will be desolated, and the dwellers on the frontier will go about begging from place to place without anyone to take pity on them; the wisdom of the learned will rot, fearers of sin will be despised, and the truth will be lacking; youths will put old men to shame, the old will stand up in the presence of the young, \u201cFor son spurns father, daughter rises up against mother, daughter-in-law against mother-in-law a man\u2019s own household are his enemies\u201d (Micah 7:6). The face of the generation will be like the face of a dog, a son will not feel ashamed before his father. Upon whom shall we depend? Upon our father who is in heaven. Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair says, \u201cHeedfulness leads to cleanliness, cleanliness leads to purity, purity leads to separation, separation leads to holiness, holiness leads to modesty, modesty leads to fear of sin, fear of sin leads to piety, piety leads to the Holy Spirit, The Holy Spirit leads to the resurrection of the dead, and the resurrection of the dead comes from Elijah, blessed be his memory, Amen.\u201d","1721":"Fifteen categories of women exempt their rival wives and the rival wives of their rival wives and so on ad infinitum from halitzah and from yibbum.

How is it that if they had died, their rivals are permitted? If a man\u2019s daughter or any other of these forbidden relatives was married to his brother who also had another wife, and his daughter died or was divorced, and afterwards his brother died, her rival is permitted. The rival of any one who can make a declaration of refusal but did not make a declaration of refusal, must perform halitzah and may not have yibbum.","1723":"There are six relatives that are more restricted than these, in that they may be married only to strangers, marriage with their rivals is permitted:   his mother and his father\u2019s wife, his father\u2019s sister, his paternal sister, his father\u2019s brother\u2019s wife and his paternal brother\u2019s wife.","1724":"Beth Shammai permits the rival wives to the surviving brothers, and Beth Hillel prohibits them. If they perform the halitzah, Beth Shammai disqualifies them from marrying a priest,  and Beth Hillel makes the eligible.

Though these forbid and these permit, and these disqualify and these make eligible, Beth Shammai did not refrain from marrying women from the families of Beth Hillel, nor did Beth Hillel refrain from marrying women from the families of Beth Shammai.

If he had only had ma\u2019amar with her and died, the stranger is to perform halitzah but may not be taken in yibbum.","1741":"Three brothers:  two of whom were married to two sisters and the third was married to a stranger:  If one of the sisters\u2019 husband died and the brother who was married to the stranger married his wife, and then the wife of the second brother died, and afterwards the brother who was married to the stranger died, behold she is forbidden to him forever, since she was forbidden to him for one moment. Three brothers:  two of whom were married to two sisters and the third was married to a stranger.  If one of the sisters\u2019 husbands divorced his wife, and then the brother who was married to the stranger died, and he who had divorced his wife married her and then died,- this is a case concerning which they said:  If any of them died or were divorced, their rivals are permitted.","1742":"If in any of these cases the betrothal or divorce was in doubt, behold, these rivals must perform halitzah but may not be taken in yibbum. What is a case of doubtful betrothal? If when he threw to her betrothal money it was uncertain whether it fell nearer to him or nearer to her \u2013 this is a case of doubtful betrothal. What is a case of doubtful divorce? If he wrote a get in his own handwriting and it bore no signatures of witnesses, or if it bore signatures of witnesses but was note dated, or if it was dated but had the signature of only one witness this is a case of doubtful divorce.","1743":"Three brothers were married to three women who were strangers to one another and one of them died and the second brother did ma\u2019amar with her and then he died, behold, these must perform halitzah but may not be taken in yibbum; for it is said \u201cAnd one of them died\u2026her husband\u2019s brother shall unite with her\u201d only she who is bound due to one yavam but not she who is bound to due to two yavamim. R. Shimon says: he may have yibbum with whichever of these he wishes and then perform halitzah for the other. If two brothers were married to two sisters, and one of the brothers died, and afterwards the wife of the second brother died, behold, she is forbidden to him   forever, since she was forbidden to him for one moment.","1744":"If two men betrothed two women, and as they were entering into the bridal chamber, they exchanged the one for the other, behold, they are guilty of having relations with a married woman. If they were brothers they are guilty of having relations with a brother\u2019s wife. If they were sisters, they are guilty of having relations with a wife\u2019s sister. If they were menstruants they are guilty of having relations with a menstruant. They must be kept apart for three months, lest they are pregnant. If they were minors incapable of bearing children, they may be returned to their rightful husband at once. If the women were of priestly families they are disqualified from eating terumah.","1745":"A yavam performs halitzah for his yevamah, and she is subsequently found to be pregnant and she gives birth:If the child is viable, he is permitted to marry her relatives and she is permitted to marry his relatives, and he does not disqualify her from marrying a priest. If the child is not viable, he is forbidden to marry her relatives and she is forbidden to marry his relatives, and he disqualifies her from marrying a priest.","1746":"A yavam marries his yevamah and she is subsequently found to be pregnant, and she gives birth:If the child is viable, he must divorce her and both are obligated to bring a sacrifice; If the child is not viable, he may retain her as a wife. If it is doubtful whether it is a nine-months child of the first husband or a seven-months child of the second husband he must divorce her, and the child is legitimate, and they must bring an asham talui.","1747":"If a shomeret yavam came into possession of money: Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel agree that she may sell it or give it away, and that her act is legally valid. If she dies, what shall be done with her ketubah and with property that comes in and goes out with her? Beth Shammai says: the heirs of her husband are to share it with the heirs of her father; Beth Hillel says: the property is to remain with those in whose possession it is, the ketubah is to remain in the possession of the heirs of the husband and the property which comes in and goes out with her remains in the possession of the heirs of her father.","1748":"If he married her she is his wife in every respect save that her ketubah remains a debt on her first husband\u2019s estate.","1749":"The commandment of yibbum is upon the eldest of the surviving brothers.

Judah said: in either case, if the father was living the estate belongs to the father. He who performs halitzah with his yevamah, he is forbidden to marry her relatives and she is forbidden to marry his relatives: He is forbidden to marry her mother, her mother\u2019s mother and her father\u2019s mother; her daughter, her daughter\u2019s daughter and her son\u2019s daughter; and also her sister while she is alive. She is forbidden to marry his father and his father\u2019s father; his son and his son\u2019s son; his brother and his brother\u2019s son.

Similarly if a man divorces his wife and his brother marries her sister and dies behold she is exempt from halitzah and from yibbum.","1753":"If the brother of the yavam had betrothed the sister of the shomeret yavam, in the name of Rabbi Judah ben Batera they said:  they say to him \u201cWait until your older brother has done something\u201d. If his brother performed halitzah for her or married her, he may marry his betrothed wife. If the yevamah died he may marry his betrothed wife. If the yavam died, he must divorce his wife with a get and release his brother\u2019s wife by halitzah.","1754":"The yevamah shall neither perform halitzah nor be taken in yibbum before three months have passed since her husband\u2019s death. Similarly all other women shall be neither be betrothed nor married before three months have passed. Whether they were virgins or non-virgins, whether divorcees or widows, whether married or betrothed. Rabbi Judah said: those who were married may be betrothed immediately, and those who were betrothed may be married immediately, with the exception of the betrothed women in Judea, because there the bridegroom was intimate with his bride. Rabbi Yose said: all married women may be betrothed immediately with the exception of the widow because of her mourning.","1755":"If four brothers were married to four women, and they died, if the eldest surviving brother desires he may contract yibbum with all of them. If a man was married to two women and died, sexual relations or halitzah with one of them exempts her rival. If one of them was eligible to marry a priest and one ineligible to marry a priest, then if he performs halitzah it should be to her who is ineligible, and if he contracts yibbum it may be with her who is eligible.","1756":"A man who remarried his divorced wife, or married his halutzah, or married the relative of his halutzah must divorce her, and the child is a mamzer; the words of Rabbi Akiva. But the Sages say: the child is not a mamzer. They agree that where a man married the relative of his divorcee the child is a mamzer.","1757":"Who is a mamzer? The offspring of a union with any relative with whom cohabitation is forbidden, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Shimon the Yemenite says: The offspring of any union for which one is obligated kareth at the hands of heaven; and the halachah is like his words. Rabbi Joshua says: The offspring of any union for which one is obligated death at the hands of a court.Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai said: I found a scroll of genealogical records in Jerusalem, and it was written on it, \u201cSo-and-so is a mamzer having been born from an adulterous woman\u201d, which confirms the view of Rabbi Joshua. If a man\u2019s wife died, he is permitted to marry her sister. If he divorced her and then she died he is permitted to marry her sister. If she was married to another man and died, he is permitted to marry her sister. If a man\u2019s sister-in-law died, he may marry her sister. If he performed for her halitzah and then she died, he is permitted to marry her sister.","1758":"Rabban Gamaliel says: There is no validity to a get given after a get, nor to a ma\u2019amar after a ma\u2019amar, nor to an act of sexual intercourse after another act of sexual intercourse, nor to a halitzah after another halitzah. However, the Sages say:  There is validity to a get given after a get, and to a ma\u2019amar after a ma\u2019amar but not to an act of sexual intercourse after another act of sexual intercourse, or to a halitzah after another halitzah.","1759":"How is the release from yibbum effected?If he performed ma'amar for his yevamah and gave her a get, she requires halitzah. If he performed ma'amar and and did halizah, she requires a get. If he performed ma\u2019amar and then had intercourse with her, behold this is in accordance with the commandment.","1760":"If the yavam gave her a get and then ma\u2019amar, she needs another get and halitzah. If he gave her a get and then had intercourse with her, she needs another get and halitzah. If he gave her a get and then did halitzah, there is nothing after halitzah. If the yavam did halitzah and then he did ma\u2019amar or gave her a get, or had intercourse with her; Or if he had intercourse with her and then did ma\u2019amar, or gave her a get, or did halitzah, there is nothing after halitzah. And the law is the same whether there is one yevamah to one yavam or two yevamoth to one yavam.","1761":"How is this so?If the yavam did ma'amar with this one and ma'amar with the other one, they need two letters of divorce and one of them must have halizah. If he did ma'amar with one and gave a get to the other, the first one needs a get and one of them must have halitzah. If he did ma'amar with one and had intercourse with the other, they need two gets and one of them must have halitzah. If he had ma'amar with one and gave halitzah to the other, the first needs a get. If he gave a get to one and a get to the other, one of them requires halitzah. If he gave a get to one and had intercourse with the other, the second one requires a get and one of them must have halitzah. If he gave a get to one and had ma'amar with the other, the second requires a get and one of them must have halitzah. If he gave a get to one and halizah to the other, there is nothing after halitzah.","1762":"If he performed halitzah for one and then performed halitzah for the other, Or performed halitzah for one and did ma'amar with the other, or gave her get, or had intercourse with her; Or if he had intercourse with one and then with the other, Or had intercourse with one and then ma'amar with the other, or gave her a get, or performed halitzah there is nothing after halitzah. There is no difference in the law whether there was one yavam to two yevamoth or two yavamim to yevamah.","1763":"If the yavam performed halitzah and then did ma\u2019amar, gave her a get, or had intercourse with her; Or if he had intercourse with her and then did ma'amar, gave her a get, or performed halitzah, there is no valid act after halitzah,Whether it was performed in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. Concerning intercourse, if it took place first there is no valid act after it; If it occurred in the middle or at the end there can be a valid act after it. Rabbi Nehemiah says: with both intercourse and halizah, whether it took place in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end, there is no validity in any act that follows it.","1764":"One who has intercourse with his yevamah, whether in error or with presumption, whether under compulsion or of his own free will, even if he acted in error and she in presumption, or he in presumption and she in error, or he under compulsion and she not under compulsion, or she under compulsion and he not under compulsion, whether he only began to have intercourse or he completed having intercourse, he has acquired her as a wife. The laws do not make a distinction between different types of intercourse.","1765":"Similarly, one who has intercourse with any of the forbidden relatives listed in the Torah, or with any of those who are disqualified to marry him as, for instance, a widow to a high priest, a divorced woman or a halutzah to a common priest, a mamzeret or a netinah to an Israelite or the daughter of an Israelite to a mamzer or a nathin, he has disqualifed her from marrying a priest, and the laws do not make a distinction between different types of intercourse.","1766":"A widow to a high priest, a divorced woman or a halutzah to an ordinary priest they do not eat terumah from the point of betrothal. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon declare them eligible. If they became widows or were divorced after full marriage they are ineligible; If after betrothal they are eligible.","1767":"A high priest shall not marry a widow whether she became a widow after a betrothal or after a marriage. He shall not marry one who has reached puberty. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon permit him to marry one who has reached puberty, but he may not marry one who lost her virginity through a stick. A priest who betrothed a widow, and was subsequently appointed high priest, may bring her into marriage. It once happened with Joshua ben Gamla that he betrothed Marta the daughter of Boethus, and the king appointed him high priest, and he brought her into marriage. If a shomeret yavam became liable to have yibbum with an ordinary priest and then he was appointed high priest, even though he already did ma\u2019amar, he may not bring her into marriage. A high priest whose brother died must perform halitzah but may not contract yibbum.","1768":"An ordinary priest shall not marry a woman incapable of procreation, unless he already has a wife or children. Rabbi Judah said: even though he has a wife and children he shall not marry a woman incapable of procreation, since she is a zonah, as mentioned in the Torah. But the Sages said: the term zonah implies only a female convert, freed slavewoman   and one who has been subjected to illicit intercourse.","1769":"A man shall not abstain from procreation unless he already has children. Beth Shammai says: two males, And Beth Hillel says: male and a female, for it says, \u201cMale and female created he them\u201d (Genesis 5:2). If a man married a woman and lived with her for ten years and she bore no child, he may not abstain any longer from the duty of propagation. If he divorced her she is permitted to marry another, and the second husband may also live with her for ten years. If she miscarried the period of ten years is counted from the time of her miscarriage. A man is commanded concerning the duty of propagation but not a woman. Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka says: Concerning both of them it is said, \u201cAnd God blessed them; and said to them\u2026 \u201cBe fruitful and multiply\u201d (Genesis 1:28).","1770":"If a widow who married a high priest, or if a divorced woman or a halutzah who married an ordinary priest brought in to her husband melog slaves and tzon barzel  slaves, the melog slaves may not eat terumah but the tzon barzel slaves may eat of it. The following are melog slaves: those who, if they die, are the wife\u2019s loss and, if their value increases, are her profit. Even though it is the husband's duty to maintain them, they may not eat terumah. The following are tzon barzel slaves: if they die, they are the loss of the husband and, if their value increases, they are a profit to him. Since he is responsible for them,  they are permitted to eat terumah.","1771":"If the daughter of an Israelite was married to a priest, and she brought him in slaves, they are permitted to eat terumah whether they are melog slaves, or tzon barzel slaves. If the daughter of a priest was married to an Israelite and she brought him in slaves, they may not eat terumah whether they are melog slaves or tzon barzel slaves.","1772":"If the daughter of an Israelite was married to a priest who died and left her pregnant, her slaves may not eat terumah because of the share of the fetus, since a fetus prevents its mother from eating terumah but does not cause her to be able to eat terumah, the words of Rabbi Yose. They said to him: since you have testified to us concerning the daughter of an Israelite who was married to a priest, even concerning the daughter of a priest who was married to a priest, and he died and left her pregnant her slaves may not eat terumah because of the share of the fetus!","1773":"A fetus, a yavam, betrothal, a deaf-mute, and a boy who is nine years and one day old, disqualify a woman from terumah, but do not allow her to eat terumah, If it is doubtful whether the boy is nine years and one day old or not, or whether he   has produced two hairs or not, If a house collapsed upon a man and upon his brother\u2019s daughter, and it is not known which of them died first, her rival must perform halitzah but may not be taken in yibbum.","1774":"The rapist, the seducer and the insane man neither disqualify a woman from eating terumah nor do they allow her to eat terumah.If they are unfit to enter into the assembly of Israel they do disqualify a woman from eating terumah. How is this so?  If an Israelite had intercourse with the daughter of a priest she continues to eat terumah.If she becomes pregnant she may no longer eat terumah.Even if she becomes pregnant she may not eat.And if his father\u2019s mother was the daughter of an Israelite married to a priest, she may not eat terumah;And if his mother\u2019s mother was the daughter of an Israelite married to a priest, she may eat terumah; If the embryo was miscarried in her womb she may eat. If a priest had intercourse with the daughter of an Israelite, she may not eat terumah.If she gave birth may eat.A slave disqualifies a woman from eating terumah through intercourse but not as her offspring.If she was the daughter of a priest married to an Israelite she may eat terumah.If she was the daughter of a priest married to an Israelite she may not eat terumah. It is found that the power of the son is greater than that of the father. How is this so?  If the daughter of an Israelite was married to a priest or the daughter of a priest was married to an Israelite, and she bore a son by him, and the son went and had intercourse with a slave-woman who bore a son by him, such a son is a slave;A mamzer disqualifies a woman from eating terumah and can allow her to eat terumah. How is this so?  If the daughter of an Israelite was married to a priest or the daughter of a priest was married to an Israelite, and she bore a daughter by him, and the daughter went and married a slave or a Gentile who bore a son by him, such a son is a mamzer;","1775":"A high priest sometimes disqualifies his mother\u2019s mother from being able to eat terumah. How is this so? If a priest\u2019s daughter was married to an Israelite and she bore a daughter by him, and the daughter went and married a priest and bore a son by him, such a son is fit to be a high priest, to stand and serve at the altar. He allows his mother to eat terumah but disqualifies his mother\u2019s mother. And she can say, \u201cMay there not be like my grandson the high priest who disqualified me from eating terumah.\u201d","1776":"An uncircumcised priest and all impure persons may not eat terumah. Their wives and slaves may eat terumah. A priest whose testes are crushed or whose member is cut off, as well as their slaves, may eat terumah, but their wives may not. If, however, he did not know her after the his testes were crushed or his member was cut off, the wives may eat terumah.","1777":"Who is considered a \u201cpetzua dakkah\u201d? Anyone whose testes are wounded even one of them. And a \u201ckerut shofkhah\u201d? A man whose member is cut off. If any part of the corona remained, even so much as a hair\u2019s breadth, the man is regarded as fit to serve as a priest. A man who testes are wounded, and one whose member is cut off, are permitted to marry a convert or a freed slave. They are only forbidden to enter into the congregation, as it is said \u201cNo one whose testes are crushed or whose member is cut off shall be admitted into the congregation of the Lord\u201d (Deuteronomy 23:2).","1778":"An Ammonite and a Moabite are forbidden to enter into the congregation of the Lord and their prohibition is for ever. However, their women are permitted at once. An Egyptian and an Edomite are forbidden only until the third generation, whether they are males or females. Rabbi Shimon permits their women immediately. Said Rabbi Shimon:  This is a kal vehomer: if where the males are forbidden for all time the females are permitted immediately, where the males are forbidden only until the third generation how much more should the females be permitted immediately. They said to him:  If this is a halakhah, we shall accept it; but if it is only a logical reference, there is a refutation. He replied: This is not so, I am in fact saying a halakhah. Mamzerim and nethinim are forbidden, and their prohibition is forever, whether they be males or females.","1779":"Rabbi Joshua said:  I have heard that a eunuch performs halitzah and that halitzah is performed by others for his wife, and also that a eunuch does not perform halitzah and that no halitzah is performed for his wife, and I am unable to explain this. Rabbi Akiva said:  I will explain it: a man-made eunuch performs halitzah and halitzah is also performed for his wife, because there was a time when he was fit to have children. A eunuch by nature neither performs halitzah nor is halitzah performed for his wife, since there never was a time when he was fit. Rabbi Eliezer said: Not so!  Rather a eunuch by nature performs halitzah and halitzah is performed for his wife, because he may be cured. A man-made eunuch neither performs halitzah nor is halitzah performed for his wife, since he cannot be cured. Rabbi Joshua ben Baterra testified concerning Ben Megusat, who was a man-made eunuch living in Jerusalem and they performed yibbum for his wife, thus confirming the opinion of Rabbi Akiva.","1780":"The eunuch neither performs halitzah nor contracts yibbum. So too a woman who is incapable of procreation neither performs halizah nor is taken in yibbum. If a eunuch performed halitzah for his yevamah, he does not disqualify her from subsequently marrying a priest. If he has intercourse with her he disqualifies her, since this is an act of fornication. Similarly where brothers performed halitzah for a woman incapable of procreation, they do not disqualify her from marrying a priest. If they have intercourse with her they do disqualify her, since this is an act of fornication.","1781":"If a priest who was eunuch by nature married the daughter of an Israelite, he confers upon her the right to eat terumah. Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon stated: if a priest who was an hermaphrodite married the daughter of an Israelite, he confers upon her the right to eat terumah. Rabbi Judah stated: if a tumtum was opened up and found to be a male, he may not perform halitzah, because he has the same status as a eunuch. The hermaphrodite may marry a wife but may not be married by a man. Rabbi Eliezer stated: concerning the hermaphrodite, the one who has relations with him is liable to be stoned like one who has relations with a male.","1782":"Some women are permitted  to their husbands and forbidden to their yevamim, Others are permitted to their yevamim and forbidden to their husbands, Others are permitted to both, Others are forbidden to both.In all these cases the women are permitted  to their husbands and forbidden  to their yevamim. These are the women who are permitted to their husbands and forbidden to their yevamim: An ordinary priest married a widow and had a brother who was a high priest; A halal married a woman who was fit and had a brother of legitimate status; An Israelite married the daughter of an Israelite and had a brother who was a mamzer, A mamzer married a mamzeret and had a brother who was an Israelite.","1783":"The following  are permitted to their yevamim and forbidden to their husbands:A high priest who betrothed a widow and has a brother who is an ordinary priest; A fit priest who married a halalah and has a brother who is a halal; An Israelite who married a mamzeret and has a brother who is a mamzeret; A mamzer who married the daughter of an Israelite and has a brother who is an Israelite. In these cases the women are permitted to their yevamim and forbidden to their husbands. The following are forbidden to both; A high priest who married a widow has a brother who is a high priest, or who is an ordinary priest; A fir priest who married a halalah and has a brother who was a fit priest; An Israelite who married a mamzeret and has a brother who is Israelite; A mamzer who married the daughter of an Israelite and has a brother who is a mamzer, In these cases the women are forbidden to both the husband and the yavam.

She cannot claim her ketubah or usufruct or support money, or her worn clothes. The child is fit to marry a priest, but the husband is compelled to divorce her. A widow who was married to a high priest, a divorcee or halutzah who was married to an ordinary priest, a mamzer or a netinah who was married to an Israelite, or the daughter of an Israelite who was married to a natin or a mamzer is entitled to her ketubah.","1785":"The daughter of an Israelite who was betrothed to a priest, or who was pregnant from a priest, or was a shomeret yavam to a priest; And similarly, the daughter of a priest who was in such relationship with an Israelite, may not eat terumah.

She has no ketubah, no usufruct, no support money or worn clothes, neither from this one nor from that one. If she has taken anything from this one or that one, she must return it. The child from this one or that one is a mamzer. Neither this one nor that one may impurify himself for her. Neither this one and that one has a claim to whatever she may find, nor what she makes with her hands, nor to invalidate her vows. If she was the daughter of an Israelite, she becomes disqualified from marrying a priest; if the daughter of a Levite, from the eating of tithe; and if the daughter of a priest, from the eating of terumah. Neither the heirs of this one nor the heirs of that one are entitled to inherit her ketubah. And if the husbands die, the brother of the one and the brother of the other must perform halitzah, but may not contract yibbum. Rabbi Yose said: her ketubah remains a charge upon the estate of her first husband. Rabbi Elazar said: the first husband is entitled to whatever she may find, and what she makes with her hands, and also has the right to invalidate her vows. Rabbi Shimon said: intercourse or halitzah with the brother of the first husband exempts her rival, and the child from him is not a bastard. If she married without an authorization, she may return to him.","1789":"If she married with the authorization of the court, she must leave, but is exempt from bringing a sacrifice. If she married without the authorization of the court, she must leave and is liable to bring a sacrifice. The authority of the court is thus more greater in that it exempts her from the sacrifice. If the court ruled that she may be married and she went and disgraced herself, she   must bring a sacrifice, because the court permitted her only to marry.","1790":"If a woman whose husband and son went to a country beyond the sea was told, \u201cYour husband died and your son died afterwards\u201d, and she married again, and later she was told, \u201cthe deaths happened in the opposite order\u201d she must leave, and any child born before or after is a mamzer. If she was told \u201cYour son died and your husband died afterwards\u201d, and she had yibbum, and afterwards she was told, \u201cthe deaths happened in the opposite order\u201d she must leave, and any child born before or after is a mamzer. If she was told, \u201cYour husband died\u201d, and she married, and afterwards she was told, \u201cHe was alive but is now dead\u201d, she must leave, and any child born before the death of her first husband is a mamzer, but one born after it is not a mamzer. If she was told, \u201cYour husband died\u201d, and she was betrothed, and afterwards her husband appeared, she is permitted to return to him. Although the second one gave her a get he has not thereby disqualified her from marrying a priest. This Rabb Elazar ben Mathia expounded: \u201cA woman divorced from her husband\u201d not from a man who is not her husband.","1791":"If a man\u2019s wife had gone to a country beyond the sea and he was told, \u201cYour wife is dead\u201d, and he married her sister, and afterwards his wife came back, the latter is permitted to return to him. He is permitted to marry the relatives of the second woman, and the second woman is permitted to marry his relatives. If the first wife died he is permitted to marry the second. If he was told that his wife was dead, and he married her sister, and then he was told that she was then alive but had since died, any child born before his first wife\u2019s death is a mamzer, but anyone born after her death is not a mamzer. Rabbi Yose says:  whoever disqualifies for others disqualifies for himself and whoever does not disqualify for others does not disqualify for himself.","1792":"If a man was told \u201cYour wife is dead\u201d and he married her paternal sister; and when he was told \u201cShe is dead\u2019, he married her maternal sister; and when he was told \u201cShe is dead\u201d, and he married her paternal sister; and when he was told \u201cShe is dead, he married her maternal sister; and later it was found that they were all alive, he is permitted to the first, third and fifth, and they exempt their rivals; But he is forbidden to the second and the fourth, and intercourse with one of these does not exempt her rival. If he had intercourse with the second after the death of the first, he is permitted to the second and fourth, and they exempt their rivals; But he is forbidden to the third and the fifth, and intercourse with one of these does not exempt her rival.","1793":"A boy of the age of nine years and one day disqualifies his sister-in-law for marriage with his brothers, and his brothers disqualify her for him, but while he disqualifies her from the outset only, the brothers disqualify her from the outset and at the end. How is this so?   A boy of the age of nine years and one day who had intercourse with his sister-in-law disqualifies her for marriage with his brothers; The brothers disqualify her for marriage with him whether they had intercourse with her, did ma\u2019amar, gave her a get or submitted to her halitzah.","1794":"If a boy of the age of nine years and one day had intercourse with his yevamah and then his brother who was of the age of nine years and one day had intercourse with her, the latter disqualifies her for the former. Rabbi Shimon says: he does not render her unfit.","1795":"If a boy of the age of nine years and one day had intercourse with his yevamah and afterwards had intercourse with her rival wife, he has disqualified both women for marriage with himself. Rabbi Shimon says: he does not disqualify them. If a boy of the age of nine years and one day had intercourse with his yevamah and then died, she must undergo halitzah but may not be taken in yibbum. If he had married any other woman and she subsequently died, she is exempt from both halitzah and yibbum.","1796":"If a boy of the age of nine years and one day had intercourse with his sister-in-law, and after he had come of age he married another woman and then died, if he had not known the first woman after he had become of age, the first one must have halitzah but may not be taken in yibbum, while the second may either have halitzah or yibbum. Rabbi Shimon says: the yavam may perform yibbum with whichever one he wants, and he must perform halitzah for the other woman. The same law applies whether he is of the age of nine years and one day, or whether he is of the age of twenty years but had not produced two pubic hairs.","1797":"A man is permitted to marry the relative of a woman whom he has raped or seduced. He who rapes or seduces a relative of his married wife, is guilty. A man may marry a woman whom his father has raped or seduced or a woman whom his son has raped or seduced. Rabbi Yehudah forbids marriage with a woman whom one\u2019s father has raped or seduced.","1798":"The sons of a female convert who converted with her do not perform halitzah or yibbum, even if the one was not conceived in holiness but was born in holiness, and the other was both conceived and born in holiness. So also is the law where the sons of a female slave were freed together with her.","1799":"If the children of five women were mixed up and, when these mixed up children grew up, they took wives and then died, four perform halitzah for one of the widows and one contracts with her yibbum. Then he and three brothers perform halitzah to another one of the widows and one has with her yibbum. Thus every one of the widows has halitzah four times and yibbum once.","1800":"If the child of a woman was mixed up with the child of her daughter-in-law and the mixed-up children grew up and married women and then died, the other sons of the daughter-in-law perform halitzah but may not contract yibbum, for it is uncertain whether she is the wife of his brother or the wife of his father\u2019s brother. The other sons of the older woman either perform halitzah or yibbum, since the only doubt is whether she is the wife of his brother or the wife of his brother\u2019s son. If the not-mixed-up sons died then with respect to the widows of the sons of the older woman the mixed-up sons perform halitzah and may not have yibbum, since it is uncertain whether she is the wife of his brother or the wife of his father\u2019s brother; With respect to the widows of the sons of the daughter-in-law one performs halitzah and the other may have yibbum.","1801":"If the child of a priest\u2019s wife was mixed-up with the child of her female slave, behold both may eat terumah and together they receive one share at the threshing-floor. They may not defile themselves for the dead nor may they marry any women whether these are eligible for marriage with a priest or ineligible. If when they grew up, the mixed-up children freed one another they may marry women who are eligible for marriage with a priest and they may not defile themselves for the dead.  If they defiled themselves, they do not receive the penalty of forty lashes. They may not eat terumah, but if they did eat they need not pay compensation either for the principal or the additional fifth.  They are not to receive a share at the threshing-floor, but they may sell their own terumah and the proceeds are theirs.  They receive no share in the holy things of the temple, and no holy things are given to them but others do not take their holy things from them.   They are exempt from giving to any priest the shoulder, the cheeks and the maw, while the firstling of either of them should remain in the pasture until it contracts a blemish. The restrictions relating to priests and the restrictions relating to Israelites are both imposed upon them.","1802":"If a woman did not wait three months after separation from her husband, and married again and gave birth to a son, and it is unknown whether it is a nine-months child by the first husband or a seven-months child by the second, if she had other sons by the first husband and other sons by the second, these must perform halitzah but may not contract yibbum. So too he, with their widows performs halitzah but may not contract yibbum. If he had brothers by the first and also brothers by the second,  but not by the same mother, he may either perform halitzah or contract yibbum, But as for them, one performs halitzah and the other may then contract yibbum.","1803":"If one of the two husbands was an Israelite and the other a priest: He may only marry a woman who is eligible to marry a priest. He may not defile himself for the dead,  but if he did defile himself he does not suffer the penalty of forty stripes. He may not eat terumah, but if he did eat he need not pay compensation either for the principal or for the additional fifth. He does not receive a share at the threshing-floor, but he may sell his own terumah   and the profits are his. He receives no share in the holy things of the temple, no holy things are given to him, but he is not deprived of his own. He is exempt from giving to any priest the shoulder, the cheeks and the maw, while his firstling must remain in the pasture until it contracts a blemish. The restrictions relating to priests and the restrictions relating to Israelites are imposed upon him. If the two husbands were priests: He must be an onen mourner for them and they must be onenim mourners for him, but he may not defile himself for them, nor may they defile themselves for him. He may not inherit from them, but they may inherit from him. He is exempt if he strikes or curses the one or the other. He goes up to serve in the Temple watch of the one as well as of the other, but he does not receive a share in the offerings. If both served in the same watch, he receives a single portion.","1804":"The commandment of halitzah must be performed in the presence of three judges, even though all the three are laymen. If the woman performed the halitzah with a shoe, her halitzah is valid, but if with a felt sock it is invalid. If with a sandal to which a heel is attached it is valid, but if with one that has no heel it is invalid. If the sandal was tied below the knee the halitzah is valid, but if above the knee it is invalid.","1805":"If the woman performed the halitzah with a sandal that did not belong to him, or with a wooden sandal, or with the one of the left foot which he was wearing on his right foot, the halitzah is valid. If she performed the halizah with a sandal too large for him, in which, however, he is able to walk, or with one too small which, however, covers the greater part of his foot, her halizah is valid. If she performed the halitzah at night, her halitzah is valid. Rabbi Elazar disqualifies halitzah at night. If she performed it with the yavam\u2019s left shoe, her halitzah is invalid, Rabbi Elazar validates it.","1806":"If she took off his shoe and spat, but did not recite the formula, her halitzah is valid. If she recited the formula and spat, but did not draw off the shoe, her halitzah is invalid. If she drew off the shoe and recited the formula but did not spit: R. Eliezer says her halitzah is invalid; and R. Akiva says: her halitzah is valid. R. Eliezer said to him: \u201c\u2018So shall be done\u2019 (Deut. 25:9), anything which is a deed is essential.\u201d R. Akiva said to him: \u201cFrom there is your proof!: \u2018So shall be done to the man\u201d,  only that which is to be done to the man is essential.","1807":"If a deaf yavam submitted to halitzah or if a deaf yevamah performed halitzah, or if a halitzah was performed on a minor, the halizah is invalid. If a minor yevamah performed halitzah she must again perform halitzah when she becomes of age; if she does not again perform it, the halitzah is invalid.","1808":"If she performed halitzah in the presence of two men or in the presence of three men and one of them was discovered to be a relative or in any other way unfit to act as judge, her halitzah is invalid. R. Shimon and R. Yohanan Ha-Sandelar declare it valid. And it once happened that a man submitted to halitzah between himself and herself in a prison, and when the case came before R. Akiva he declared the halitzah valid.","1809":"This is the procedure in the performance of the commandment of halitzah:He and his deceased brother\u2019s wife come to the court, and they offer him appropriate advice, for it is said, \u201cThen the elders of his city shall call him and speak to him\u201d (Deut. 25:8). She then says: \u201cMy husband\u2019s brother refuses to establish a name for his brother in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a levir (yavam)\u201d (verse. Then he says: \u201cI do not wish to marry her\u201d (verse. These sayings were spoken in the holy tongue (Hebrew). \u201cThen his brother\u2019s widow shall go up to him in the presence of the elders, pull the sandal off his foot and spit in his face\u201d (verse spit that the judges can see. \u201cAnd make this declaration: Thus shall be done to the man who will not build up his brother\u2019s house\u201d. Thus far they used to dictate. When Rabbi Hyrkanus was under the terebinth at Kefar Etam he dictated the reading and completed the entire section, the practice was established to complete the entire section. \u201cAnd he shall go in Israel by the name of \u2018the family of the unsandaled one\u2019\u201d (verse. The recitation of this verse is a commandment to be performed by the judges and not by the disciples. Rabbi Judah says: it is a commandment incumbent upon all present to cry \u201cthe man that had his shoe pulled off, the man that had his shoe pulled off, the man that had his shoe pulled off.\u201d","1810":"Beth Shammai says:  Only those who are betrothed may exercise the right of refusal; But Beth hillel says:  Both those who are betrothed and those who are married. Beth Shammai says: A declaration of refusal may be made against a husband but not against a yavam; But Beth Hillel says: Either against a husband or against a yavam. Beth Shammai says: The declaration must be made in his presence, But Beth Hillel says: Either in his presence or not in his presence. Beth Shammai says: The declaration must be made before the court, But Beth Hillel says: Either before the court or not before the court. Beth Hillel said to Beth Shammai: A girl may exercise the right of refusal while she is a minor even four or five times. Beth Shammai said to them: \u201cThe daughters of Israel are not ownerless property!  Rather, either she makes a declaration of refusal and then waits until she is of age, or she makes a declaration of refusal and marries again immediately. Section one:  According to Beth Shammai only those who are betrothed are allowed to make a declaration of refusal and thereby leave their husbands without a get.  Beth Hillel says even if she was married she may do so.  According to the Talmud, Beth Shammai allows only the betrothed woman to refuse because if the married woman also was able to refuse, men would not want to spend the money involved in marrying a minor, lest she later refuse the marriage. Section two:  If the minor girl was married off by her mother or brother and then her husband died, according to Beth Shammai she cannot make a declaration against her yavam.  Rather she must wait until she reaches majority age and then request halitzah.  However, according to Beth Hillel she may make such a declaration against the yavam as well.  However, even though she has annulled her marriage to the yavam\u2019s brother, she cannot at a later point marry the yavam, since she was at one point his brother\u2019s wife. Section three:  According to Beth Shammai, she must make the declaration of refusal in front of him.  According to Beth Hillel, this is not necessary. Section four: According to Beth Shammai, she must make the declaration of refusal in front of a court.  According to Beth Hillel, this is not necessary. Section five:  According to Beth Hillel, as long as she is still a minor, she may be married off as many times as her brothers and mother wish and she may later refuse as many marriages as they offer.  Beth Shammai offers a moral objection to this possibility, for through it a girl could be betrothed to several men without ever having received a get.  Rather she either waits until she is an adult or makes a declaration of refusal and then marries immediately, at which point she could no longer refuse, according to Beth Shammai.  Note that this last section is phrased differently than the previous sections.  According to some mishnaic commentators, since Beth Shammai explains their position the halakhah is according to them in this section.  In all of the other sections, the halakhah follows Beth Hillel, as it usually does.","1811":"Which minor must make the declaration of refusal?Any whose mother or brothers have given her in marriage with her consent. If they gave her in marriage without her consent she need not make any declaration of refusal. Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says:  Any child who is unable to take care of her token of betrothal need not make any declaration of refusal. Rabbi Eliezer says:  The act of a minor has no validity at all, rather she is to be regarded as one seduced. The daughter of an Israelite who was married to a priest may not eat terumah, and the daughter of a priest who was married to an Israelite may eat terumah.","1812":"Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says:  In the case of any hindrance that was due to the husband, she is considered to be his wife; But in the case of any hindrance that was not due to the husband she is not considered to be his wife.","1813":"If a minor made a declaration of refusal against a man, he is permitted to marry her relatives and she is permitted to marry his relatives, and he does not disqualify her frommarrying a priest. If he gave her a get, he is forbidden to marry her relatives and she is forbidden to marry his relatives, and he also disqualifies her from marrying a priest. If he gave her a get and remarried her and then she a made a declaration of refusal against him, and then she was married to another man and became a widow or was divorced, she is permitted to return to him. If she made a declaration of refusal against him and then he remarried her, and then he gave her a get and then she was married to another man and became a widow or was divorced, she is forbidden to return to him. This is the general rule: if divorce followed meun she is forbidden to return to him,  and if meun followed divorce she is permitted to return to him.","1814":"If a minor made a declaration of refusal against a man, and then she was married to another man who divorced her, and afterwards to another man against whom she made a declaration of refusal, and then to another man who divorced her: she is forbidden to return to any man from whom she was separated by a get, but is permitted to return to any man from whom she was separated by her declaration of refusal.","1815":"If a man divorced his wife and remarried her, she is permitted to marry the yavam; Rabbi Elazar forbids. Similarly, if a man divorced an orphan and remarried her, she is permitted to marry the yavam; Rabbi Elazar forbids. If a minor was given in marriage by her father and was divorced she is like an orphan in her father\u2019s lifetime and then her husband remarried her, all agree that she is forbidden to marry the yavam.","1816":"If two brothers were married to two sisters who were minors and orphans, and the husband of one of them died, the widow is free since she is the the yavam\u2019s wife\u2019s sister. Similarly in the case of two deaf-mute sisters. If the two brothers were married to two sisters one of whom was of age and the other a minor, if the husband of the minor died, the minor is free since she is the the yavam\u2019s wife\u2019s sister. If the husband of the elder sister died: Rabbi Eliezer says the minor is to be instructed to make a declaration of refusal against him. Rabban Gamaliel says:  If she made a declaration of refusal, then she did so; but if she did not, let her wait until she is of age and then she will be free since she is the the yavam\u2019s wife's sister. Rabbi Joshua says:  Woe to him because of his wife and woe to him because of his brother\u2019s wife! He must allow his wife to go by giving her a get, and he must let go his brother\u2019s wife through halitzah.","1817":"If a man who was married to two minors orphans died, intercourse or halitzah with one of them exempts her rival. And the same is true with regard to two deaf women. If a man was married to a minor and to a deaf woman and then died, intercourse  with one of them does not exempt her rival. If one was of sound senses and one was deaf, intercourse with the woman of sound senses exempts the deaf woman, but intercourse with the deaf woman does not exempt the woman of sound senses. If one was of age and the other a minor, intercourse with the one of age exempts the minor, but intercourse with the minor does not exempt the one of age.","1818":"If a man who was married to two orphans who were minors died, and the yavam had intercourse with one, and then he also had intercourse with the other, or his the yavam\u2019s brother had intercourse with the other, he has not thereby disqualified the first for him; And the same is true with regard to two deaf women. If one was a minor and the other deaf, and the yavam had intercourse with the minor and then he had intercourse with the deaf widow, or a brother of his had intercourse with the deaf widow, he has not disqualified the minor for him. If the yavam had intercourse with the deaf widow and then he also had intercourse with the minor, or a brother of his had intercourse with the minor, he has disqualified the deaf widow for him.","1819":"If one was of sound senses and the other deaf, and the yavam had intercourse with the woman of sound senses and then he also had intercourse with the deaf woman, or a brother of his had intercourse with the deaf woman, he does not disqualify the former for him. If the yavam had intercourse with the deaf woman, and then he also had intercourse with the woman of sound senses, or a brother of his had intercourse with the woman of sound senses, he disqualifies the deaf woman for him.","1820":"If one was of age and the other a minor, and the yavam had intercourse with the one who was of age, and then he had intercourse with the minor, or a brother of his had intercourse with the minor, he does not disqualify the elder for him. If the yavam had intercourse with the minor, and then he also had intercourse with the one who was of age, or a brother of his had intercourse with the one who was of age, he disqualifies the minor for him. Rabbi Elazar says: the minor is to be instructed to make a declaration of refusal.","1821":"If a yavam who was a minor had intercourse with a yevamah who was a minor, they should be brought up together. If he had intercourse with a yevamah who was of age, she should bring him up until he is of age. If a yevamah declared within thirty days after yibbum, \u201che has not had intercourse with me\u201d, they force him to perform halitzah; If her declaration was made after thirty days, they request that he perform halitzah. If he admits that he did not have intercourse with her, they force him to perform halitzah.","1822":"If a woman vowed to have no benefit from her yavam:If the vow was made during the husband\u2019s lifetime they force him to perform halitzah, If her vow was made after the death of her husband, they request of him to perform halitzah. If this was her intention, even if her vow was made during the lifetime of her husband, they request of him to perform halitzah.","1823":"If a deaf man married a woman of sound senses or a man of sound senses married a deaf woman he may, if he wishes, divorce her, and he may, if he wishes retain her; just as he marries by gestures so he divorces her by gestures. If a man of sound senses married a woman of sound senses and she became deaf, he may, if he wishes, divorce her; and he may, if he wishes, retain her. If she became insane he may not divorce her. If he became deaf or insane, he may never divorce her. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: Why may a woman who became deaf be divorced while a man who became deaf may not divorce his wife? They answered him: a man who divorces is not like a woman who is divorced, for while a woman may be divorced with her consent and without her consent, a man can divorce only with his consent.","1824":"Rabbi Nehunia ben Gudgada testified concerning a deaf-mute whose father had given her in marriage, that she could be sent away with a bill of divorcement; They said to him: the other also is similar to her.","1825":"If two deaf brothers were married to two deaf sisters, or to two sisters who were of sound senses, or to two sisters one of whom was deaf and the other was of sound senses; And so also if two deaf sisters were married to two brothers who were of sound senses, or to two deaf brothers, or to two brothers one of whom was deaf and the other of sound senses: Behold these women are exempt from halitzah and from yibbum. If  the women were strangers they must marry them, and if they wish to divorce them, they may do so.","1826":"If two brothers, one of whom was deaf and the other of sound senses, were married to two sisters who were of sound senses, and the deaf brother, the husband of the sister who was of sound senses, died, what should the brother of sound senses, the husband of the sister of sound senses, do? Nothing, since she is exempt, because she is his wife\u2019s sister. If the brother of sound senses, the husband of the sister who was of sound senses, died, what should the deaf brother, the husband of the sister who was of sound senses, do? He must release his wife with a get, while his brother\u2019s wife is forbidden forever to marry again.","1827":"If two brothers of sound senses were married to two sisters one of whom was deaf and the other of sound senses, and the brother of sound senses, the husband of the deaf sister, died, what should the brother of sound senses, the husband of the sister who was of sound senses, do? Nothing, since she is exempt because she is his wife\u2019s sister. If the brother of sound senses, the husband of the sister who was of sound senses, died, what should the brother of sound senses, the husband of the deaf sister, do? He must release his wife with a get and his brother\u2019s wife by halitzah.","1828":"If two brothers, one of whom was deaf and the other of sound senses, were married to two sisters, one of whom was deaf and the other of sound senses, and the deaf brother, the husband of the deaf sister, died, what should the brother who was of sound senses, the husband of the sister who was of sound senses, do? Nothing, since she is exempt because she is his wife\u2019s sister. If the brother of sound senses, the husband of the sister who was of sound senses, died, what should the deaf brother, the husband of the deaf sister, do? He must release his wife with a get, while his brother\u2019s wife is forever forbidden to marry again.","1829":"If two brothers, one of whom was deaf and the other of sound senses, were married to two strangers who were of sound senses, and the deaf brother, the husband of the woman who was of sound senses, died, what should the brother of sound senses, the husband of the woman of sound senses, do? He either performs halitzah or yibbum. If the brother of sound senses, the husband of the woman who was of sound senses, died, what should the deaf brother, the husband of the woman who was of sound senses, do? He must marry her and he may never divorce her.","1830":"If two brothers of sound senses were married to two strangers, one of whom was of sound senses and the other deaf, and the brother of sound senses, the husband of the deaf woman died, what should the brother of sound senses, the husband of the woman of sound senses, do? He must marries her and if he wishes to divorce her he may do so. If the brother of sound senses, the husband of the woman of sound senses, died, what should the brother of sound senses, the husband of the deaf woman, do? He may either perform halitzah or yibbum.","1831":"If two brothers, one of whom was deaf and the other of sound senses, were married to two strangers, one of whom was deaf and the other of sound senses, and the deaf brother, the husband of the deaf woman, died, what should the brother of sound senses, the husband of the woman of sound senses do? He must marry her, but if he wishes to divorce her he may do so. If the brother of sound senses, the husband of the woman of sound senses, died, what should the deaf brother, the husband of the deaf woman, do? He must marry her and he may never divorce her.","1832":"If a woman and her husband went to a country beyond the sea at a time when there was peace between him and her and when there was also peace in the world, and she came back and said, \u201cMy husband is dead\u201d, she may marry again; and if she said, \u201cMy husband is dead and he had no children\u201d she may contract yibbum. If there was peace between him and her, but war in the world, or if there was discord between him and her, but peace in the world, and she came back and said, \u2018My husband is dead\u201d, she is not believed. Rabbi Judah says: she is never believed unless she comes weeping and her garments are rent. They said to him: she may marry in either case.","1833":"Bet Hillel says: we heard such a tradition only in respect of a woman who came from the harvest and whose husband died in the same country, and in a case similar to the one that happened. Bet Shammai said to them: the law is the same whether the woman came from the harvest or from olive picking, or from grape picking, or from one country to another--the Sages spoke of the harvest only because the incident to which they referred occurred then. Bet Hillel changed their view to rule in accordance with Bet Shammai.","1834":"Bet Shammai says:  she may marry and she receives her ketubah. Bet Hillel says: she may marry but she does not receive her ketubah. Bet Shammai said to them: you have permitted what might be the serious consequence of illicit intercourse, why should you not permit the taking of her husband\u2019s money which is of less consequence! Bet Hillel said to them: we find that based on her testimony, the brothers may not receive their inheritance. Bet Shammai said to them: do we not learn this from her ketubah scroll wherein her husband writes to her \u201cif you are married to another man, you will receive what is prescribed for you\u201d! Bet Hillel changed their view to rule in accordance with Bet Shammai.","1835":"All are believed to testify for her concerning her husband\u2019s death except for her mother-in-law, the daughter of her mother-in-law, her rival wife, her sister-in-law and her husband\u2019s daughter. Why is the bringing of a letter of divorce different from testifying regarding death?The written document provides the proof. If one witness stated, \u201che is dead\u201d, and his wife married again, and another came and stated \u201che is not dead\u201d, she need not leave her new husband. If one witness said \u201che is dead\u201d and two witnesses said \u201che is not dead\u201d, even if she married again, she must leave him. If two witnesses stated, \u201che is dead\u201d, and one witness stated, \u201che is not dead\u201d, even if she had not married, she may do so.","1836":"If one wife said \u201che is dead\u2019 and the other wife said, \u201che is not dead\u201d , the one who said, \u201che is dead\u201d may marry again and she also receives her ketubah, while the one who said, \u201che is not dead\u201d, may neither marry again nor does she receive her ketubah. If one wife said, \u201che is dead\u201d and the other stated \u201che was killed\u201d: Rabbi Meir says: since they contradict one another they may not marry again. Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Shimon say: since both admit that he is not alive, both may marry again. If one witness says, \u201che is dead\u201d, and another witness says \u201che is not dead\u2019, Or if one woman says \u201che is dead\u201d, and another woman says, \u201che is not dead\u2019, she may not marry again.","1837":"If a woman and her husband went to a country beyond the sea, and she returned and stated, \u201cmy husband is dead\u201d, she may be married again and she also receives her ketubah. However, her rival wife is forbidden to remarry.If her rival wife was the daughter of an Israelite who was married to a priest, she is permitted to eat terumah, the words of Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Akiva says: this is not a way that would lead her away from transgression, unless it be enacted that she shall be forbidden both to marry and to eat terumah.","1838":"If she stated, \u201cmy husband died first and my father-in-law died after him\u201d, she may marry again and she also receives her ketubah, but her mother-in-law is forbidden to remarry. If her mother-in-law was the daughter of an Israelite who was married to a priest, she is permitted to eat terumah, the words of Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Akiva says: this is not a way that would lead her away from transgression, unless it be enacted that she shall be forbidden both to marry and to eat terumah. If a man betrothed one of five women and he does not know which of them he has betrothed, and each states, \u201che has betrothed me\u201d, he gives a letter of divorce to every one of them,  and he leaves one ketubah sum for them and withdraws, the words of Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Akiva says: this is not a way that would lead him away from transgression, unless he gives to each of them both a get and a ketubah. If a man robbed one of five persons and does not know which of them he has robbed, and each one states, \u201che has robbed me\u201d, he leaves the amount of the robbery among them and withdraws, the words of Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Akiva says: this is not a way that would lead them away from transgression, unless one pays the full amount of the robbery to every one of the persons involved.","1839":"A woman who went with her husband to a country beyond the sea, and her son was with her, and who came back and stated, \u201cmy husband died and afterwards my son died\u201d, is believed. If she stated \u201cmy son died and afterwards my husband died\u201d, she is not believed, but we are concerned that her words might be true and she must, therefore, perform halitzah but may not contract yibbum.","1840":"If a woman states, \u201cA son was given to me while I was in a country beyond the sea\u201d and she also states, \u201cmy son died and afterwards my husband died\u201d, she is believed. If she states, \u201cmy husband died and afterwards my son died\u201d, she is not believed, but we are concerned that her words might be true and she must, therefore, perform halitzah but may not contract yibbum.","1841":"If a woman states \u201ca brother-in-law was given to me while I was in a country beyond the sea\u201d,  and afterwards she states, \u201cmy husband died and afterwards my brother-in-law died\u201d or \u201cmy brother-in-law died and afterwards my husband died\u201d, she is believed. If a woman and her husband and her brother-in-law went to a country beyond the sea, and she on returning home stated, \u201cmy husband died and afterwards my brother-in-law died\u201d or \u201cmy brother-in-law died and afterwards my husband died\u201d she is not believed; For a woman is not to be believed when she asserts \u201cmy brother-in-law is dead\u201d, in order that she may marry again; Nor is she believed when she states that her sister is dead, in order that she may enter his house. A man also is not believed when he states \u201cmy brother is dead\u201d, so that he may have yibbum with his wife, nor when he states that his wife is dead, in order that he may marry her sister.","1842":"A woman whose husband and rival wife went to a country beyond the sea, and to whom people came and said, \u201cyour husband is dead\u201d, must neither marry nor contract yibbum until she has ascertained whether her rival wife is pregnant. If she had a mother-in-law she need not be concerned she had another son. But if the mother-in-law departed while pregnant she must be concerned that another son was born. Rabbi Joshua says: she need not be concerned.","1843":"Two sisters-in-law, one says, \u201cMy husband is dead\u201d, and the other also says, \u201cMy husband is dead\u201d, this one is forbidden on account of the husband of this one, and this one is forbidden on account of the husband of this one. If one had witnesses and the other had no witnesses, she who has the witnesses is forbidden, while she who has no witnesses is permitted. If the one has children and the other has no children, she who has children is permitted and she who has no children is forbidden. If they contracted yibbum, and the yevamim died, they are forbidden to marry again. Rabbi Elazar says: since they were permitted to marry the yevamim, they are subsequently permitted to marry any man.","1844":"They are allowed to testify only about the face with the nose, even though there were also marks on the man\u2019s body or clothing. They are allowed to testify only when his soul has departed, even though they have seen him cut up or crucified or being devoured by a wild beast. They are allowed to testify only if they saw the body within three days of death. Rabbi Judah ben Baba says: not all men, all places, or all times are alike.","1845":"If a man fell into water, whether it had a visible end or not, his wife is forbidden to marry again. Rabbi Meir said: it once happened that a man fell into a large cistern and came out after three days. Rabbi Yose: it once happened that a blind man descended into a cave to immerse and his guide went down after him; and after waiting long enough for their souls to depart, permission was given to their wives to marry again. Another incident occurred at Asia where a man was lowered into the sea, and only his leg was brought up, and the Sages ruled: if the recovered leg contained the part above the knee the man\u2019s wife may marry again, but if it contained only the part below the knee, she may not marry again.","1846":"Even if he only heard from women saying, \u201cso-and-so is dead\u201d, this is enough. Rabbi Judah says: even if he only heard children saying, \u201cbehold we are going to mourn for a man named so-and-so and to bury him\u201d it is enough. Whether such statement was made with the intention of providing evidence or was made with no such intention it is valid. Rabbi Judah ben Bava says: with an Israelite the evidence is valid only if the man had the intention of acting as witness.  In the case of a non-Jew the evidence is invalid if his intention was to act as witness.","1847":"They may testify even if the body was seen in candle light or in moonlight. And a woman may be given permission to marry again on the evidence of a mere voice. It once happened that a man was standing on the top of a hill and cried, \u201cso-and-so son of so-and-so from such-and-such a place is dead\u201d, but when they went to the top of the hill they didn\u2019t find anyone there.  Nevertheless, they allowed his wife to remarry. In another instance, at Zalmon a person declared, \u201cI am so-and-so son of so-and-so; a snake has bitten me, and I am dying\u201d; and when they went to examine the corpse they did not recognize him, they nevertheless allowed his wife to remarry.","1848":"Rabbi Akiva said: When I went down to Nehardea to intercalate the year, I met Nehemiah of Bet D\u2019li who said to me, \u201cI heard that in the land of Israel no one, permits a married woman to marry again on the evidence of one witness, except Rabbi Judah ben Bava\u201d. \u201cThat is so\u201d, I told him. He said to me, \u201cTell them in my name: \u2018You know that this country is in confusion because of marauders.  I have received a tradition from Rabban Gamaliel the Elder: that they allow a married woman to remarry on the evidence of one witness\u2019\u201d.   And when I came and recounted the conversation in the presence of Rabban Gamaliel   he rejoiced at my words and exclaimed, \u201cWe have found a match for Rabbi Judah ben Bava!\u201d As a result of this talk Rabban Gamaliel remembered that some men were once killed at Tel Arza, and that Rabban Gamaliel the Elder had allowed their wives to marry again on the evidence of one witness, and the law was established that they allow a woman to marry again on the evidence of one witness, and on the testimony of one who states that he has heard from another witness, from a slave, from a woman or from a female slave. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua say: a woman is not be allowed to remarry on the evidence of one witness. Rabbi Akiva ruled: a woman is not allowed to marry again on the evidence of a woman, on that of a slave, on that of a female slave or on that of relatives. They said to him: It once happened that a number of Levites went to Tsoar, the city of palms, and one of them became ill on the way, and they left him in an inn. When they returned they asked the female innkeeper, \u201cWhere is our friend?\u201d And she replied, \u201cHe is dead and I buried him\u201d, and they allowed his wife to remarry. Should not then a priest\u2019s wife be believed at least as much as an innkeeper!\u201d He answered them:  When she will give such evidence as the innkeeper gave she will be believed, for the innkeeper had brought out to them the dead man\u2019s staff, his bag and the Torah scroll which he had with him.","1849":"On the three days preceding the festivals of idolaters, it is forbidden to conduct business with them, to lend articles to them or borrow from them, to lend or borrow any money from them, to repay a debt, or receive repayment from them. Rabbi Judah says: we should receive repayment from them, as this can only depress them; But they the Rabbis  said to him: even though it is depressing at the time, they are glad of it subsequently.","1850":"Rabbi Ishmael says on the three preceding days and the three following days it is forbidden; But the Sages say: before their festivities it is forbidden, but after their festivities it is permitted.","1851":"These are the festivities of the idolaters:  Kalenda,  Saturnalia,   Kratesis, the anniversary of accession to the throne and birthdays and anniversaries of deaths, according to Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say: a death at which burning of articles of the dead takes place is attended by idolatry, but where there is not such burning there is no idolatry. But the day of shaving ones beard and lock of hair, or the day of landing after a sea voyage, or the day of release from prison, or if an idolater holds a banquet for his son   the prohibition only applies to that day and that particular person.","1852":"When an idolatrous festival takes place within a city it is permitted to conduct business with non-Jews outside it. If the idolatrous festival takes place outside it, business is permitted within it. Is it permitted to go there? If the road leads solely to that place, it is forbidden; But if one can go by it to any other place, it is permitted. A city in which an idolatrous festival is taking place, some of its shops being decorated and some not decorated    this was the case with Beth-Shean,  and the Sages said: in the decorated stores it is forbidden to buy but in the undecorated ones it is permitted.","1853":"The following things are forbidden to be sold to idolaters: iztroblin, bnoth-shuah with their stems, frankincense, and a white rooster. Rabbi Judah says: it is permitted to sell a white rooster to an idolater among other roosters; but if it be by itself, one should clip its spur and then sell it to him, because a defective animal is not sacrificed to an idol. As for other things, if they are not specified their sale is permitted, but if specified it is forbidden. Rabbi Meir says: also a \u201cgood-palm\u201d,  hazab and niklivas are forbidden to be sold to idolaters.","1854":"In a place where it is the custom to sell small domesticated animals to non-Jews, such sale is permitted; but where the custom is not to sell, such sale is not permitted. In no place however is it permitted to sell large animals, calves or foals, whether whole or maimed. Rabbi Judah permits in the case of a maimed one. And Ben Bateira permits in the case of a horse.","1855":"One should not sell them bears, lions or anything which may injure the public. One should not join them in building a basilica, a scaffold, a stadium, or a platform. But one may join them in building public or private bathhouses. When however he reaches the cupola in which the idol is placed he must not build.","1856":"One should not make jewelry for an idol such as necklaces, ear-rings, or finger-rings. Rabbi Eliezer says, for payment it is permitted. One should not sell to idolaters a thing which is attached to the soil, but when cut down it may be sold. R. Judah says, one may sell it on condition that it be cut down. One should not let houses to them in the land of Israel; and it is not necessary to mention fields. In Syria houses may be let to them, but not fields. Outside of the land of Israel, houses may be sold and fields let to them, these are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says: in the land of Israel, one may let to them houses but not fields; In Syria, we may sell them houses and let fields; Outside of the land of Israel, both may be sold.","1857":"Even in such a place where the letting of a house has been permitted, they did not say that this was permitted if it was for the purpose of a residence, since the idolater will bring idols into it; for it says, \u201cyou shall not bring an abomination into your house\u201d (Deut. 7:26). In no place may one let a bath-house to an idolater, as it is called by the name of the owner.","1858":"One should not place animals in inns of non-Jews,  because they are suspected of bestiality. A woman should not be alone with them, because they are suspected of licentiousness; Nor should a man be alone with them, because they are suspected of shedding blood. A Jewish woman should not act as midwife to a non-Jewish woman, because she would be delivering a child for idolatry. But a non-Jewish woman may act as midwife to a Jewish woman. A Jewish woman should not suckle the child of a non-Jewish woman, But a non-Jewish woman may suckle the child of a Jewish woman in her premises.","1859":"We may allow them to heal us when the healing relates to money, but not personal healing; Nor should we have our hair cut by them in any place, this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages said:  in a public place it is permitted, but not when the two persons are alone.","1860":"The following things belonging to non-Jews are forbidden for Jews to use and the prohibition extends to any benefit that may be derived from them: wine, or a non-Jew\u2019s vinegar that was formerly wine, Hadrianic earthenware, skins pierced at the animal\u2019s heart. Rabban Shimon Gamaliel says: when its tear is round, the skin is forbidden, but if oblong it is permitted. Meat which is being brought into a place of idol worship is permitted,  but that which is brought out is forbidden, because it is like a sacrifice to the dead,  this is the opinion of Rabbi Akiba. With non-Jews going on a pilgrimage to worship idols it is forbidden to have any business transactions, but with those returning it is permitted.","1861":"Skin-bottles or flasks of non-Jews in which wine of a Jew is kept are forbidden and the prohibition extends to any benefit that may be derived from them, this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say that the prohibition does not extend to deriving benefit. Grape seeds and grape-skins of non-Jews are forbidden, the prohibition extending to any benefit that may be derived from them, this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say, when fresh they are forbidden but when dry they are permitted. Fish brine and Bithynian cheese of the non-Jews are forbidden, the prohibition extending to any benefit that may be derived from them, this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say that the prohibition does not extend to deriving benefit.","1862":"Rabbi Judah said: Rabbi Ishmael put this question to Rabbi Joshua as they were walking on the way, \u201cWhy have they forbidden the cheese of non-Jews?\u201d He replied, because they curdle it with the rennet of a nevelah said: \u201cbut is not the rennet of a burnt-offering more strictly forbidden than the rennet of a nevelah? and yet it was said that a priest who is not fastidious may suck it out raw.\u201d said to him: \u201cif that be so, why do they not extend the prohibition to any benefit derived from it?\u201d He diverted him to another matter, saying: \u201cIshmael, how do you read   for your masc. love is more delightful than wine\u201d or \u201cyour fem. love etc. (Song of Songs 1:2\u201d He replied: \u201cyour fem. love is better \u2026\u201d He said to him: this is not so, as it is proved by its fellow -verse: your ointments masc. have a goodly fragrance \u2026 therefore do the maidens love you (Song of Songs 1:3).\u201d","1863":"The following articles of non-Jews are prohibited but the prohibition does not extend to deriving benefit from them: 1. milk which a non-Jew milked without an israelite watching him, 2. their bread and oil 3. stewed and pickled things into which they are accustomed to put wine or vinegar, 4. pickled herring which had been minced, 5. brine in which there is no kalbith-fish floating, 6. helek, 7. pieces of asa foetida 8. and sal-conditum. Behold these are prohibited but the prohibition does not extend to deriving benefit from them.","1864":"The following are permitted to be eaten by an israelite:milk which a non-Jew milked with a Jew watching him; honey, grape-clusters    even though these secrete moisture the law which renders food susceptible to defilement by a liquid does not apply to them preserves into which they are not accustomed to put wine or vinegar, pickled herring which has not been minced, brine containing fish, a leaf of asafoetida, and rolled olive-cakes. Rabbi Yose says: those olives having pits ready to drop out are prohibited. Locusts which come out of a shopkeeper\u2019s basket are prohibited, but if from storage they are permitted. The same rule applies to terumah.","1865":"All images are prohibited because they are worshipped once a year, according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir; But the Sages say: an image is not prohibited except one that has a staff or bird or orb in its hand. Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel says: any image which has anything in its hand is prohibited.","1866":"One who finds fragments of images, behold they are permitted. If one found the figure of a hand or the figure of a foot, behold it is prohibited because such an object is worshipped.","1867":"If one finds utensils upon which is the figure of the sun or moon or a dragon, he casts them into the Dead Sea. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: if one of these figures is upon precious utensils they are prohibited, but if upon common utensils they are permitted. Rabbi Yose says: he may grind an idol to powder and scatter it to the wind or throw it into the sea. They said to him, even so it may then become manure, as it says, \u201clet nothing that has been proscribed stick to your hand (Deuteronomy 13:18)\u201d.","1868":"Proclos, son of a plosphos, asked Rabban Gamaliel in Acco when the latter was bathing in the bathhouse of aphrodite. He said to him, \u201cIt is written in your torah, \u2018let nothing that has been proscribed stick to your hand    what is treated as a god is prohibited, what is not treated as a deity is permitted.","1869":"If idolaters worship mountains and hills these are permitted;  but what is upon them is prohibited, as it is says, \u201cyou shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them and take them\u201d (Deut. 7:25). Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: it says \u201ctheir gods on the mountains\u201d (Deut. 12:,  not their mountains which are their gods; \u201ctheir gods on the hills\u201d (ibid.), not their hills which are their gods. And why is an asherah prohibited?  Because there was manual labour connected with it, and whatever has manual labour connected with it is prohibited. Rabbi Akiba said: let me expound and decide the interpretation before you: wherever you find a high mountain or elevated hill or green tree, know that an idolatrous object is there.","1870":"If a Jew has a house next to an idolatrous shrine and it collapsed, he is forbidden to rebuild it. What should he do? He withdraws a distance of four cubits into his own ground and build there. If the wall belonged both to him and the shrine, it is judged as being half and half. Its stones, timber and rubbish defile like a creeping thing, as it says, \u201cyou shall utterly detest it\u201d (Deut. 7:26).   Rabbi Akiba says: it defiles like a menstruous woman, as it says, \u201cand you will treat as unclean the silver overlay of your images and the golden plating of your idols.  You will cast them away like a menstruous woman.  Out, you will call to them\u201d (Isaiah 30:22), just as a menstruous woman impurifies an object by carrying it, so also an idolatrous object defiles by its being carried.","1871":"There are three types of shrines: A shrine originally built for idolatrous worship   behold this is prohibited. If one plastered and tiled an ordinary house for idolatry and renovated it, one may remove the renovations. If he had only brought an idol into it and taken it out again, the house is permitted. There are three kinds of idolatrous stones: A stone which a man hewed originally to serve as a pedestal for an idol   behold this is prohibited. If one plastered and tiled a stone for idolatry, one may remove the plaster and tile, and it is then permitted. If he set an idol upon it and took it off, behold the stone is permitted. There are three kinds of asherah: a tree which has originally been planted for idolatry   behold this is prohibited. If he chopped and trimmed a tree for idolatry, and its sprouted  afresh, he removes the new growth. If he only set an idol under it and took it away, behold the tree is permitted. What is an asherah? Any tree beneath which there is an idol. Rabbi Shimon says: any tree which is worshipped. It happened at Sidon that there was a tree which was worshipped and they found a heap of stones beneath it. Rabbi Shimon said to them, \u201cexamine this heap.\u201d They examined it and discovered an image in it.  He said to them, \u201csince it is the image that they worship, we permit the tree for you.\u201d","1872":"One may not sit in its shadow, but if he sat he is pure. Nor may he pass beneath it, and if he passed he is impure. If it encroaches upon the public road and he passed beneath he is pure. They may sow vegetables beneath it in winter but not in summer, and lettuce neither in summer nor winter. Rabbi Jose says: even vegetables may not be planted in winter because the foliage falls upon them and becomes manure for them.","1873":"If one took pieces of wood from it the asherah tree, they are forbidden to be used. If he heated an oven with them if it was new it must be broken to pieces; if it was old, it must be allowed to cool. If he baked bread in an oven heated with wood from an asherah, it is forbidden to be used, and if the loaf became mixed with other loaves, they are all prohibited. Rabbi Eliezer says: let him cast the advantage he derives into the Dead Sea. They said to him: there is no process of redemption for an idol. If one took a piece of wood from it to use as a shuttle, it is forbidden to be used. If he wove a garment with it, it is forbidden to be used. If the garment) became mixed with others, and these with others, they are all forbidden to be used. Rabbi Eliezer says: let him cast the advantage he derives into the Dead Sea. They said to him: there is no process of redemption for an idol.","1874":"How does one annul an asherah? If a pagan pruned or trimmed it, removing from it a stick or twig or even a leaf, behold it is annulled. If he smoothed it out for its own sake, it is prohibited; but if not for its own sake, it is permitted.","1875":"Rabbi Ishmael says: if three stones are lying side by side next to a merculis, they are prohibited; if there are two they are permitted. The sages say: if the stones are seen to be connected with it they are prohibited, but if they do not appear to be connected with it they are permitted.","1876":"If he found on top of a mercurius a coins or a garment or utensils behold these are permitted; But if he found grape-clusters, wreaths of grain, gifts of wine, oil or fine flour, or anything resembling what is offered upon the altar, such is prohibited.","1877":"If an idolatrous shrine has a garden or bathhouse, one may use either so long as it is not to the advantage of the idolaters, But one may not use either if it is to its advantage. If the garden or bathhouse belonged jointly to it and to others, one may use them whether it be to the advantage of idolatry or not.","1878":"The idol of an idolater is prohibited immediately; but if it belonged to a Jew it is not prohibited until it is worshipped. An idolater can annul an idol belonging to himself or to another idolater, but a Jew cannot annul the idol of an idolater. He who annuls an idol annuls the things that pertain to it. If he only annulled the things that pertain to it these are permitted but the idol itself is prohibited.","1879":"How does he annul it? If he cut off the tip of its ear, the tip of its nose, or the tip of its finger; or if he defaced it, although there was no reduction in the mass of the material, he has annulled it. If he spat before it, urinated before it, dragged it in the dust or hurled excrement at it, behold it is not annulled. If he sold or gave it as a pledge, Rabbi says that he has annulled it, but the sages say that he has not annulled it.","1880":"An idol which its worshippers abandoned in time of peace is permitted, in time of war it is prohibited. Pedestals of kings are permitted because they set them up at the time the kings pass by.","1881":"They asked the elders in Rome, \u201cIf your God has no desire for idolatry, why does he not abolish it?\u201d They replied, \u201cIf it was something unnecessary to the world that was worshipped, he would abolish it; but people worship the sun, moon, stars and planets; should he destroy his universe on account of fools!\u201d They said to the elders, \u201cIf so, he should destroy what is unnecessary for the world and leave what is necessary for the world!\u201d They replied, \u201cIf he did that, we should merely be strengthening the hands of the worshippers of these, because they would say, \u201cknow that these are deities, for behold they have not been abolished!\u201d","1882":"A winepress containing trodden grapes may be purchased from a non-Jew even though it was he that lifted the trodden grapes with his hand and put them among the heap. And the juice does not become yen nesek until it descends into the vat. When it has descended into the vat, what is in the vat is prohibited; But the remainder is permitted.","1883":"A Jew may tread the winepress together with a non-Jew but may not pick grapes with him. If an israelite was working in a state of ritual impurity, one may neither tread nor pick with him, but one may move empty casks with him to the press and carry them filled with him from the press. If a baker was working in a state of ritual impurity, one may neither knead nor roll dough with him but we may carry loaves with him to the bakery.","1884":"If a non-Jew was found standing by the side of a vat of wine, if he had loaned money to the Jew, then the wine is prohibited; but should he not have loaned money to the Jew, then it is permitted. If a non-Jew fell into a vat and climbed out, or measured it with a reed, or flicked out a hornet with a reed, or tapped on the top of a frothing cask All of these things actually happened, and the Rabbis said that the wine may be sold, but Rabbi Shimon permits it even to be drunk. If a non-Jew took a cask, and in his anger threw it into the vat   this actually happened and the Rabbis declared it fit for drinking.","1885":"If an Jew prepares a non-Jew's wine in a state of ritual purity and leaves it in the non-Jew\u2019s domain, in a house which is open to the public domain, should it be in a city where non-Jews and Jews reside, it is permitted. But should it be in a city where only non-Jews reside it is prohibited unless an Jew sits and guard. There is no need for the guard to sit and watch the whole time; even if he keeps going out and coming in it is permitted. Rabbi Shimon ben Eleazar says: it is all one with the domain of a non-Jew.","1886":"If a Jew prepares a non-Jew\u2019s wine in a state of ritual purity and leaves it in the non-Jew\u2019s domain, and the non-Jew writes for him \u201cI have received the money from you,\u201d then the wine is permitted. If, however, the Jew wished to remove it and the non-Jew refuses to let it go until he paid him   this actually happened in Beth-Shan and the Rabbis prohibited it.","1887":"If a non-Jew hires a Jewish workman to assist him in the transportation of yen nesekh, his wage is prohibited. If he hired him to assist him in another kind of work, even if he says to him, \"remove for me a cask of yen nesekh from this place to that,\" his wage is permitted. If he hired a Jew's donkey to carry yen nesekh, its wages are prohibited; But if he hired it to sit upon, even though the non-Jew rested his jar of yen nesekh upon it, its wages are permitted.","1888":"If yen nesekh fell upon grapes, one may rinse them and they are permitted, but if they were split they are prohibited. If it fell upon figs or upon dates, should there be in them sufficient wine to impart a flavor, they are prohibited. It happened with Boethus ben Zpnin that he carried dried figs in a ship and a cask of yen nesekh was broken and it fell upon them; and he consulted the Sages who declared them permitted. This is the general rule: whatever derives advantage from yen nesekh by its imparting a flavor is prohibited, but whatever does not derive advantage from yen nesekh by its imparting a flavor is permitted, as, for example vinegar which fell upon split beans.","1889":"If a non-Jew was transporting jars of wine together with a Jew from place to place, and it was presumed that the wine was under guard, it is permitted. But if the Jew informed him that he was going away and he was absent a length of time sufficient for the other to bore a hole in a jar, stop it up and the sealing clay to become dry, the wine is prohibited. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: a length of time sufficient for him to open a cask,  put a new stopper on and the new stopper to become dry.","1890":"If a Jew left his wine in a wagon or on a ship while he went along a short cut, entered a town and bathed, it is permitted. But if the Jew informed him that he was going away and he was absent a length of time sufficient for the other to bore a hole in a jar, stop it up and the sealing clay to become dry, the wine is prohibited. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: a length of time sufficient for him to open a cask,  put a new stopper on and the new stopper to become dry. If a Jew left a non-Jew in his shop, although he kept going in and out, the wine there is permitted. But if the Jew informed him that he was going away and he was absent a length of time sufficient for the other to bore a hole in a jar, stop it up and the sealing clay to become dry, the wine is prohibited. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: a length of time sufficient for him to open a cask,  put a new stopper on and the new stopper to become dry.","1891":"If a Jew was eating with a non-Jew at a table and set some flasks upon the table and others upon a side-table and leaving them there went out, what is upon the table is prohibited and what is upon the side-table is permitted. And should he have said to him, \u201cmix some of the wine with water and drink,\u201d even what is upon the side-table is prohibited. Opened casks are prohibited, and the closed ones are permitted except when he was absent a length of time sufficient for the non-Jew to open it,  put a new stopper on and the new stopper to become dry.","1892":"If a band of non-Jewish marauders entered a city in a time of peace, the open casks are prohibited and the sealed are permitted; In a time of war both are permitted because they do not have the leisure to offer libations.","1893":"If a non-Jew sent to Jewish craftsmen a cask of yen nesekh as their wages, they are allowed to say to him, \u201cgive us its value in money\u201d; But after the wine has come into their possession the exchange is prohibited. If a Jew sells his wine to a non-Jew, should he have set the price before he measured it out, the purchase-money is permitted; But should he have measured it out before he set the price, the purchase-money is prohibited. If a Jew took a funnel and measured wine into a non-Jew\u2019s flask and then measured some into a Jew\u2019s flask, should a drop of the first wine have remained in the funnel, then the wine measured into the second flask is prohibited. If he poured from his own vessel into a non-Jew\u2019s vessel, the wine in the vessel from which he poured is permitted and the wine in the vessel into which he poured is prohibited.","1894":"Yen nesekh is prohibited and renders other wine prohibited by the smallest quantity. Wine mixed with wine and water with water prohibits by the smallest quantity. Wine mixed with water and water with wine disqualifies when the prohibited element imparts a flavor. This is the general rule: with the same type the mixture is disqualified by the smallest quantity, but with a different type it is disqualified when the prohibited element imparts a flavor.","1895":"The following are prohibited and render prohibited by the smallest quantity:a cask of yen nesekh; an idolatrous object; skins of animals which have holes over the heart; an ox which has been sentenced to be stoned; a heifer whose neck was broken; birds brought as an offering by a leper; the hair-offering of a nazirite; the first born of a donkey; meat cooked in milk; the scapegoat; and non-consecrated animals slaughtered in the Temple court. Behold these are prohibited and render prohibited by the smallest quantity.","1896":"If yen nesekh fell into a vat, the whole of it is prohibited for use. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: the whole of it may be sold to non-Jews with the exception of a quantity corresponding to the value of the yen nesekh in it.","1897":"If a non-Jew covered a stone wine press with pitch it may be scoured and is then clean; But if it was of wood, Rabbi says that it may be scoured and the Sages say that he must peel off the pitch. If it was of earthenware, even though he peeled off the pitch it is prohibited.","1898":"If a Jew purchases cooking-utensils from a non-Jew, those which are customarily used with cold liquids, he must immerse; Those which are customarily used with hot liquids, he must be dip in boiling water; Those which are customarily made white-hot in the fire, he must make white-hot in the fire. A spit and grill must be made white-hot, But a knife may be polished and is then ritually clean.","1899":"If two partners wish to make a partition in a courtyard they build the wall in the middle. In a place where the custom is to build of unshaped stones, or of hewn stones, or of half-bricks, or of whole bricks, so they should build it everything is according to local custom. If the wall is made of unshaped stones this one supplies from his property three handbreadths, and this one supplies from his property three handbreadths. If the wall is made of hewn stones this one supplies from his property two and a half handbreadths, and this one supplies from his property two and a half handbreadths. If the wall is made of half-bricks this one supplies from his property two handbreadths, and this one supplies from his property two handbreadths. If the wall is made of whole bricks this one supplies from his property one and a half handbreadths, and this one supplies from his property one and a half handbreadths.","1900":"The same is true with a garden:  in a place where the custom is to build a fence, they can obligate him to do so. However, in a valley, where it is not customary to build a fence, they cannot obligate him to do so. But if he wants to build a fence he must gather into his own portion and build, and he puts a finishing on the outside of the wall. Therefore if the wall falls, the place and the stones belong to him. If they acted with each other\u2019s consent, they should build the wall in the middle and put a finishing on both sides. Therefore if the wall falls, the place and the stones belong to them both.","1901":"If a man\u2019s land surrounded his fellow\u2019s land on three sides, and he fenced it on the first and the second and the third sides, they do not obligate him to share in the costs. Rabbi Yose says:  \u201cIf he rose and built a fence on the fourth side, they obligate him to share in all of the costs.\u201d","1902":"If the wall of a courtyard fell down they obligate each of the partners to help in building it up to a height of four cubits. He is presumed to have paid his share unless the other brings proof that he has not paid. If the fence was built four cubits or higher, they do not obligate him to help in building it. If the one who did not contribute built another wall near it, even if he did not put a roof upon it, they obligate him to share in all of the costs. He is presumed not to have paid his share unless he brings proof that he has.","1903":"They compel a partner in a courtyard to contribute to the building of a gate-house and a door for the courtyard. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  \u201cNot all courtyards are fit for a gate-house.\u201d They compel a resident of the town to contribute to the building of a wall for the town and double doors and a bolt. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  \u201cNot every town is fit for a wall.\u201d How long must a man dwell in a town to count as one of the men of the town? Twelve months. If he has purchased a dwelling place he immediately counts as one of the men of the town.","1904":"They do not divide a courtyard until there is four cubits for this partner and four cubits for this partner. Nor do they divide up a field until it has nine kavs for this partner and nine kavs for this partner. Rabbi Judah says: \u201cUntil it has nine half-kavs for this partner and nine half-kavs for this partner. Nor do they divide up a garden until it has a half-kav for this partner and a half-kav for this partner. Rabbi Akiva says:  \u201cA quarter-kav.\u201d Nor do they divide up an eating hall, a watch-tower, a dovecote, a cloak, a bathhouse, or an olive-press until there is sufficient for this partner and for this partner. This is the general rule:  whatever can be divided and still be called by the same name, they divide; otherwise they do not divide. When is this so?  When they do not both wish to divide the property. However, if both wish they can divide it even if it is smaller. And with regards to the Sacred Books, they may not be divided even if both are willing.","1905":"One may not dig a cistern near his fellow\u2019s cistern; Nor may he dig a ditch, cave, water-channel, or laundry pool unless it is three handbreadths away from his fellow\u2019s wall, and he must plaster it with lime. They distance piles of olive refuse, manure, salt, lime or stones three handbreadths from his fellow\u2019s wall, and he plasters it with lime. They distance seeds, and a plow and urine three handbreadths from the wall. And they distance the mill from the wall: three handbreadths from the lower millstone and four handbreadths from the upper millstone. And they distance the oven from the wall:  three from the belly of the oven and four from the rim of the oven.","1906":"One may not set up an oven inside a house unless there is a space of four cubits above it. If he sets it up in the upper room, the flooring beneath it must be three handbreadths deep, or for a stove one handbreadth. And if it causes damage to the floor he must pay for the damage caused. Rabbi Shimon says:  \u201cThey only mentioned these measurements so that if the object caused damage he would be exempt.\u201d","1907":"One may not open a bakery or a dyer\u2019s shop under his fellow\u2019s storehouse, nor a cattle stall. In truth, they have permitted these things under a winestore but not a cattle stall. A man may protest against another that opens a shop within the courtyard and say to him, \u201cI cannot sleep because of the noise of them that go in and out.\u201d One who makes utensils, should go outside and sell them in the market. But none may protest and say to him, \u201cI cannot sleep because of the noise of the hammer\u201d or \u201cbecause of the noise of the mill-stones\u201d or \u201cbecause of the noise of children.\u201d","1908":"If one\u2019s wall was adjacent to his friend\u2019s wall he may not build another wall adjoining it unless it is at a distance of four cubits. And if he builds a wall opposite his friend\u2019s windows, whether it is higher or lower than them or level with them, it may not be within four cubits.","1909":"A person\u2019s ladder must not be kept within four cubits of his neighbor\u2019s dovecote, lest a marten should jump in. His wall may not be built four cubits from his neighbor\u2019s roof-gutter, so that the other can set up his ladder to clean it out. A dovecote may not be kept within fifty cubits of a town, and none may build a dovecote in his own domain unless his ground extends fifty cubits in every direction. Rabbi Judah says: Four kor\u2019s space of ground, which is the length of a pigeon\u2019s flight. But if he had bought it and it was built already in that place and there was only a quarter-kab\u2019s space of ground, he has a right to the dovecote.","1910":"If a young pigeon is found within fifty cubits it belongs to the owner of the dovecote; but if it is found beyond fifty cubits it belongs to who finds it. If it is found between two dovecotes:  if it is nearer to this one than it belongs him that owns this dovecote; and if it is nearer to the other, it belongs to him that owns the other dovecote; and if it is at a like distance from either, they share it.","1911":"A tree may not be grown within a distance of twenty five cubits from the town, or fifty cubits if it is a carob tree or a sycamore tree. Abba Shaul says:  \u201cAny tree that bears no fruit may not be grown within a distance of fifty cubits.\u201d If the town was there first, the tree shall be cut down and no compensation given; if the tree was there first it shall be cut down and compensation given. If it is in doubt which was there first, the tree shall be cut down and no compensation given.","1912":"A permanent threshing floor may not be made within fifty cubits of the town. One may not make a permanent threshing floor within his own domain unless his ground extends fifty cubits in every direction. And he must distance it from his fellow's plants and ploughed land so that it will not cause damage.","1913":"Animal carcasses, graves and tanneries must be distanced fifty cubits from a town. A tannery may be set up only to the east of a town. Rabbi Akiva says:  \u201cIt may be set up on any side save the west, and it must be distanced fifty cubits from the town.","1914":"A pool for soaking flax must be distanced from vegetables, and leeks from onions, and mustard plant from bees. Rabbi Yose permits mustard plant.","1915":"A tree may not be grown within twenty five cubits of a cistern, or within fifty cubits if it is a carob or a sycamore, whether it is higher or on the same level. If the cistern was there first the tree shall be cut down and compensation given. If the tree was there first it shall not be cut down. If it is in doubt which was there first, the tree shall not be cut down. Rabbi Yose says:  \u201cEven if the cistern was there before the tree it should not be cut down, since this one dug within his own domain and the other planted within his own domain.\u201d","1916":"A person may not plant a tree near another\u2019s field unless it is four cubits away, no matter whether it be a vine or any other kind of tree. If there was a wall between, each may plant up to the wall on either side. If its roots entered within the other\u2019s property, the other may cut them away to a depth of three handbreadths so that they shall not hinder the plough. If he dug a cistern, trench or cave, he may cut them away as far down as he digs, and the wood shall belong to him.","1917":"If a tree stretches into another\u2019s field, he may cut it away as far as is reached by an ox-goad held over the plough, or, if it is a carob or sycamore, he may cut it away according to the plumb line\u2019s measure. All trees that stretch over irrigated fields may be cut away according to the plumb line\u2019s measure. Abba Shaul says:  \u201cAll trees that bear no fruit may be cut away according to the plumb line\u2019s measure.\u201d","1918":"If a tree stretches into the public domain enough must be cut away to allow a camel and its rider pass by. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cA camel laden with flax or bundles of branches.\u201d Rabbi Shimon says:  \u201cEvery tree must be cut away according to the plumb line\u2019s measure, because of impurity.","1919":"The legal period of possession in order to establish ownership for houses, cisterns, trenches, caves, dovecotes, bath-houses, olive-presses, irrigated fields and slaves and anything which continually produces a yield is three complete years. The legal period of possession in order to establish ownership for a field irrigated by rain water is three years and they need not be completed. Rabbi Yishmael says:  \u201cThree months during the first year, and three months during the last year and twelve months during the middle year, which makes eighteen months.\u201d Rabbi Akiva says:  \u201cOne month during the first year and one month during the last year and twelve months during the middle year, which makes fourteen months.\u201d Rabbi Yishmael said:  \u201cWhen does this apply?  With regards to a sown field, but with tree plantation, if he brought in his produce (grapes), collected the olives and gathered in his fig harvest, this counts as three years.\u201d","1920":"There are three regions with regards to possession:  Judea, beyond the Jordan and the Galilee. If the owner was in Judea and another took possession of his property in the Galilee; Or if he was in the Galilee and another took possession of his property in Judea, such possession does not demonstrate ownership, until he is in the same region. Rabbi Judah said:  \u201cThey have specified a period of three years so that if the owner was in Spain and another took possession of his property during one year, they could make it known to the owner during the next year and he could return in the third year.\u201d","1921":"An act of possession without which there is no claim on the ownership of the property is not valid possession to establish ownership. How is this so? If he said to him:  \u201cWhat are you doing on my property? And the other answered:  \u201cNo one ever said anything to me\u201d, this is not valid possession to establish ownership. If he said to him:  \u201cYou sold it to me\u201d, \u201cYou gave it to me as a gift\u201d, \u201cYour father sold it to me\u201d, \u201cYour father gave it to me as a gift\u201d, this is valid possession to establish ownership. He who holds possession for three years due to inheritance from the previous owner, does not need to make a claim. Craftsmen, partners, sharecroppers and guardians cannot establish ownership through possession. A man cannot establish ownership through possession of his wife\u2019s property, nor may a wife establish ownership through possession of her husband\u2019s property, nor a father of his son\u2019s property, nor a son of his father\u2019s property. When is this so that one needs three years to establish ownership? When the person attempts to acquire the land through possession. But, when the property was given as a gift, or when brothers shared a piece of their inheritance, or when one claimed title by possession to the property of a convert who died without inheritors, then if the claimant has shut in, walled up or broken down anything, this counts as securing ownership through possession.","1922":"If two testify that he has had the use of property during three years and they are found to be false witnesses, they must make full restitution to the owner. If two false witnesses testify of the first year, two of the second, and two of the third, they divide up the costs of restitution between them. If three brothers testify and another is included with them, they offer three different acts of testimony, but their words count as a single act of testimony when the evidence is proved false.","1923":"What are usages which are effective in establishing title through possession and what are usages which are not effecting in establishing title through possession? If a man put a beast in a courtyard, or an oven or stoves or mill-stones, or reared fowl in a courtyard or put his manure in a courtyard, this is not effective in establishing title through possession. But if he built for his beast a partition ten hand-breadths high, so too for an oven, so too for a stove, so too for a mill-stone, or he brought fowl inside the house, or prepared for his manure a place three hand-breadths deep or three hand-breadths high, this is effective in establishing title through possession.","1924":"A gutter spout cannot cause title through possession so that the spout may still be moved but title through possession may be claimed to its place so that the place must be left for its present purpose. A gutter can give title through possession. An Egyptian ladder cannot give title through possession but a Tyrian ladder can. An Egyptian window cannot give title through possession but a Tyrian window can. What is an Egyptian window?  Any through which a man\u2019s head may not enter. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cIf it has a frame, even though a man\u2019s head cannot enter through it, it can give title through possession.\u201d A projection, if it extends a handbreadth or more can give title through possession, and the other into whose premises it projects can protest against it. But if it is less than a handbreadth it cannot give title through possession and the other cannot protest against it.","1925":"One may not make a window to open into a jointly held courtyard. If he bought a house in another and adjoining courtyard he may not open it into a jointly held courtyard. If he built an upper room over his house he may not make it open into the jointly held courtyard; But, if he wishes, he may build another room within his house or build an upper room over his house and make it open into his own house. In a jointly held courtyard a man may not build a door directly opposite another\u2019s door, or a window directly opposite another\u2019s window. If the window was small he may not make it larger; if it was a single window he may not make it into two. But in the public domain he may open a door opposite another\u2019s door, or a window opposite another\u2019s window. If the window was small he may make it larger; if it was a single window he may make it into two.","1926":"One may not hollow out a space underneath the public domain such as cisterns, trenches or caves. Rabbi Eliezer permits it if it is such that a wagon loaded with stones can safely go over it. Projections and balconies may not be built into the public domain; but if a man wishes to build a projection or balcony he may withdraw his wall within his own domain and build out from it. If he bought a courtyard in which were already projections and balconies, his right to maintain them may not be disputed.","1927":"If a man sold a house, he has not sold its side chambers, even though they open into the house, nor the room that is behind the house, nor the roof, if it has a railing more than ten hand-breadths high. Rabbi Judah says: \u201cIf the roof as entrance shaped like a door, even if the railing is not ten hand-breadths high, it is not sold.\u201d","1928":"Nor has he sold the cistern or the cellar, even though he had written in the deed of sale, \u201cthe depth and height\u201d. And he the seller must buy himself a path from the new owner to reach the cellar or cistern, according to Rabbi Akiva. But the Sages say:  \u201cHe need not buy himself a path.\u201d And Rabbi Akiva agrees that if he had said to him, \u201cExcepting these the cistern or cellar\u201d that he need not buy himself a path. If he sold them the cellar or cistern to another, Rabbi Akiva says:  \u201cHe need not buy himself a path.\u201d But the Sages say:  \u201cHe must buy himself a path.\u201d","1929":"If a man sold a house he has sold also the door, but not the key. He has sold a permanent mortar but not a movable one. He has sold the convex millstone but not the concave one. Nor has he sold the oven or the stove. But if he had said:  \u201cI am selling to you the house and all that is in it, these are also sold.\u201d","1930":"If a man sold a courtyard, he has also sold its houses, cisterns, trenches and caves, but not the movable property. But if he had said:  \u201cIt and all that is in it\u201d all of these are also sold. But in neither case has he sold the bath-house, or the olive press that are in it. Rabbi Eliezer says:  \u201cIf a man sold a courtyard, he has sold only the air of the courtyard.","1931":"If a man sold an olive press he has sold also the vat, the grindstone, and the posts, but he has not sold the pressing-boards, the wheel or the beam. But if he had said:  \u201cIt and all that is in it\u201d, all these are sold also. Rabbi Eliezer said: \u201cIf a man sold an olive press he has sold the beam also.\u201d","1932":"If a man sold a bath house, he has not sold the planks or the benches or the curtains. But if he had said:  \u201cIt and all that is in it\u201d, all these are sold also. In neither case has he sold the water containers or the stores of wood.","1933":"If a man sold a town, he has also sold the houses, cisterns, trenches, caves, bath houses, dovecotes, olive presses, and irrigated fields, but not the movable property. But if he had said:  \u201cIt and all that is in it\u201d, even if cattle and slaves were in it, all of these are sold. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: \u201cIf a man sold a town he has also sold the town watchman.\u201d","1934":"If a man sold a field he has also sold the stones that are necessary to it, and the canes in a vineyard that are necessary to it, and its unreaped crop, and a partition of reed which covers less than a quarter-kav\u2019s space of ground, and the watchman\u2019s hut if it was fastened down with mortar, and ungrafted carob trees and young sycamores.","1935":"But one who sold a field has not sold the stones that are not necessary to it or the canes in a vineyard that are not necessary to it or the produce that is already picked from the ground. But if he had said, \u201cIt and all that is in it\u201d all of these are sold also. But in neither case has he sold any partition of reeds that covers a quarter-kav\u2019s space of ground, or the watchman\u2019s hut if it was not fastened down with mortar, or grafted carob trees or cropped sycamores, or any cistern or winepress or dovecote, whether they are lying waste or in use. And the seller must purchase from the buyer a way thereto, according to Rabbi Akiva. But the sages say:  \u201cHe need not.\u201d And Rabbi Akiva agrees that if he had said, \u201cExcepting these\u201d, he need not buy himself a way thereto. If he had sold them to another, Rabbi Akiva says:  \u201cHe that bought them need not buy himself a way thereto. But the Sages say:  \u201cHe must buy himself a way thereto.\u201d When is this so?  With regards to he that sells his field.  But if he gives it as a gift, he gives everything that is in it. If brothers who divided an inheritance came into possession of a field, they come into possession of everything that is in it. If a man secured title by possession of the property of a convert, and secured title by possession of the convert\u2019s field, he secures title to everything that is in it. If a man dedicated a field to the Temple he has dedicated everything in it. Rabbi Shimon says:  \u201cIf a man dedicated a field, he has dedicated only the grafted carob trees and cropped sycamores.\u201d","1936":"If a man sold a ship, he has also sold the mast, the sail, the anchor, and all the means of steering it. But he has not sold the slaves, the packing-bags, or the lading. But if he had said, \u201cIt and all that is in it\u201d, all these are sold also. If a man sold a wagon, he has not sold the mules, and if he sold the mules, he has not sold the wagon. If he sold the yoke, he has not sold the oxen, and if he sold the oxen, he has not sold the yoke. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cThe price tells all.  How is this so?  If one said to him, \u201cSell me your yoke for 200 zuz, it is known that no yoke costs 200 zuz.\u201d But the sages say:  \u201cThe price is not proof.\u201d","1937":"If a man sold a donkey he has not sold its trappings. Nahuma of Madi says:  \u201cHe has sold its trappings.\u201d Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cSometimes they are sold and sometimes they are not sold.  How is this so?  If the donkey was before him with its trappings on it and he said, \u2018Sell me this donkey of yours\u2019, the trappings are sold (with the donkey).

If a man bought the fruit of a dovecote from his fellow he must let go the first pair that are hatched. If he bought, the fruit of a beehive he may take three swarms and then the seller may make the rest sterile. If he bought honeycombs he must leave two honeycombs. If he bought olive trees to cut down the branches, he must leave two shoots.","1939":"If a man bought two trees in his fellow\u2019s field, he has not bought the ground in which they grow. Rabbi Meir says:  \u201cHe has bought the ground\u201d. When they grow may not trim them. What comes up from the stem belongs to him but what comes up from the roots belongs to the seller. And if they die, the ground is not his to replant new trees. If he bought three trees, he has bought the ground between them. When they grow he may trim them, And what comes up whether from the stem or from the roots belongs to him (the buyer). And if they die the ground is his.","1940":"He who has sold the head of a large animal, has not sold the feet. If he sold the feet, he has not sold the head. If he sold the lungs he has not sold the liver. If he sold the liver he has not sold the lungs. But in the case of a small animal: If he sold the head he has sold the feet. If he sold the feet he has not sold the head. If he sold the lungs he has sold the liver. If he sold the liver he has not sold the lungs.","1941":"There are four rules with regards to those who sell:If one has sold good wheat and it turns out to be bad, the buyer can retract. If he sold bad wheat and it is found to be good, the seller can retract. But if one sold bad wheat and it is found to be bad, or good wheat and it is found to be good, neither may retract. If one has sold dark wheat and it turned out to be white; Or white and it turned out to be dark; Or if he sold olive wood and it turned out to be sycamore wood; Or sycamore wood and it turned out to be olive wood; Or if he sold wine and it turned out to be vinegar; Or vinegar and it turned out to be wine; Either of them may retract.","1942":"If a man sold produce to his fellow and the buyer drew it towards him but did not measure it, the buyer has acquired the produce. If the seller had measured it but the buyer did not draw it towards him, he has not acquired the produce. If the buyer is clever he will rent the place in which the produce is located. If a man bought flax from his fellow he has not acquired it until he has moved it from one place to another. If it was still attached to the ground, and he plucked any small quantity of it, he has acquired possession.","1943":"If a man sold wine or oil to his fellow, and its value rose or fell, if the price rose or fell before the measure was filled up, it belongs to the seller, and he may refuse to sell except at the higher price. But if the price rose or fell after the measure was filled up, it belongs to the buyer and he may refuse to buy except at the lower price. If there was a middleman between them, and the jar broke, it is broken to the loss of the middleman. After emptying the measure the seller must let three more drops drip for the buyer. If he then turned the measure over and drained it off, what flows out belongs to the seller. The shopkeeper is not obligated to let three more drops drip. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cOnly on the eve of Shabbath as it becomes dark is he exempt.\u201d","1944":"If a man sent his child to a shopkeeper with a pondion in his hand and he measured him out an issar\u2019s worth of oil and gave him an issar in change and the child broke the flask and lost the issar, the shopkeeper is liable. Rabbi Judah declares him exempt, since the father sent the child for this purpose. And the Sages agree with Rabbi Judah that if the flask was in the child\u2019s hand, and the shopkeeper measured the oil into it, the shopkeeper is exempt.","1945":"The wholesaler must clean out his measures once every thirty days and the householder once every twelve months. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  \u201cThe rule is just the opposite.\u201d The shopkeeper must clean out his measures twice in the week and polish his weights once a week and clean out his scales after every weighing.","1946":"Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said:  \u201cWhen is this so (that one needs to clean out measures)?  With regards to liquid measures, but with regards to dry measures it is not necessary. And a shopkeeper must let the scales sink down a handbreadth to the buyer\u2019s advantage. If he gave him an exact measure, he must give him his overweight, a tenth for liquid measures and a twentieth for dry measures. Where the custom is to measure with small measures they should not measure with large measures and where the custom is to measure with large measures they should not measure with small measures. Where the custom is to smooth down what is in the measure they should not heap it up, and where the custom is to heap it up, they should not smooth it down.","1947":"If a man sold grain to his fellow and after it was sown it did not sprout, even if it was flax-seed he is not liable. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  \u201cIf it was garden-seeds, which are not used for food, he is liable.\u201d","1948":"If a man sold grain to his fellow, the buyer must agree to accept a quarter-kab of refuse with every seah. If he bought figs he must agree to accept ten that are eaten by worms for every one hundred. If he bought a cellar of wine, he must agree to accept ten jars gone sour in every one hundred. If he bought jars in Sharon, he must agree to accept ten which are not fully dry in one hundred.","1949":"If a man sold wine to his fellow and it turned sour he is not responsible. But if it was known to the seller that his wine would soon turn sour, this is a mistaken purchase. If he had said to him, \u201cI am selling you spiced wine\u201d, he is responsible for its remaining good until Shavuoth. If he said it is old wine, it must be from last year\u2019s. If he said it is vintage old wine, it must be from the year before last.","1950":"If a man sold his fellow a place to build him a house, so, too, if a man contracted with his fellow to build him a bridal-house for his son, or a widow\u2019s house for his daughter, he must build it four cubits by six cubits (80 inches x 120 inches), according to Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yishmael says:  \u201cThis is a cattle-shed\u201d. He who wants to build a cattle-shed, should build it four cubits by six. A small house six by eight (120 x. A large house eight by ten (160 x. An eating hall ten by ten (200 x. The height should be the sum of half its length and half its breadth. Proof of the matter is the sanctuary. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  \u201cShould all houses be according to the building of the Sanctuary?\u201d","1951":"If he had a cistern behind his fellow\u2019s house, he may go in and out only at the time when others are accustomed to go in and out. And he may not bring in his cattle and let them drink from his cistern, rather he must draw water and let them drink outside. He and the owner of the house should each make themselves a lock.","1952":"If he had a garden behind his fellow\u2019s garden, he may go in and out only at the time when others are accustomed to go in and out. And he may not bring in merchants, or enter through it into another field. The owner of the outer garden may plant seeds on the path. But, if with the other\u2019s consent, he has been given a path at the side of the other\u2019s garden he may go in and out when he wishes. And he may bring in merchants, but he may not enter through it into another field. And neither of them has the right to plant seeds on the path.","1953":"If a public path passed through a man\u2019s field and he took it and gave them another path by the side of the field, what he has given he has given and what he has taken for himself does not become his. A private path is four cubits. A public path is sixteen cubits. The king\u2019s path has no prescribed measure. The path to a grave has no prescribed measure. The halting places, according to the judges of Tzippori, should be four kab\u2019s space of ground.","1954":"If a man sold to his fellow a place in which to make a tomb, so, too, if a man was commissioned by his fellow to make a tomb, he must make the inside of the vault four cubits by six, and open within it eight niches, three on this side, three on that side, and two opposite the doorway. The niches must be four cubits long, seven handbreadths high, and six handbreadths wide. Rabbi Shimon says:  \u201cHe must make the inside of the vault four cubits by eight, and open within it thirteen niches, four on this side, four on that side, three opposite the doorway and one to the right of the doorway and one to the left. He must make a courtyard at the opening of the vault, six cubits by six, space enough for the bier and its bearers. And he may open within it two vaults, one on either side. Rabbi Shimon says:  \u201cFour, one on each of its sides.\u201d Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  \u201cAll depends on the nature of the rock.\u201d","1955":"If a man said to his fellow, \u201cI will sell you a kor\u2019s space of soil\u201d, and it contained crevices ten handbreadths deep or rocks ten handbreadths high, these are not included in the measurement. But if they were less than this they are included. If he said to him, \u201cAbout a kor\u2019s space of soil\u201d, even if it contained crevices deeper than ten handbreadths or rocks higher than ten handbreadths, they are included in the measurement.","1956":"If he said, \u201cI will sell you a kor\u2019s space of soil as measured by a rope\u201d, and he gave him less, the buyer may reduce the price; and if he gave him more, the buyer must give it back. But if he said, \u201cWhether less or more\u201d, even if he gave the buyer a quarter-kab\u2019s space less in every seah\u2019s space, or a quarter kab\u2019s space more in every seah\u2019s space, it becomes his; if the error was more than this, a reckoning must be made. What does he give him back? Its value in money; but if the seller wants, he gives him back the land. And why did they say that he could give back its value in money? To strengthen the power of the seller, for if, in a field containing a kor\u2019s space there would still have remained to him nine kab\u2019s space, or, in a garden, a half-kab\u2019s space, or according to Rabbi Akiva a quarter-kab\u2019s space, the buyer must give back to him land. And not only must he give back the quarter-kab\u2019s space, but all of the surplus.","1957":"If he said, \u201cI will sell you a piece of land as measured by the rope, whether it is less or more\u201d the condition \u201cwhether it is less or more\u201d makes void the condition \u201cas measured by the rope\u201d. And if he said, \u201cBe it less or more, as measured by the rope\u201d, the condition \u201cas measured by the rope\u201d makes void the condition \u201cbe it less or more\u201d, according to Ben Nanas. If he said, I will sell you a piece of land by its marks and its boundaries\u201d, and the difference was less than a sixth, the sale stands. If it was as much a sixth the buyer may reduce the price.","1958":"If a man said to his fellow, \u201cI will sell you half of the field\u201d, it must be divided between them into portions of equal value, and the buyer takes half of the field which the other allots to him. If he said, \u201cI will sell you the southern half\u201d, the field must be divided between them into portions of equal value, and the buyer takes the southern half. He accepts responsibility for providing the ground for the dividing wall and the large and small ditches. How large is the large ditch?  Six handbreadths. And the small ditch?  Three handbreadths.","1959":"There are those who inherit and bequeath, there are those who inherit but do not bequeath, there are those who bequeath but do not inherit and there are those who neither bequeath nor inherit.These inherit and bequeath:  a father as to his sons and sons as to their father and brothers from the same father, these inherit and bequeath. A man as to mother, and a man as to his wife, and the sons of sisters, inherit but do not bequeath. A woman as to her sons, and a wife as to her husband, and brothers of the mother, bequeath but do not inherit. And brothers from the same mother but not father neither inherit nor bequeath.","1960":"This is the order of inheritance:  \u201cIf a man dies without leaving a son, you shall transfer his property to his daughter\u201d the son precedes the daughter, and all the son\u2019s offspring precede the daughter. The daughter precedes the brothers and the daughters\u2019 offspring precede the brothers.\u2019 Brothers precede the father\u2019s brothers and the brothers\u2019 offspring precede the father\u2019s brothers. This is the general rule:  whosoever has precedence in inheritance, his offspring also has precedence. The father has precedence over all his offspring.","1961":"The daughters of Zelophehad took three portions of the inheritance was the first-born, he took a double portion.","1962":"The son and the daughter are alike concerning inheritance, save that the firstborn son takes a double portion of the father\u2019s property but he does not take a double portion of the mother\u2019s property. And the daughters receive maintenance from the father\u2019s property but not from the mother\u2019s property.","1963":"If a man says, \u201cSo and so, my firstborn son, shall not receive a double portion\u201d, or \u201cSo and so, my son, shall not inherit with his brothers\u201d, he has said nothing, for he has made a condition contrary to what is written in the Torah. If a man apportioned his property to his sons by word of mouth, and gave much to one and little to another, or made them equal to the firstborn, his words are valid. But if he had said that it should be so \u201cby inheritance\u201d, he has said nothing. If he had written down, whether at the beginning or in the middle or at the end of his will that it should be as a gift, his words are valid. If a man said, \u201cSo and so a man shall inherit from me\u201d and he has a daughter; or \u201cMy daughter shall inherit from me\u201d, and he has a son, he has said nothing, for he has made a condition contrary to what is written in the Torah. Rabbi Johanan ben Baroka says:  \u201cIf he said that so and so shall inherit from me of one that was qualified to inherit from him, his words are valid, but if of one that was not qualified to inherit from him his words do not remain valid.\u201d If a man wrote away his property to others and passed over his sons, what he has done is done, but the Sages are not comfortable with it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  \u201cIf has sons did not behave properly, it should be counted to his credit.\u201d","1964":"If a man said, \u201cThis is my son\u201d, he is believed. If he said, \u201cThis is my brother\u201d, he is not believed, yet the other may join him in his portion. If he died the property returns to its place. If he inherited property from elsewhere the other\u2019s brothers inherit it together with him. If a man died and a testament was found bound to his thigh, this counts as nothing. But if he had delivered it and through it granted title to another, whether of his heirs or of those who are not his heirs, his words are valid.","1965":"If a man writes over his property to his son, he must write, \u201cFrom today and after my death\u201d, according to Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Yose says, \u201cHe need not do so.\u201d If a man writes over his property to his son to be his after his death, the father cannot sell it since it is written over to the son, and the son cannot sell it since it is in the possession of the father. If his father sold the property, it is sold only until he dies; if the son sold the property, the buyer has no claim until the father dies. The father harvests the crops and gives them to whomever he wishes, and what he has left harvested belongs to all his heirs. If he left elder sons and younger sons, the elder sons may not take care of themselves from the estate at the expense of the younger sons, nor may the younger sons claim maintenance at the cost of the elder sons, rather they all share alike. If the elder sons married at the expense of the estate so too the younger sons may marry at the expense of the estate. If the younger sons said, \u201cWe will marry in the way you married\u201d, they do not listen to them, for what their father gave them, he has given.","1966":"If he left elder daughters and younger daughters, the elder daughters may not care for themselves at the cost of the younger daughters, nor may the younger daughters claim maintenance at the cost of the elder daughters, rather they all share alike. If the elder daughters married and took each her dowry from the common inheritance so too the younger daughters may marry and take each a dowry from the common inheritance. If the younger daughters said, \u201cWe will marry in the way you married\u201d, they do not listen to them, for what their father gave them, he has given. A greater stringency applies to daughters than to sons, since daughters can claim maintenance at the cost of the sons, but they cannot claim maintenance at the cost of the other daughters.","1967":"If a man died and left sons and daughters, and the property was great, the sons inherit and the daughters receive maintenance. But if the property was small the daughters receive maintenance and the sons go begging at people\u2019s doors. Admon says:  \u201cThe son may say, \u2018Must I suffer a loss because I am a male\u2019\u201d. Rabban Gamaliel says:  \u201cI approve of Admon\u2019s opinion.\u201d","1968":"If a man left sons and daughters and one that was of doubtful gender, if the property was great the males may push him onto the females; if the property was small the females may thrust him onto the males. If a man said, \u201cIf my wife shall bear a male he shall be given 100 zuz\u201d, and she had a male, he receives 100 zuz. If he said, \u201cIf my wife shall bear a female she shall be given 200 zuz\u201d, and she had a female, she receives 200 zuz. If he said, \u201cIf may wife shall bear a male he shall be given 100 zuz and if a female 200 zuz\u201d and she had a male and a female, the male receives 100 zuz and the female 200 zuz. If she had one of doubtful gender, he does not take. But if he said, \u201cWhatsoever my wife shall bear shall be given such an amount, he receives. If he the one of doubtful gender was the only heir, he inherits everything.","1969":"If a man left elder sons and younger sons, and the elder sons improved the property, they improve it to the common benefit. If they said, \u201cSee, what our father has left us, lo, we will work and from that we will eat\u201d, they improve it to their own benefit. So, too, if a woman improved the property, she improves it to the common benefit. If she had said, \u201cSee, what my husband left to me, lo, I will work and from that I will eat\u201d, she improves it to her own benefit.","1970":"If brothers were partners and one of them fell into a public office, it falls to the common benefit. If one of them got sick and needed healing, his healing is at his own expense. If certain of the brothers in their father\u2019s lifetime had made a present as groomsmen at their father\u2019s expense and after his death the present was restored to them, it is restored to the common benefit, for the groomsmen\u2019s gift counts as a loan and can be recovered in a court of law. But if one of the brothers in his father\u2019s lifetime sent his fellow jars of wine or jars of oil, they cannot be recovered through a court of law, since they count not as a loan but as a charitable deed.","1971":"If a man sent betrothal gifts to his father-in-law\u2019s house, and he sent there 100 maneh and he ate a betrothal meal of but one dinar, and he afterward divorced his wife they are not recoverable. But if he did not eat the betrothal meal, they are recoverable. If he sent many betrothal gifts in order for them to return with her to her his house when he marries her, they are recoverable. If he sent few betrothal gifts which were to be used in her father\u2019s house, they are not recoverable.","1972":"If a man who lies dying wrote over his property to others as a gift and kept back any land whatsoever, his gift remains valid even should he not die. If he did not keep back any land whatsoever, his gift does not remain valid if he should not die. If it was not written in the document, \u201cwho lies dying\u201d, but he said that he had written the document while he lay dying and they said that he was healthy when he wrote the document, he must bring proof that he had been dying, according to Rabbi Meir. But the sages say:  \u201cHe who makes a claim against his fellow bears the burden of proof.\u201d","1973":"If a man divided his property orally, Rabbi Eliezer says:  \u201cWhether he was healthy or at the point of death, property for which there is security can be acquired only by money, by a document or by possession; property for which there is no security can be acquired only by being drawn into the possession of the one acquiring. They said to him:  \u201cIt once happened that the mother of the sons of Rokhel was sick and said, \u2018Give my veil to my daughter\u2019, and it was worth twelve hundred maneh and she died and they fulfilled her words. He said to them:  \u201cMay their mother bury the sons of Rokhel.\u201d The Sages say:  \u201cOn a Sabbath his words remain valid, since he cannot write, but not on a weekday.\u201d Rabbi Joshua says:  \u201cIf they have stated this rule on the Sabbath, how much more so on a weekday.\u201d Similarly, others may acquire possession on behalf of a minor, but not on behalf of an adult. Rabbi Joshua says:  \u201cIf they have stated this rule with regards to a minor, how much more so does the rule apply to an adult.","1974":"If the house fell down on a man and his father, or upon a man and any from whom he inherits, and he was liable for his wife\u2019s ketubah or to a creditor:  the father\u2019s heirs say, \u201cThe son died first and the father died afterward\u201d, and the creditors say, \u201cThe father died first and the son died afterward.\u201d The School of Shammai says:  \u201cLet them split the property.\u201d The School of Hillel says:  \u201cThe property remains in its former status in the hands of those who inherit the father.\u201d","1975":"If the house fell down on a man and his wife, the husband\u2019s heirs say, \u201cThe wife died first and the husband died afterward\u201d and the wife\u2019s heirs say, \u201cThe husband died first and the wife died afterward\u201d.

Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: \u201cIf the borrower had property, in neither case can he exact payment from the guarantor.\u201d Moreover, Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel used to say:  \u201cIf a man was a guarantor for a woman\u2019s ketubah and her husband divorced her, the husband must vow to derive no further benefit from her, lest he make a conspiracy against the property of the guarantor and take his wife back again.\u201d","1984":"If a man lent his fellow money by using a document, he may recover the debt from mortgaged property. But if he had lent only before witnesses signature as evidence that he was indebted to him, the creditor may recover the debt only from unmortgaged property. If a man signed as a guarantor after the signatures of witnesses, the creditor may recover the debt only from the guarantor\u2019s unmortgaged property. Such a case came before Rabbi Yishmael and he said, \u201cHe may recover only from unmortgaged property\u201d. Ben Nanos said to him:  \u201cHe may recover the debt neither from mortgaged nor unmortgaged property.\u201d He said to him: \u201cWhy?\u201d He answered, \u201cIf a man seized a debtor by the throat in the street and his fellow found him and said \u2018Leave him alone (and I will pay), he is not liable, since not through trust in him did the creditor lend the debtor money.\u201d Rather which type of guarantor is liable?  If a man said, \u201cLend him money and I will pay thee\u201d, he is liable, for he lent him the money through his trust in the guarantor. And Rabbi Yishmael said, \u201cHe who wants to be wise let him occupy himself with cases dealing with monetary matters, for there is no greater branch of Torah than this; for they are like a welling fountain; and he who wishes to occupy himself with laws concerning monetary matters, let him serve as a pupil of Shimon ben Nanos.","1985":"There are four primary causes of injury:  the ox and the pit and the crop-destroying beast and fire. The distinctive feature of the ox is not like that of the crop-destroying beast, nor is the distinctive feature of either of these, which are alive, like that of fire, which is not alive; nor is the distinctive feature of any of these, whose way it is to go forth and do injury, like that of the pit, whose way it is not to go forth and do injury. What they have in common is that it is their way to do injury and that you are responsible for caring over them; and if one of them did injury whoever is responsible for the injury must make restitution to the damaged party with the best of his land.","1986":"Anything that I am responsible to guard, I have rendered it possible to do injury for which I will become obligated. If I have partially rendered it possible to do injury, I must make restitution for that injury as if I totally rendered it possible to do injury. When one damages property that fits all of the following categories: property that does not have \u201csacrilege\u201d i.e. sacrificial animals or property that belongs to the Temple in Jerusalem, property that belongs to other members of the covenant Jews, property that is owned, and the injury is done in any place other than the private domain of the injurer and the common domain of the injured and injurer, in these cases the injurer must make restitution for the injury with the best of his land.","1987":"Assessment of injury in money or things worth money must be made before a court of law and by witnesses that are free and Children of the Covenant (Jews). Women may be parties in suits concerning injury. The injured and the injurer in certain cases may share in the compensation.","1988":"Five agents of damage rank as harmless and five as an attested danger. Cattle are not an attested danger to butt, push, bite, lie down, or kick. The tooth of an animal is an attested danger to eat that which is for it; The leg of  an animal is an attested danger to break things as it walks along; So also is a warned ox an ox that has gored before; And an ox that damages in the domain of the damaged party, and human beings. The wolf, the lion, the bear, the leopard, the panther and the snake all rank as attested danger.  Rabbi Eliezer says:  When they are tame they are not attested danger, but the snake is always an attested danger. What is the difference between that which is  harmless and that which is an attested danger?  The harmless pays half-damages from its own body and the attested danger pays full damages from the best property (of its owner and guardian).","1989":"How is the leg of a beast an attested danger to break what it tramples upon as it walks along? A beast is an attested danger only in so far as it goes along in its usual way and breaks an object. If it kicked, or if small stones were tossed out from beneath its feet and it thus broke other vessels, one pays half damages. If it trampled upon a vessel and broke it, and this broken vessel fell upon another vessel and broke it, for the first one pays full damages and for the other half damages. Fowls are an attested danger in so far as they go along in their usual way and break objects. But if the fowl had its feet entangled, or if it was jumping and it thereby broke any vessel one pays half damages.","1990":"How is the tooth of a beast an attested danger to eat that which it is fit to consume? A beast is an attested danger to eat fruit and vegetables. If however it ate clothing or utensils the owner pays only half damages. When does this apply? This applies in the domain of the damaged party But if it was within the public domain, the owner is not liable. If the beast benefited, the owner pays what it benefited. How does the owner pay what the animal benefited? If it ate from the middle of the marketplace, the owner pays what the animal benefited. If it ate from the sides of the marketplace, the owner pays for the damage the animal did. If it ate from in front of the store the owner pays for what the animal benefited. If it ate from inside the store the owner pays for the damage the animal did.","1991":"If a dog or a goat jumped from a roof and broke vessels, the owner must pay full damages, since they are attested dangers. A dog that took a cake while there was a cinder attached and went to a stack of grain and ate the cake and burned the stack of grain, For the cake the owner pays full damages And for the stack of grain the owner pays half damages.","1992":"Which kind of animal is accounted harmless and which is an attested danger (muad)? An attested danger is one that people have given testimony about that it damaged for three days. A harmless one is one that has refrained from damage for three days. This is according to Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir says, An attested danger is one that people have given testimony about three times. A harmless one is one that children can touch and it will not gore.","1993":"\u201cAn ox which causes damage in the private domain of him that is injured\u201d how is this so? If it gored, pushed, bit, lay down, or kicked in the public domain its owner pays only half damages. But if in the private domain of him that is injured, Rabbi Tarfon says, \u201cHe pays full damages.\u201d The Sages says, \u201cHalf damages.\u201d Rabbi Tarfon said to them: \u201cNow, in a case in which the law dealt leniently with regards to damages caused by the foot and tooth in the public domain, in which case he is exempt, and stringently in the private domain of him that is injured to pay full damages, then since they have dealt stringently with damage caused by the horn in the public domain, ought we not deal more stringently with damage cause by the horn in the private domain of him that was injured, so that full damages be imposed.\u201d They said to him:  \u201cIt is enough if the inferred law is as strict as that from which it is inferred:  if for damages caused by the horn in the public domain half damages are imposed, so also for like damages in the private domain of him that was injured, half damages are imposed. He said to them:  \u201cI shall not derive the law in one case of damage caused by the horn from the law in another case of damage caused by the horn.  Rather I will derive the law of damage caused by the horn from the law of damage caused by the foot.  Now in a case in which the law dealt leniently with regards to damages caused by the foot or tooth in the public domain, they have dealt strictly with damage caused by the horn, ought we not deal more stringently with damage cause by the horn in the private domain. They said to him:  \u201cIt is enough if the inferred law is as strict as that from which it is inferred:  if for damages caused by the horn in the public domain half damages are imposed, so also for like damages in the private domain of him that was injured, half damages are imposed.","1994":"Human beings are always an attested danger, whether the damage is caused inadvertently or deliberately, whether the person who caused the damage is awake or asleep. If a man blinded his fellow\u2019s eye or broke his utensils he must pay full damages.","1995":"If a man left a jug in the public domain and another came and stumbled over it and broke it, he is exempt. And if he was injured by it, the owner of the jug is liable for his injury. If a man\u2019s jug broke in the public domain, and another slipped on the water, or was hurt by the potsherds, he is liable. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cIf he broke the jug with intention, he is liable, But if he broke it without intention he is not liable.\u201d","1996":"1. If a man poured out water in the public domain, and another was injured thereby, he is liable for his injury. 2. If a man hid thorns or glass in the public domain or made his fence out of thorns, or if his fence fell into the public domain and others were thereby injured, he is obligated for their injury.","1997":"If a man put out his chopped straw and stubble into the public domain to make them into fertilizer, and another was injured thereby, he is liable for his injury, and whoever comes first may take possession of them. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  \u201cWhoever leaves things that are disruptive in the public domain, and these cause damage, must make restitution, and whoever comes first may take possession of them. If a man turned over a piece of cattle dung in the public domain and another was injured thereby, he is liable for injury.","1998":"Two pot-sellers were walking one behind the other and the first stumbled and fell, and the second fell on the first, the first one is liable for the injury caused to the second.","1999":"This one comes carrying his jar and another one comes carrying his beam: this one\u2019s jar is broken by that one\u2019s beam, The owner of the beam is exempt, since this one has the right to walk along and this one has the right to walk along. If the owner of the beam came first and the owner of the jar came after, and the jar was broken by the beam,  the owner of the beam is exempt. If the owner of the beam stopped walking suddenly, he is liable. If the owner of the beam had said \u201cStop\u201d to the owner of the jar, he is exempt. If the owner of the jar came first and owner of the beam came after, and the jar was broken by the beam, the owner of the beam is liable. If the owner of the jar stopped walking suddenly,he is exempt. If the owner of the jar had said} \u201cStop\u201d to the owner of the beam, he is liable.","2000":"If two were walking along in the public domain, the one running and the other walking, or both running and they injured one another, neither is liable.","2001":"If a man was splitting wood in the private domain and injured anyone in the public domain, or if he was in the public domain and injured anyone in the private domain, or if he was in a private domain and injured anyone in another private domain, he is liable.","2002":"If two oxen which were accounted harmless hurt one another, the owner pays half-damages for that one which suffered the greater hurt. If both were attested dangers full damages are payable for that one which suffered the greater hurt. If one was accounted harmless and the other was an attested danger, that which was an attested danger as against that which was accounted harmless must pay full damages for the greater hurt that the other has suffered, while that which was accounted harmless, as against that which was an attested danger, pays only half damages for the greater hurt that the other has suffered. So, too, if two men hurt one another, full damages are payable for that one which suffered the greater hurt. If a man and an ox which was accounted harmless hurt one another, the man as against the ox accounted harmless must pay full damages for the greater hurt that the other has suffered, while the ox accounted harmless, as against the man, pays only half damages for the greater hurt that the other suffered. Rabbi Akiva says:  \u201cEven if an ox accounted harmless hurt a man, full damages must be paid for that one which suffered the greater hurt.","2003":"If an ox worth 100 gored an ox worth 200, and the carcass is not worth anything, the owner of the gored ox takes the live ox. If an ox worth 200 gored an ox worth 200 and the carcass is not worth anything, Rabbi Meir said, \u201cIf thus it was written, \u2018they shall sell the live ox and divide its price, they shall also divide the dead animal\u2019. Rabbi Judah said to him:  \u201cSuch indeed is the halachah, but you have fulfilled the verse \u2018they shall sell the live ox and divide its price\u2019, and you have not fulfilled the verse \u2018they shall also divide the dead animal\u2019. What case is this?  If an ox worth 200 gored an ox worth 200 and the corpse is worth 50, this one takes half of the live ox and half of the dead ox, and this one takes half of the live ox and half of the dead ox.","2004":"There is one who is obligated for the act of his ox and exempt from his own act, and one who is exempt from the act of his ox and obligated on his own act. If his ox caused embarrassment to another person, he is exempt; If, however he caused embarrassment to another person he is obligated. If his ox put out the eye of his slave or knocked out his slave\u2019s tooth, he is exempt from freeing the slave; If, however he put out the eye of his slave or knocked out his tooth, he is obligated to free the slave. If his ox injured his father or mother he is obligated; If, however he injured his father or mother he is exempt. If his ox lit a heap of produce on fire on Shabbat, he is obligated; If, however he lit a heap of produce on Shabbat he is exempt, because he is liable for his life.","2005":"If an ox was pursuing another ox and the latter ox was injured: this one claims \u201cYour ox caused the injury, and this one claims \u201cNo, it was injured by a rock.\u201d on the one who wishes to exact compensation lies the burden of proof. If two oxen were pursuing a third ox: this one claims \u201cYour ox caused the injury\u201d, and this one claims \u201cYour ox caused the injury\u201d, they are both exempt. However, if they were both owned by one man, they are both obligated. If one was big and was small: the owner of injured ox says that \u201cThe large one caused the injury\u201d, and the owner of the injuring ox says, \u201cThe small one caused the injury\u201d, or if one was a harmless ox and one was an attested danger the owner of the injured ox says, \u201cThe ox which is an attested danger caused the injury, and the owner of the injuring ox says, \u201cThe ox which is harmless caused the injury\u201d, on the one who wishes to exact compensation lies the burden of proof. If two oxen were injured, one big and one small, and two oxen caused the injury, one big and one small: the owner of the injured oxen says, \u201cThe big ox injured the big ox and small ox injured the small ox,\u201d and the owner of the injuring oxen says, \u201cThe small ox injured the big ox and the big ox injured the small ox\u201d; or if one was harmless and one was an attested danger: the owner of the injured oxen says, \u201cThe ox which is an attested danger injured the big ox, and the harmless ox injured the small ox\u201d, the owner of injuring oxen says, \u201cNo rather the harmless ox injured the large ox and the ox which is an attested danger injured the small ox\u201d, on the one who wishes to exact compensation lies the burden of proof.","2006":"If an ox has gored four or five other oxen, this one after this one: the owner shall pay to the owner of the last ox injured. If money remains, it will go to the the owner of the previously injured ox. If money still remains, it will go to the the owner of the ox injured previous to the previously injured ox. The owner of the last injured ox benefits, according to Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says, \u201cIf an ox worth 200 gores an ox worth 200 and the carcass is not worth anything, this one gets 100 and this one gets 100. If it injures another ox worth 200, the owner of the ox last injured receives 100 and the owner of the previously injured ox receives 50. If it injures another ox worth 200, the owner of the ox last injured receives 100, the owner of the previously injured ox receives 50, and the first two receive 25.","2007":"An ox which is an attested danger for injuring its own kind, and is not an attested danger for injuring that which is not its own kind; or an attested danger for injuring human beings and not an attested danger for injuring beasts; or an attested danger for injuring children and not an attested danger for injuring adults that for which it is an attested danger its owner pays full damages, and that for which it is not an attested danger its owner pays half damages. They said in front of Rabbi Judah: \u201cWhat if it is an attested danger on the Sabbath, and it is not an attested danger during the week?\u201d He said to them:  \u201cFor injuries done on Sabbaths its owner pays full damages and for injuries done during the week its owner pays half damages.\u201d When will this ox be considered harmless? After it refrains from doing injury for three Sabbath days.","2008":"An ox of an Israelite that gored an ox belonging to the Temple, or an ox belonging to the Temple that gored an ox of an Israelite, the owner is exempt, as it says, \u201cThe ox belonging to his neighbor\u201d (Exodus 21:35), and not an ox belonging to the Temple. An ox of an Israelite that gores an ox of a gentile, the owner is exempt. And an ox of a gentile that gores the ox of an Israelite, whether the ox is harmless or an attested danger, its owner pays full damages.","2009":"If an ox of a person of sound senses gored the ox of a deaf-mute, an insane person, or a minor, its owner is obligated. If an ox of a deaf-mute, an insane person or a minor, gored the ox of a person of sound senses, its owner is exempt. If an ox a deaf-mute, an insane person or a minor gored, the court appoints a guardian over them, and their oxen are testified against in the presence of the guardian. If the deaf-mute became of sound senses, or the insane person recovered his reason, or the minor came of age, the ox is thereupon deemed harmless once more, according to Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says, \u201cIt remains as it was before.\u201d An ox from the stadium is not liable to be put to death, as it says, \u201cWhen it will gore\u201d (Exodus 21:28), and not \u201cWhen others cause it to gore.\u201d","2010":"If an ox gored a person and he died, if it was an attested danger its owner must pay the ransom, if it was accounted harmless he is exempt from paying the ransom. In both cases the ox is obligated for the death penalty. So too if it killed a son or a daughter. If it gored a male slave or a female slave its owner pays 30 sela, Whether the slave was worth a maneh or not even worth a dinar.","2011":"If an ox was rubbing itself against a wall and it fell on a person; or if it intended to kill an animal and it killed a man; or if it intended to kill a gentile and it killed an Israelite; or if it intended to kill an untimely birth and it killed a viable infant, it is exempt from death by stoning.","2012":"The ox of a woman, or the ox of orphans, or the ox of a guardian, or a wild ox, or an ox belonging to the Temple, or an ox belonging to a proselyte who died and has no inheritors, these are all liable for the death penalty.

If its owner had tied it with a halter, or locked it up properly, but it came out and caused damage, the owner is liable, whether it was an attested danger or accounted harmless, these are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cIf it was accounted harmless he is liable, but if it was an attested danger he is exempt, as it says, \u201cand its owner did not guard it\u201d, but this one has been guarded.

And also if a cow gored an ox and its newly born young was found at its side, and it is not known if the cow gave birth before she gored, or if after she gored before she gave birth, the owner pays half damages from the value of the cow and one quarter damages from value the newborn.","2016":"If a potter brought his pots into the courtyard of a householder without permission, and the householder\u2019s cattle broke them, the householder is not liable. And if the cattle were injured by them the owner of the pots is liable. But if he brought them in by permission the owner of the courtyard is liable. If a man brought his produce into the courtyard of a householder without permission, and the householder\u2019s cattle ate it, the householder is not liable. And if the cattle were injured by it the owner of the produce is liable. But if he brought it in by permission the owner of the courtyard is liable.","2017":"If a man brought his ox into the courtyard of a householder without permission and the householder\u2019s ox gored it or the householder\u2019s dog bit it, the householder is not liable.

If the householder\u2019s father or son was in the cistern and it killed them the ox\u2019s owner must pay the ransom price. But if he had brought his ox in by permission the owner of the courtyard is liable. Rabbi says:  \u201cIn no case is the householder liable unless he had agreed to watch over it.","2018":"If an ox intended to gore another ox and struck a woman and her offspring came forth as a miscarriage, its owner is not liable for the value of the offspring. But if a man intended to strike his fellow and struck a woman and her offspring came forth as a miscarriage, he must pay the value of the offspring. How does he pay the value of the offspring? They assess the value of the woman before she gave birth and the value after she gave birth. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said:  \u201cIf so, once a woman gives birth she is more valuable. Rather, they assess how much the offspring would be worth, and he pays it to the husband, or if she has no husband to his heirs.\u201d If she was a freed bondwoman or a proselyte no penalty is incurred.","2019":"If a man dug a pit in a private domain and opened it into the public domain, or if he dug it in the public domain and opened it into a private domain, or if he dug it in a private domain and opened it into another private domain, he is liable if any is injured by the pit. If he dug a pit in the public domain and an ox or ass fell into and died, he is liable. No matter whether he digs a pit, trench, or cavern, or ditches or channels he is liable. If so, why does it say \u201ca pit\u201d (Exodus 21:33)? Just as a pit which is deep enough to cause death is ten handbreadths deep, so anything is deep enough to cause death if it is ten handbreadths deep. If they were less than ten handbreadths deep and an ox or an ass fell in and died, the owner is not liable; but if it was damaged he is liable.","2020":"If a pit belonged to two partners and one went over it and did not cover it, and the other also went over it and did not cover it, the second one is liable. If the first covered it and the second came and found it uncovered and did not cover it, the second one is liable. If he covered it properly and an ox or an ass fell into it and died, he is not liable. If he did not cover it properly and an ox or an ass fell into it and died, he is liable. If it fell forward not into the pit, frightened because of the sound of the digging, the owner of the pit is liable. But if backward not into the pit, frightened because of the sound of the digging, he is not liable. If an ox and all of its trappings fell into it and they broke, or if an ass fell into it with its trappings and they were torn, he is liable for the beast but exempt for the trappings. If an ox that was deaf, insane or young fell in, the owner is liable. If a boy or a girl or a slave or a bondwoman fell in, he is not liable.","2021":"An ox and all other beasts are alike under the laws concerning falling into a pit, keeping apart from Mount Sinai, two-fold restitution, the restoring of lost property, unloading, muzzling, diverse kinds, and the Sabbath. So to wild animals and birds. If so, why is it written \u201can ox or an ass\u201d? But Scripture spoke of prevailing conditions.","2022":"If a man brought his flock into a pen and shut it in properly and it went out and caused damage, he is exempt. If he had not shut it in properly and it went out and caused damage, he is liable. If the pen was broken through at night, or bandits broke through it, and the flock came out and caused damage, he is not liable. If the bandits brought out the flock, the bandits are liable. \uf0b7 Section one teaches that if a person were to properly enclose his flock and nevertheless the flock were to escape, the person is exempt.  Since he fulfilled his responsibility he is not liable for damages.  However, if he didn\u2019t enclose the flock properly he will be liable. \uf0b7 Section two can be explained as an exception to the rule in section one that if he didn\u2019t enclose the flock properly he is liable.  Section two teaches that if the flock broke out at night or bandits broke the fence, the owner is exempt, even though he did not properly lock the fence.  The owner is not liable since the animals broke out against his control, even though they could have gone out through the main gate, thereby making him liable.  If, on the other hand, they were to have broken the fence during the day, and he didn\u2019t lock it properly, he is liable.  (There are other explanations to this section).  The final clause of the mishnah says that if the bandits physically let out the flock, they are liable if it causes damage.","2023":"If he left the flock in the sun, or he delivered it to the care of a deaf-mute, an idiot or a minor, and it came out and caused damage, he is liable. If he delivered it to a shepherd, the shepherd takes the place of the owner. If the flock fell into a garden and derived any benefit, he pays for the benefit. If the flock went down into the garden in its usual way and caused damage, he must pay for the damage it caused. How does he pay for the damage it caused? They assess what a seah\u2019s space of ground in that field was worth before and what it is worth now. Rabbi Shimon says:  \u201cIf they consumed fully grown produce he must repay with fully grown produce; if they destroyed on seah he must repay one seah, if two seah, two seahs.","2024":"If a man stacked his sheaves in his fellow\u2019s field without his permission, and the owner of the field\u2019s beast ate the sheaves, he is exempt. If the beast was injured by them, the owner of the stack is liable. If he made the stack with his permission, the owner of the field is liable.","2025":"If a person sends forth fire in the hands of a deaf-mute, an idiot or a minor he is not liable by the laws of man, but he is liable by the laws of Heaven. If he sent it forth in the hands of a person of sound senses, the one of sound senses is liable. If one brought the fire, and then another brought the wood, he that brought the wood is liable. If one brought the wood and then another brought fire, he that brought the fire is liable. If another came and fanned the flames, the one who fanned the flame is liable. If the wind fanned the flame, they are all exempt. If a man sent forth fire, and it consumed wood or stones or dust, he is liable, for it says:  \u201cWhen a fire breaks out and spreads to thorns so that the stacked corn is consumed, or the standing corn, or the field, he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.\u201d If it passed over a fence four cubits high, or over a public way, or over a river, he is exempt. If a man kindled fire within his own domain, how far may it spread and he will still be liable? Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah says:  \u201cIt is looked at as if it was in the middle of a kor\u2019s space.\u201d  Rabbi Eliezer says:  \u201cSixteen cubits in every direction like a public highway.\u201d Rabbi Akiva says:  \u201cFifty cubits.\u201d Rabbi Shimon says:  \u201cIt is said \u2018He that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution\u2019, all is in accordance with the nature of the fire.\u201d","2026":"If a man set fire to a stack and in it there were utensils and these caught fire: Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cHe must make restitution for what was therein.\u201d But the Sages say:  \u201cHe need only pay for a stack of wheat or barley.\u201d If a kid was fastened to it to the stack and a slave stood near by, and they were burnt with it, he is liable. If there was a slave fastened to it to the stack and a kid stood near by and they were burnt with it, he is not liable. The Sages agree with Rabbi Judah that if a man set fire to a large building, he must make restitution for everything therein; for such is the custom among men to leave their goods in their houses.","2027":"If a spark flew out from under the hammer and caused damage, he is liable. If a camel laden with flax passed by in the public domain and its load of flax entered into a shop and caught fire, the owner of the camel is liable. But if the shopkeeper left his light outside, the shopkeeper is liable. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cIf it was a Hannukah light, he is not liable.\u201d","2028":"More encompassing in use is the rule of twofold restitution than the rule of fourfold or fivefold restitution; For the rule of twofold restitution applies both to what has life and what does not have life, while the rule of fourfold and fivefold restitution applies only to an ox or a sheep, for it is written,  \u201cIf a man shall steal an ox or a sheep and kill it, or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep\u201d (Ex. 21:37). One who steals from a thief does not pay twofold restitution; And the one who slaughters or sells what is already stolen does not make fourfold or fivefold restitution.","2029":"If a man stole an ox or a sheep according to the evidence of two witnesses and killed it or sold it according to the evidence of two others, he must make fourfold or fivefold restitution. If a man stole an ox or a sheep and sold it on the Sabbath, or stole it and sold it for idolatrous use or stole it and slaughtered it on the Day of Atonement; if he stole what was his father\u2019s and slaughtered it or sold it, and afterward his father died; if he stole it and slaughtered it and then he dedicated it to the Temple he must make fourfold or fivefold restitution. If he stole it and then killed it for use in healing, or for food for dogs; or if he slaughtered it and it was found to be terefah, or if he slaughtered it in the Temple Court intending to eat it as common food, he must make fourfold or fivefold restitution. In these last two cases Rabbi Shimon exempts.","2030":"If a man stole an ox or a sheep according to the evidence of two witnesses, and killed or sold it according to their evidence, and they are found to be false witnesses, they must pay the whole penalty. If he stole it according to the evidence of two witnesses, and killed it or sold it according to the evidence of two others, and both pairs are found to be false witnesses, the first pay twofold restitution and the last pay threefold restitution. If the second only were found to be false witnesses, the thief must make twofold restitution and they threefold restitution. If one of the second set of witnesses was found to be a false witness, the evidence of the other is void. If one of the first set of witnesses was found to be a false witness, the entire evidence is void, since if there is no evidence for stealing there is no evidence for slaughtering or selling.","2031":"If he stole an ox or a sheep according to the evidence of two witnesses, and slaughtered it or sold it according to the evidence of one witness or according to his own evidence, he makes twofold restitution, but not fourfold or fivefold restitution. If he stole an ox or a sheep and slaughtered it on the Sabbath, or stole it and slaughtered it for idolatrous use, or stole what was his father\u2019s and his father died, and he afterward slaughtered or sold it, or if he stole it and then dedicated it, and afterward slaughtered it or sold it, he makes twofold restitution but not fourfold or fivefold restitution. Rabbi Shimon says:  \u201cIf they were Holy Things which must be replaced if damaged or lost he must make fourfold or fivefold restitution; but if they were Holy Things which need not be replaced, he is exempt.\u201d 1. If a man stole an ox or a sheep and sold it on the Sabbath, 2. or stole it and sold it for idolatrous use 3. or stole it and slaughtered it on the Day of Atonement; 4. if he stole what was his father\u2019s and slaughtered it or sold it, and afterward his father died; 5. if he stole it and slaughtered it and then he dedicated it to the Temple 6. he must make fourfold or fivefold restitution. 1. If he stole an ox or a sheep and slaughtered it on the Sabbath, 2. or stole it and slaughtered it for idolatrous use, 4. or stole what was his father\u2019s and his father died, and he afterward slaughtered or sold it, 5. or if he stole it and then dedicated it, and afterward slaughtered it or sold it, 6. he makes twofold restitution but not fourfold or fivefold restitution. In the cases mentioned in mishnah two the person is liable for fourfold and fivefold restitution and in mishnah four he is not.  Using the line by line comparison we should be able to see why the law is different in each individual case. In case 1, if the person slaughtered the ox or sheep on the Sabbath he is obligated for the death penalty.  Since one can only receive one punishment per crime, he is not fined additionally for having slaughtered the animal.  If, however, he had only sold the animal, he would not be obligated for the death penalty and therefore he would owe the fine.  The same is true for case 3. Selling an animal for idolatrous use is not a crime for which one would receive the death penalty, and therefore he is obligated for the fine.  On the other hand, slaughtering for idolatrous use is a capital crime and therefore he receives a death penaly and not a fine.  We learn in case 4 that if he stole his father\u2019s animal and did not slaughter or sell it until after he dies he is not obligated for fourfold or fivefold restitution.  Since at the time of the slaughtering or selling part of the animal was his as an inheritance he is not obligated.  (We will see a similar law in the next mishnah).  If, however, he had sold or slaughtered the animal before the death of his father, he would be obligated.  Similarly in case 5 if he sold and slaughtered the animal after having dedicated it, he is selling or slaughtering an animal that is no longer really belongs to him. He is therefore not obligated for the fine. If, however, he slaughtered or sold the animal and then dedicated it, he will be obligated for the fine. Rabbi Shimon makes a clarification on this last law.  The \u201cHoly Things\u201d to which he refers are animals dedicated to the Temple.  There are two types of such dedications.  If the owner says that \u201cthis animal is dedicated\u201d, then he must bring this animal. If the animal gets lost or dies the owner is not obligated to bring another animal in its place.  In such a case, if a thief should steal and slaughter or sell the animal he is not obligated for fourfold or fivefold restitution.  If, however, the owner dedicated the animal by saying \u201cI dedicate an animal\u201d, then he if the original animal is lost he must bring another.  In such a case if the thief should slaughter or sell the animal he will be obligated for fourfold or fivefold restitution.  (This last law is difficult and is explained in other ways as well).","2032":"If he sold it all but a hundredth part, or if he had already a share in it, or if slaughtered it and it became unfit to eat by his own hand, or if he pierced the windpipe or rooted out its gullet, he makes twofold restitution but not fourfold or fivefold restitution. If he stole it in the owner\u2019s domain, but slaughtered it or sold it outside the owner\u2019s domain, or if he stole it outside the owner\u2019s domain and slaughtered or sold it within the owner\u2019s domain; or if he stole it and slaughtered or sold it within the owner\u2019s domain; or if he stole it and slaughtered or sold it outside the owner\u2019s domain, he must make fourfold or fivefold restitution. But if he stole it and slaughtered or sold it within the owner\u2019s domain, he is exempt.","2033":"If while he was dragging a sheep or ox out it died in the owner\u2019s domain, he is exempt. But if he had lifted it or taken it out of the owner\u2019s domain and it died, he is liable. If he brought it as the firstborn offering for his son, or gave it to his creditor, or to an unpaid guardian, or to a borrower, or to a paid guardian, or to a hirer, and one of them was dragging it away and it died in the owner\u2019s domain, he is exempt. If one of them had lifted it up or taken it outside the owner\u2019s domain, he is liable.","2034":"It is forbidden to rear small herd animals in the Land of Israel, but it is permitted to rear them in Syria or in the wildernesses of the Land of Israel. It is forbidden to rear fowls in Jerusalem because of the \u201cHoly Things\u201d, nor may priests rear them anywhere in the Land of Israel because of the laws concerning clean foods. It is forbidden to rear pigs anywhere. One should not rear a dog unless it is tied with a chain. It is forbidden to set snares for pigeons unless it be thirty ris from an inhabited place.","2035":"He who wounds his fellow is liable to compensate him on five counts:  for injury, for pain, for healing, for loss of income and for indignity. \u2018For injury\u2019:  How so? If he blinded his fellow\u2019s eye, cut off his hand or broke his foot, his fellow is looked upon as if he was a slave to be sold in the market and they assess how much he was worth and how much he is worth. \u2018For pain\u2019? If he burned him with a spit or a nail, even though it was on his fingernail, a place where it leaves no wound, they estimate how much money such a man would be willing to take to suffer so. \u2018Healing\u2019? If he struck him he is liable to pay the cost of his healing. If sores arise on him on account of the blow, he is liable for the cost of their healing.  If not on account of the blow, he is not liable. If the wound healed and then opened and healed and then opened, he is liable for the cost of the healing. If it healed completely, he is no longer liable to pay the cost of the healing. \u2018Loss of income\u2019: He is looked upon as a watchman of a cucumber field, since he already gave him compensation for the loss of his hand or foot. \u2018Indignity\u2019: All is according to the status of the one that inflicts indignity and the status of the one that suffers indignity. If a man inflicted indignity on a naked man, or a blind man, or a sleeping man, he is still liable. If a sleeping man inflicted indignity, he is exempt. If a man fell from the roof and caused injury and inflicted indignity, he is liable for the injury but not for the indignity, as it says, \u201cAnd she puts forth her hand and grabs him by the private parts\u201d, a man is liable only when he intended to inflict indignity.","2036":"The law is more strict in the case of a man than in the case of an ox:  for a man must pay for injury, pain, medical costs, loss of income and indignity, and make restitution for the value of the young; whereas the ox pays only for injury and is not liable for the value of the young.","2037":"If a man struck his father or his mother and inflicted no wound, or if he wounded his fellow on Yom Kippur, he is liable for all five counts. If he wounded a Hebrew slave, he is liable on all five counts, except loss of income if it was his slave. If he wounded a Canaanite slave he is liable on all five counts. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cSlaves do not receive compensation for indignity.\u201d","2038":"It is losing proposition to meet up with a deaf-mute, an idiot or a minor: he that injures them is obligated; and they that injure others are exempt. It is a losing proposition to meet up with a slave or married woman; he that injures them is obligated; and they that injure others are exempt. However, they pay after some time; if the woman was divorced or the slave freed they are liable for restitution.","2039":"If a man struck his father or mother and left a wound, or if he wounded his fellow on the Sabbath, he is not liable for any of the five counts because he is liable for his life. If a man wounded his Canaanite slave he is not liable on any of the five counts.","2040":"If a man boxed the ear of his fellow, he must pay him a sela (four. Rabbi Judah says in the name of Rabbi Yose the Galilean:  \u201cA maneh (one hundred.\u201d If he slapped him he must pay 200 zuz. If with the back of his hand, he must pay him 400 zuz. If he tore at his ear, plucked out his hair, spat at him and his spit touched him, or pulled his cloak from off him, or loosed a woman\u2019s hair in the street, he must pay 400 zuz. This is the general rule:  all is in accordance with the person\u2019s honor. Rabbi Akiva said:  \u201cEven the poor in Israel are regarded as free people who have lost their possessions, for they are the children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It once happened that a man unloosed a woman\u2019s hair in the street and she came before Rabbi Akiva and he condemned him to pay her 400 zuz. He said, \u201cRabbi, give me time\u201d.  And he gave him time. He caught her standing at the entrance to her courtyard, and he broke a jug of one issar\u2019s worth of oil in front of her. She unloosed her hair and scooped up the oil in her hand and laid her hand on her head. He had set up witnesses up against her and he came before Rabbi Akiva and said to him, \u201cRabbi, should I give one such as this 400 zuz?\u201d He answered, \u201cYou have said nothing.\u201d If a man injures himself, even though he has no right to do so, is not liable. But others who injure him are liable. If a man cuts down his own saplings, even though he has no right to do so, is not liable. But, if others cut them down, they are liable.","2041":"Even though a man pays him that suffers the indignity,  he is not forgiven until he seeks forgiveness from him, for it says:  \u201cTherefore restore the man\u2019s wife\u2026 and he shall pray for you\u201d (Genesis 20:7). And from where do we learn that he who must forgive should not be cruel?  As it says:  \u201cAnd Abraham prayed unto God and God healed Avimelech\u201d (Genesis 20:17). If a man said, \u201cBlind my eye\u201d, or \u201cCut off my hand\u201d, or \u201cBreak my foot\u201d, he that does so is liable. If he added \u201cOn the condition that you will be exempt\u201d, he is still liable. If he said \u201cTear my garment\u201d, or \u201cBreak my jug\u201d, he that does so is liable. If he added \u201cOn the condition that you will be exempt\u201d, he is exempt. If he said, \u201cDo so to so-and-so, on the condition that you will be exempt, he is liable, whether it was an offense against his person or his property.","2042":"If a man stole wood and made it into utensils, or wood and made it into garments, he makes restitution according to the value of the stolen object at the moment of theft. If he stole a pregnant cow and it gave birth, or a sheep ready to be sheared, and he then sheared it, he repays the value of a cow about to bear young, or a sheep ready to be sheared. If he stole a cow, and while it was with him it was impregnated and bore young, or if he stole a sheep and while it was with him it grew wool and he sheared it, he makes restitution according to the value of the stolen object at the moment of theft. This is the general rule: all robbers make restitution according to the value of the stolen object at the moment of theft.","2043":"If he stole a beast and it grew old, or slaves and they grew old, he makes restitution according to their value at the moment of the theft. Rabbi Meir says:  \u201cAs for slaves the thief may say to the owner, \u2018Here is what is yours before you.\u2019\u201d If he stole a coin and it cracked, fruit and it rotted, wine and it turned into vinegar, he must make restitution according to the value at the moment of the theft. But if he stole a coin and it went out of use, or \u201cHeave offering\u201d and it became ritually unclean, or leaven and the time of Passover arrived, or a beast and it was used for a transgression, or became unfit to be offered or it was condemned to be stoned, he may say to the other, \u201cHere is what is yours before you.\u201d","2044":"If he gave something to craftsmen to repair, and they ruined it, they must make restitution. If he gave a carpenter a box, chest or cupboard to repair, and he ruined it, he must make restitution. If a builder undertook to pull down a wall, and he broke the stones or caused damage, he must make restitution. If he was pulling down at the one end and it fell down on the other, he is exempt; However, if it fell due to the blow, he is liable.","2045":"If a man gave wool to a dyer and the cauldron burned it, he must repay him the value of the wool. If he dyed it badly: if the improvement was worth more than the cost of the dying, he must pay him the cost of the dying; if the cost of the dying was worth more than the improvement, he must pay only the value of the improvement. If he told him to dye it red and he dyed it black; black and he dyed it red: Rabbi Meir says:  \u201cThe dyer must pay the cost of the wool.\u201d Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cIf the improvement was worth more than the cost of the dying, he must pay him the cost of the dying; if the cost of the dying was worth more than the improvement, he must pay only the value of the improvement.","2046":"If a man robbed his fellow of the value of a perutah and swore falsely to him, he must take it to him even as far as Medea. He may not give it to his son or to his agent, but he may give it to the agent of the court. If his fellow had died he must return it to his heirs.","2047":"1. If he had repaid the value but had not paid the added fifth, or if he had forgiven him the value but not the added fifth, or if had forgiven him both except for less than a perutah\u2019s worth of the value, he need not go after him. 2. If he had repaid him the added fifth but not the value, or if he had forgiven him the added fifth but not the value, or if he had forgiven both except for a perutah\u2019s worth of the value, he must go after him.","2048":"If he had paid him the value and had sworn falsely to him concerning the added fifth, he must pay a fifth on the fifth and so on until the value of the added fifth becomes less than a perutah\u2019s worth. So too with a deposit, as it says:  \u201cIn a matter of deposit or a pledge or through robbery, or by defrauding his fellow, or by finding something lost and lying about it\u201d (Leviticus 5:21-2, such a one must pay the value and the added fifth and bring a Guilt-offering.

But if he confessed it of himself, he must repay the value and the added fifth and bring a Guilt-offering.","2050":"If a man stole from his father and swore falsely to him, and the father died, he must repay the value and the added fifth to the father\u2019s sons or brothers. If he will not repay or if has does not have with which to repay he must borrow and the creditors come and are repaid.","2051":"If a man said to his son, \u201cQonam, you will not derive any benefit from that which is mine\u201d, and he died, the son may inherit him. But if he moreover said, \u201cBoth during my life and at my death\u201d, when he dies the son may not inherit from him and he must restore what he received from his father\u2019s inheritance to the father\u2019s sons or brothers. If he has nothing, he takes out a loan, and the creditors come and exact payment.","2052":"If a man stole from a convert and swore falsely to him, and the convert died, he must repay the value and the added fifth to the priests, and the Guilt-offering to the altar, as it says:  \u201cIf the man has no kinsman to whom restitution can be made, the amount which is repaid shall go to the priest in addition to the ram of atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him\u201d (Numbers 5:8). If he brought the money and the Guilt-offering and then died, the money shall be given to his sons, and the Guilt-offering shall be left to pasture until it suffers a blemish, when it shall be sold, and its value falls to the Temple treasury.","2053":"If he who had stolen from the convert gave the money to the men of the priestly watch and then died, his inheritors cannot recover it from their the priests hands, as it says, \u201cWhatsoever a man gives to a priest shall be his\u201d (Numbers 5:10). If he gave the money to Yehoyariv, and the Guilt-offering to Yedayah, he has fulfilled his obligation. If he gave the Guilt-offering to Yehoyariv and the money to Yedayah:  if the Guilt-offering still remains, the sons of Yedayah shall offer it; otherwise, he must bring another Guilt-offering. For if a man brought what he had stolen before he offered his Guilt-offering, he has fulfilled his obligation. But if he brought his Guilt-offering before he brought what he had stolen, he has not yet fulfilled his obligation. If he gave the value but not the added fifth, the added fifth does not prevent him from offering the Guilt-offering.","2054":"If a man stole something and fed it to his children, or if he left it in front of them, they are exempt from making restitution. But if it was something which is subject to mortgage (that is, real estate), they are liable to make restitution.

But the Sages say:  \u201cIn either case he should not return them, since in either case the court would exact payment from the property.\u201d","2070":"If a man found bills of divorce, or writs of emancipation or wills, or deeds of gifts, or receipts, he should not return them, for I might say, \u201cthey were written out, and the writer might have changed his mind and decided not to give them.\u201d","2071":"If a man found letters of evaluation, or letters of sustenance, or documents of halitzah or refusal, or documents of arbitration or any document drawn out by the court he should return them. If he found documents in a satchel or bag, or a bundle of documents he should return them. How many count as a bundle of documents? Three tied up together. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  If one found three documents in which one borrowed from three others, they should be returned to the borrower. But if one found three documents in which one loaned to three, they should be returned to the lender. If a man found a document among his documents and he does not know what is its nature, it must be left until Elijah comes. If there were postscripts amongst them, he should do what is stated in the postscript.","2072":"Which found objects belong to the finder and which ones must be proclaimed in the lost and found? These found objects belong to the finder:  if a man found scattered fruit, scattered money, small sheaves in the public domain, cakes of figs, bakers\u2019 loaves, strings of fish, pieces of meat, wool shearings as they come from the country of origin, stalks of flax and strips of purple wool, according to Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cAnything which has in it something unusual, must be proclaimed.  How is this so?  If he found a fig cake with a potsherd in it or a loaf with coins in it he must proclaim them.\u201d Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:  \u201cNew merchandise need not be proclaimed.\u201d","2073":"And these must be proclaimed:  if a man found fruit in a vessel, or an empty vessel; or money in a bag, or an empty bag; piles of fruit or piles of money; three coins one on top of the other; small sheaves in the private domain; home-made loaves of bread; wool shearings as they come from the craftsman\u2019s shop; jugs of wine or jugs of oil, these must be proclaimed.","2074":"If a man found pigeons tied together behind a fence or a hedge or on footpaths in the fields, he may not touch them. If he found an object in the dungheap and it was covered up he may not touch it, but if it was exposed he should take it and proclaim. If he found it in a pile of stones or in an old wall it belongs to him. If he found it in a new wall and it was on the outside of the wall it belongs to him. If it was on the inner side it belongs to the householder. But if the house had been hired to others, even if a man found something within the house, it belongs to him.","2075":"If he found something in a shop, it belongs to him. But if he found it between the counter and the shopkeeper it belongs to the shopkeeper. If he found it in front of the money-changer it belongs to him. But if between the stool and the money-changer it belongs to the money-changer. If a man bought fruit from his fellow or if his fellow sent him fruit and he found coins therein, they belong to him. But if they were tied up he must take them and proclaim them.","2076":"A garment was also included amongst all these things (which one must proclaim, listed in Deut. 22:3). Why was it mentioned separately? To compare other things to it:  to teach you just as a garment is distinct in that it has special marks and it has those who claim it, so too everything that has special marks and those who claim it must be proclaimed.","2077":"For how long must a man proclaim what he has found? Until all of his neighbors know of it, according to Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cAt the three Pilgrimage Festivals and for seven days after the lest festival, to allow him three days to go back to his house, three days to return and one day on which to proclaim his loss.\u201d","2078":"If he named what was lost but could not describe its distinctive marks, he should not give it back to him. And it should not be give to a known deceiver, even if he describes its distinctive marks, as it is said in the verse, Deut. 22:2:  \u201cUntil your fellow claims it\u201d, which is to say until you inquire about your fellow, if he is a deceiver or not. Whatsoever works and eats, let it work and eat while in the finder\u2019s care. But whatsoever does not work and eat should be sold, as it is said in the verse, Deut. 22:2:  \u201cAnd you shall return it to him\u201d, See how you can return it to him. What shall be with the money from the sale? Rabbi Tarfon says:  \u201cHe may use it, therefore if it is lost he is responsible for it.\u201d Rabbi Akiva says:  \u201cHe may not use it, therefore if it is lost he is not responsible for it.\u201d","2079":"If he found scrolls he must read them once every thirty days, and if he does not know how to read he should unroll them. But he may not learn from them something he has not yet learned, nor may another read with him. If he found clothing he must shake it out once every thirty days, and spread it out for the clothing\u2019s own good, but not for his own honor. If he found silver or copper vessels he must use them for their own good but not so as to wear them out. If he found vessels of gold or glass he may not touch them until Elijah comes. If he found a sack or a large basket or anything that is not generally carried about, he may not carry it.","2080":"What counts as lost property? If he found an ass or a cow grazing on the path, this does not count as lost property. But if he found an ass with its trappings turned over, or a cow running in the vineyards, this is lost property. If he returned it and it escaped again, and he returned it and it escaped again, even four or five times, he is obligated to return it yet again, since it is stated (Deut. 22:1):  \u201cYou shall surely return it to your brother\u201d. If the finder lost time at work that was worth a sela (an amount of money), he may not say to the owner, \u201cGive me a sela\u201d.  Rather the owner need only pay him the wages of an unemployed laborer. If there was a court of law in the that place the finder may stipulate before them for damages for time lost. If there was no court of law, before whom can he stipulate? His comes first.","2081":"If he found an animal in a stable, he is not responsible for it even though the stable door was loose and unguarded. But if he found it in the public domain he is responsible for it. If it was in a cemetery he need not contract uncleanness because of it. If his father said to him, \u201cContract uncleanness\u201d, or if he said to him, \u201cDo not return it\u201d, he may not listen to him. If he unloaded the ass fallen under its load and reloaded it and again unloaded it and reloaded it, even four or five times he is still obligated, for it is written, \u201cYou must surely raise it with him\u201d. If the owner went and sat down and said, \u201cSince the commandment is upon you, if you wish to unload, unload\u201d, he is not obligated, for it is written \u201cwith him\u201d. But if the owner was aged or sick, he is obligated. It is a commandment from the Torah to unload but not to reload. Rabbi Shimon says, \u201cTo reload as well.\u201d Rabbi Yose the Galilean says, \u201cIf the beast was carrying more than its proper load he is not obligated to help unload it, for it is written, \u201cunder its load\u201d, which is to say a load which it is able to endure.","2082":"If a man found his own lost property and his father\u2019s, his own takes priority. If his own and that of his teacher, his own takes priority. If he found his father\u2019s and his teacher\u2019s, his teacher\u2019s takes priority for his father brought him into this world, but his teacher who taught him wisdom brings him into the world to come. If his father was a Sage, his father\u2019s takes priority. If his father and teacher each were carrying a load, he must first relieve his teacher and afterward relieve his father. If his father and teacher were each taken captive, he must first ransom his teacher and afterward his father. But if his father was a Sage, he must first ransom his father and afterward his teacher.","2083":"If a man left an animal or utensils in his fellow\u2019s keeping and they were stolen or lost, and his fellow made restitution and did not want to take an oath \u2013 for they have taught:  an unpaid guardian may take an oath and be exempt from liability \u2013 if the thief is found he must make twofold restitution, and if he slaughtered or sold the sheep or ox he must make four of fivefold restitution. To whom does he pay? He with whom the money was deposited. If his fellow takes an oath and does not want to make restitution, if the thief is found he must make twofold restitution, and if he slaughtered or sold the sheep or ox he must make four of fivefold restitution. To whom does he pay? To the owner of the property deposited.","2084":"If a man rented a cow from his fellow and lent it to another, and it died a natural death, the hirer must swear that it died a natural death and the borrower must repay its value to the renter. Rabbi Yose said: \u201cHow can this one make business out of his friend\u2019s cow?  Rather the value of the cow returns to the owner.\u201d","2085":"If a man said to two others, \u201cI have robbed one of you 100 zuz and I do not know which of you it is\u201d, or \u201cThe father of one of you left me 100 zuz and I do not know whose father it was\u201d, he must give each of them 100 zuz, since he himself admitted liability.","2086":"Two men deposited money with a third, the one 100 zuz and the other 200 zuz. Afterward one claimed that he deposited 200 and the other claimed that he deposited 200. He gives this one 100 zuz and this one 100 zuz and the rest remains until Elijah comes. Rabbi Yose says:  \u201cIf so, what does the deceiver lose?  Rather the whole is left until Elijah comes.\u201d","2087":"So too, two men deposited vessels with a third, one worth 100 zuz and the other worth 1000 zuz. Afterward one claimed that the valuable one was his and the other claimed that the valuable one was his. He gives the less valuable one to one of them and from the value of the more valuable one he gives the value of the lesser one to the other person, and the rest remains until Elijah comes. Rabbi Yose says:  \u201cIf so, what does the deceiver lose?  Rather the whole is left until Elijah comes.\u201d","2088":"If a man deposited produce with his fellow, even if it should perish he may not touch it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  \u201cHe may sell it before a court of law, since he is like someone who returns a lost object to its owners.\u201d","2089":"When a man leaves produce for his fellow, and his fellow returns it to the owner he may exact reductions due to natural depletion of the produce. For wheat and rice, nine half kabs to the kor. For barley and durra nine kabs to the kor. For spelt and linseed three seahs to the kor. All is in proportion to the quantity and according to the time it is left. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri said:  \u201cBut what do the mice care about the quantity?  Won\u2019t they eat the same amount whether there is a lot or a little? Rather, he may exact a reduction from only one kor. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cIf the quantity was great he may not exact any reduction, since the produce increases in bulk.\u201d","2090":"With wine he may exact a reduction of one-sixth. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cOne-fifth.\u201d He may exact of him three logs in every one hundred logs of oil one log and a half for sediment and one log and a half for absorption. If the oil was refined he may not exact for sediment. If the jars were old he may not exact for absorption. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cAlso if a man sells to his fellow through the year, the buyer must undertake to accept a reduction of one and a half logs because of sediment.","2091":"If a man left a jar with his fellow to guard and the owner did not assign it a special place to be kept and the guardian moved it and it broke: If it was broken while he was handling it: If for his own sake he is liable. If for the sake of the jar, he is not liable. But if it was broken after he had put it in place, whether he moved it for his own sake or for the sake of the jar, he is exempt. If the owner had assigned it a special place, and the guardian moved it and it broke: Whether or not it broke while he was handling it or after he had put it in its place; If for his own sake he is liable, if for the sake of the jar, he is not liable.","2092":"If a man left money in his fellow\u2019s keeping and his fellow bound it up and hung it over his back, or delivered it to his son or his daughter who were minors, or locked it up improperly, he is liable since he did not guard in the way of guardians. If he guarded it in the way of guardians he is exempt.","2093":"If a man left coins with a money-changer: If they were tied up in a bag, he may not use them. Therefore, if they were lost, he is not responsible. If they were loose, he may use they were. Therefore, they were was lost, he is responsible. If a man left coins with a householder, Whether they were loose or tied up, he may not use them. Therefore, if they were lost he his not responsible. A shopkeeper is like a householder, according to Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says a shopkeeper is like a money-changer.","2094":"If a man makes personal use of a deposit: Bet Shammai holds that he is at a disadvantage whether the value rises or falls. Bet Hillel says:  He must restore the deposit at its value at the time at which he put it to use. Rabbi Akiva says: He must restore the deposit at its value at the time at which it is claimed. One who expresses his intention to use a deposit for personal use: Bet Shammai says he is liable for any subsequent damage to the deposit, as if he had already made use of it. Bet Hillel says:  He is not liable until he actually uses it, as it says (Exodus 22:7):  \u201cIf he had not put his hand onto his neighbor\u2019s property\u201d. How is this so? If he tilted the jug and took a quarter-log of wine and the jug was then broken, he only pays the quarter-log. If he lifted it and then took a quarter-log and the jug was then broken, he pays for the whole jug.","2095":"Gold acquires silver, but silver does not acquire gold. Copper acquires silver, but silver does not acquire copper. Bad coins acquire good coins but good coins do not acquire bad coins. An unminted coin acquires a minted coin, but a minted coin does not acquire an unminted coin. Movable property acquires coined money, but coined money does not acquire movable property. This is the general rule:  movable property acquires other movable property.","2096":"How is this so? If the buyer drew the produce away from the seller but did not give over the money, he cannot retract. If the buyer gave the money but did not draw the produce away from the seller, he can retract. But they said:  \u201cHe that exacted punishment from the generation of the flood and the generation of the dispersion will exact punishment from one who does not keep by his word. Rabbi Shimon says:  \u201cHe that has the money has the upper hand.\u201d","2097":"Fraud is an overcharge of 4 pieces of silver out of 24 pieces of silver, which make up a sela, one-sixth of the purchase price. Until what time may he that is defrauded retract the sale? Until he has time to show his purchase to a merchant or to his kinsman. Rabbi Tarfon gave instruction in Lud:  \u201cFraud is an overcharge of 8 pieces of silver to the seller, a third of the purchase price\u201d, and the merchants of Lod celebrated. He said to them:  \u201cHe may retract any time within a whole day.\u201d They said to him:  \u201cLeave us as we were, Rabbi Tarfon\u201d, and they reverted to the teaching of the Sages.","2098":"Both the buyer and the seller are subject to the law of fraud. Just as the ordinary person is subject to the law of fraud so too is the merchant. Rabbi Judah said:  \u201cThe law of fraud does not apply to the merchant.\u201d He who has been subjected to fraud has the upper hand: if he wants he may say to him, \u201cGive me back my money or give me back the amount you defrauded me.\u201d","2099":"How much may be missing from a sela and still not fall within the rule of fraud? Rabbi Meir says:  \u201cFour issars, one issar per dinar.\u201d Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cFour pondions, one pondion per dinar.\u201d Rabbi Shimon says:  \u201cEight pondions, two pondions per dinar.\u201d","2100":"Until when may he that is defrauded return the coin? In large towns until he has had time to show it to a money-changer. In villages until the Sabbath eve. If he that had given the coin recognized it, even after twelve months he should accept it in return, but if he does not accept it the one who received it only has a cause for complaint against him. And it is permitted to use it for redeeming the Second Tithe without concern, for he who would not receive it is but only a cheapskate.","2101":"Fraud is four pieces of silver. A claim is a minimum of two pieces of silver. An admission is a minimum of that which is worth a perutah. There are five rules involving that which is worth a perutah: An admission is a minimum of that which is worth a perutah. A woman can be betrothed with that which is worth a perutah. Someone who benefits a perutah\u2019s worth from that which belongs to the sanctuary has committed sacrilege. One who finds that which is worth a perutah must proclaim it as a lost object. One who steals that which is worth a perutah from his fellow and swears falsely to him that he did not steal it, must go after him to return it even as far as Medea.","2102":"There are five cases in which one must add a fifth:One who eats terumah, or the terumah taken from the tithe, or the terumah from a tithe taken from doubtfully tithed produce, or dough offering, or first fruits, must add a fifth to the value of the principle when he makes restitution. One that redeems the fruit of a fourth year plant, or his second tithe, must add a fifth. One that redeems that which he dedicated to the Temple must add a fifth. One that derives a perutah\u2019s worth of benefit from that which belongs to the sanctuary must add a fifth when he makes restitution. One who steals that which is worth a perutah from his fellow must add a fifth when he makes restitution.","2103":"These are the things to which the laws of fraud through overcharging do not apply: The sale of slaves, debt documents, land and what belongs to the Temple. They are not subject to twofold restitution, nor fourfold or fivefold restitution. An unpaid guardian does not take an oath on their account, that he did not damage them nor does a paid guardian make compensation if they are lost on his watch. Rabbi Shimon says:  \u201cHoly Things for which he is responsible, are subject to the laws of fraud through overcharging, and Holy Things for which he is not responsible are not subject to the laws of fraud through overcharging.\u201d Rabbi Judah says: \u201cAlso one who sells a Torah scroll, and an animal or a pearl they are not subject to the laws of fraud through overcharging.\u201d They said to him:  \u201cThey only said these.\u201d","2104":"Just as the laws of fraud apply to buying and selling, so to do they apply to the spoken word. One may not say, \u201cHow much is this object?, if he does not wish to buy it. If one had repented, another should not say to him, \u201cRemember your earlier deeds\u201d. If one descended from converts, another should not say to him, \u201cRemember the deeds of your ancestors\u201d. For it is said (Exodus 22:21), \u201cAnd a stranger you shall not wrong or oppress.\u201d","2105":"Produce may not be mixed together with other produce, even new produce with new produce, and needless to say new with old. In truth they permitted sharp wine to be mixed with weak wine, since this improves the taste. Wine lees may not be mixed with wine, but the seller may give the buyer the lees that come from the same wine. One whose wine has been mixed with water may not sell it in a store unless he informs the buyer and not to a merchant even if he has informed him, since the merchant would buy it only to deceive with it. In a place where they are accustomed to put water in wine, they may do so.","2106":"A merchant may buy from five threshing floors and put the produce into a storage chamber, or from five wine-presses and put into one jug, as long as he doesn\u2019t intend to mix them for purposes of fraud. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cA storekeeper should not distribute parched corn or nuts to children, for that accustoms them to come only to him.\u201d But the Sages permit. And he may not lower the price. But the Sages says:  \u201cLet him be remembered for good if he lowers the price.\u201d He may not sift crushed beans, according to Abba Shaul. But the Sages permit. But they agree that he should not sift them only at the entry of the storage chamber, since he would be a deceiver of the eye. He should not beautify what he sells, whether humans, cattle or utensils.","2107":"What is usury and what is increase when a man lends a sela for five dinars, or two seahs of wheat for three, because he bites off too much. And what is increase? When a man increases his gains by selling produce. How is this so? If one bought wheat at a golden dinars =25 silver dinars for a kor when such was the market price, and then wheat rose to thirty silver dinars per kor. If he said to him, \u201cGive me my wheat since I would sell it and buy wine with the proceeds\u201d and the other said, \u201cLet your wheat be reckoned with me at thirty dinars and you now have a claim on me for wine to that value, although the creditor has no wine.","2108":"One who lends money to his fellow may not dwell in his courtyard for free or rent it from him at a reduced rate, since that counts as usury. One may increase rent-charge not paid in advance but not purchase price not paid in advance. How so? If his fellow rented him his courtyard, and said to him, \u201cIf you pay me now the cost is 10 selas per year, but if you pay me on a monthly basis, the rent is one sela per month\u201d, this is permitted. However, if he sold him his field, and said to him, \u201cIf you pay me now it is yours for 1,000 zuz, but if you pay me at the time of threshing it will be 1,200 zuz\u201d, it is forbidden.","2109":"If a man sold a field, and the buyer gave him part of the price and he said to the buyer, \u201cPay me the rest of the price whenever you wish and then take what is yours\u201d, this is forbidden. If a man lent another money on the security of his field and said to him, \u201cIf you do not pay me within three years it will be mine\u201d, then it becomes his. This is what Boethus the son of Zunin used to do with the consent of the Sages.","2110":"One may not set up a shopkeeper on the condition of receiving half the profit, or give him the money to buy produce on the condition of receiving half the profit, unless he pays him his wage as a laborer. One may not set out his hens for another to raise them and hatch their eggs in order to share the profits, nor evaluate calves or foals and give them to his fellow to raise in order to share the profit, unless he pays him a wage for his labor and cost of the food. But one may receive the care of calves and foals in return for half the profits, and rear them until they reach a third of their growth, and donkeys until they can carry a burden.","2111":"One may evaluate cows and donkeys and anything that works and eats and give them to one\u2019s fellow to raise in order to share the profit. Where the custom is to share the offspring immediately at birth, they do so; and where the custom is to first rear them and then give them over to the owner, they do so. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  \u201cOne may evaluate a calf with its mother, and a foal with its mother and give them to one\u2019s fellow to raise in order to share the profit. A tenant may offer increased rent in exchange for a loan to improve his field, without fearing that this is usury.","2112":"One may not accept a flock from an Israelite on \u201ciron terms\u201d that the one who tends the flock shares the profits from the flock and accepts full responsibility for their value. But one may accept a flock from a gentile on \u201ciron terms\u201d and money may be borrowed from them and one may lend them money. The same is true with a resident alien. An Israelite may lend the money of a gentile with the knowledge and consent of the gentile but not with the knowledge of an Israelite.","2113":"One may not set a price for produce before its market-price is known. After its market-price is known, one may set a price, for even though this one does not have the produce another does have it. If he was the first to harvest his crop, he may set a price with his fellow over grain stacked in a heap, or over grapes in their harvesting basket, or over olives in a vat, or over the clay-balls of the potter, or over lime as soon as the limestone is sunk in the kiln. One may set a price for manure at any time of the year. Rabbi Yose says:  \u201cOne may not set a price over manure unless the seller has manure on the dungheap.\u201d But the Sages permit it. One may set the price at the cheapest rate that will be at the time of delivery. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cEven if he didn\u2019t set the price at the cheapest rate he may say, \u201cGive me at the such a price or give me back my money.\u201d","2114":"A landowner may lend his tenants wheat to be repaid in wheat, if it is for planting but not if it is for food. For Rabban Gamaliel used to lend his tenants wheat to be repaid in wheat when it was for planting. And if he lent it when the price was high and it afterward fell, or when it was low and it afterward rose, he used to take wheat back at the lower rate, not because such was the rule but because he wanted to be strict upon himself.","2115":"One should not say to his fellow, \u201cLend me a kor of wheat and I will repay you at the threshing time\u201d, but he may say, \u201cLend it to me until my son comes\u201d, or \u201cuntil I find my key\u201d. But Hillel used to forbid this. Moreover Hillel used to say, \u201cA woman may not lend a loaf of bread to her neighbor unless she determines its value in money, lest wheat should rise in price and they are found to be engaging in usury.\u201d","2116":"One may say to his fellow, \u201cHelp me weed and I will help you weed\u201d or \u201cHelp me hoe and I will help you hoe.\u201d But one may not say, \u201cHelp me weed and I will help you hoe\u201d, or \u201cHelp me hoe and I will help you weed\u201d. All days of the dry season are accounted alike, and all days of the rainy season are accounted alike. One may not say to another, \u201cHelp me plow in the dry season and I will help you plow in the rainy season.\u201d Rabban Gamaliel says: \u201cThere is interest that is paid in advance and interest that is paid afterward. How is this so? If a one intended to borrow from another and made him a present and said, \u201cThis is so that you will lend to me\u201d, this is interest that is paid in advance. If one borrowed from another and repaid it to him, and then sent a present and said, \u201cThis is for your money of which you have not had use while it was with me\u201d, this is interest that is paid afterward. Rabbi Shimon says: \u201cThere is interest paid in words:  one may not say to his creditor, \u201cKnow that such and such a person has come form such and such a place.\u201d","2117":"These are the one who transgress a negative commandment:  the lender, the borrower, the guarantor, and the witnesses. And the Sages say, \u201cThe scribe also.\u201d They transgress the commandment, \u201cYou will not give him your money upon interest\u201d and \u201cYou shall not be to him as a creditor\u201d and \u201cYou shall not put a stumbling block before the blind, and you will fear your God, I am the Lord\u201d (Leviticus 19:14).","2118":"If one hired craftsmen and they deceived each other, they have no legally valid complaint against each other, but only cause for complaint. If one hired a donkey-driver or a wagon-driver to bring litter-bearers or pipers for a bride or for the dead, or laborers to take his flax out of the steep, or any matter that would be lost if delayed, and they retracted, if it was a place where there were no others who could be hired for the same wage he may hire others at their expense or he may deceive them.","2119":"If one hired craftsmen and they retracted, they are at a disadvantage. If the householder retracted he is at a disadvantage. Whosoever changes the conditions of a contract is at a disadvantage. And anyone who retracts is at a disadvantage.","2120":"If one hires a donkey to drive it through hill country and he drove it through a valley, or to drive it through the valley and he drove it through the hill country, even though the distance of each was ten miles, if the donkey died the hirer is liable. If a man hired a donkey and it went blind or was conscripted into the king\u2019s service, the owner may say to the hirer, \u201cHere is yours before you\u201d and he need not replace the donkey. But if it died or was broken, he must give him a new donkey. If one hires a donkey to drive it through hill country and he drove it through a valley, if it slipped he is not liable, but if it overheated he is liable. If one hires a donkey to drive it through a valley and he drove it through hill country, if it slipped he is liable, but if it overheated he is not liable. But if it overheated due to the ascent he is liable.","2121":"If one hired a cow to plow in the hill country and he plowed in the valley, if the plowshare was broken he is exempt. If one hired a cow to plow in the valley and he plowed in the hill country, if the plowshare was broken he is liable. If one hired it to thresh beans and he threshed grain and the cow slipped and was injured, he is exempt. If one hired it to thresh grain and he threshed beans and the cow slipped and was injured, he is liable.","2122":"If one hired a donkey to carry wheat and he used it to carry a like weight of barley, he is liable if the donkey was injured. If he hired it to carry grain and he used it to carry a like weight of chopped straw he is liable, since the greater bulk is more difficult to carry. If he hired it to carry a letech of wheat and it carried a letech of barley he is not liable. But if he increased the weight, he is liable. What increase in weight renders him liable? Symmachos says in the name of Rabbi Meir:  \u201cOne seah for a camel and three kavs for a donkey.\u201d","2123":"All craftsmen are accounted paid guardians. But all that have said, \u201cTake what is yours and give me the money\u201d, are accounted unpaid guardians. If one man said to another, \u201cGuard that for me and I will guard this for you\u201d, he is accounted a paid guardian. If one said, \u201cGuard this for me\u201d, and the other said \u201cPut it down in front of me\u201d, he is accounted an unpaid guardian.","2124":"If one gave a loan and took a pledge he is accounted a paid guardian. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cIf he lent him money he is accounted an unpaid guardian; if he lent him produce he is accounted a paid guardian.\u201d Abba Shaul, \u201cOne may hire out a poor man\u2019s pledge and thereby reduce the debt, for in such a way he is like one who returns lost property.\u201d","2125":"If one moved a jar from place to place and broke it, whether he is a paid guardian or an unpaid guardian, he may take an oath that he did not break it through neglect and be exempt from liability. Rabbi Eliezer says:  \u201cI too have heard that in either case he may take an oath, but I wonder whether in either case the oath is valid.\u201d","2126":"If one hired laborers and told them to work early or to work late, he has no right to compel them to do so where the custom is not to work early or not to work late. In a place where the custom is to give them their food he should give it to them, and where the custom is to provide them with sweet food, he must give it to them. Everything should follow local custom. It once happened that Rabbi Yochanan ben Mattia said to his son:  \u201cGo and hire laborers for us\u201d.  He went and struck a deal to provide them with food.  When he came to his father, his father said to him, \u201cMy son, even if you make them a banquet like Solomon\u2019s in his time you will not have fulfilled your obligation to them.  For they are sons of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. But, rather, before they begin to work go and say to them, \u201cOn condition that I am not bound to give you more than bread and beans only.\u201d Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  \u201cIt was not necessary to speak thus, for everything should follow local use.\u201d","2127":"These may eat of the fruits among which they work by the law of the Torah: one who works on that which is still connected to the ground may eat of it when the work is finished at the time of harvest; and one who works on that which is already detached from the ground may eat of it before the work is completely finished. This applies only to that which grows from the ground. These are they that may not eat; one that works on what is still growing while the work is still unfinished; and one that works on what is already detached from the ground after the work is finished, and one may not eat of what does not grow from the soil.","2128":"If one was working with his hands but not with his feet, with his feet but not with his hands, or even with his shoulders only, he still may eat. Rabbi Yose bar Rabbi Judah says, \u201cOnly if he works with both his hands and his feet.\u201d","2129":"If one was working with figs he may not eat grapes, and if among grapes he may not eat figs. But he may refrain from eating until he reaches the best produce and then eat. In no case have they said that he may eat save during the time of his work. But because of the principle of restoring lost property to its owner they have said, \u201cField laborers may eat as they go from one furrow to another or as they return from the winepress.  And a donkey may eat while it is unloading.\u201d","2130":"A laborer may eat cucumbers even to a denar\u2019s worth, and dates even to a denar\u2019s worth. Rabbi Elazar ben Hisma says:  \u201cA laborer may not eat more than the value of his wages. But the Sages permit it, but they teach a man not to be gluttonous as to close the door against himself.","2131":"One may exact terms for himself and for his son or daughter that are of age, and for his slave or female slave that are of age, and for his wife, since these have understanding. But he may not exact terms for his son and daughter that are not of age, or for his slave or female slave that are not of age, or for his cattle, since these have no understanding.","2132":"If one hired laborers to work among his fourth-year plantings, they not eat from them. If he had not told them that they were fourth-year plantings he must first redeem the fruit and then allow them to eat. If his fig-cakes broke up or his jars burst open, they may not eat from them. If he had not told them that they were liable to be tithed he must first separate the tithes and then allow them to eat.","2133":"Those that guard gathered produce may eat from it because that is the custom of the land and not because that is the law of the Torah. There are four kinds of guardians:  an unpaid guardian, a borrower, a paid guardian and a hirer. An unpaid guardian may take an oath that he had not been neglectful in every case of loss or damage and be free of liability. A borrower must make restitution in every case. A paid guardian or a hirer may take an oath if the beast was injured, or taken captive or dead, but he must make restitution if it was lost or stolen.","2134":"If one wolf attacked the flock that he was watching it does not count as an unavoidable accident for which no blame is placed on the guardian. Two wolves do count as an unavoidable accident. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cIn a time where wolves are commonly attacking the settlements, even one wolf is considered to be an unavoidable accident.\u201d Two dogs do not count as an unavoidable accident. Yadua the Babylonian said in the name of Rabbi Meir says:  \u201cIf two dogs came from one direction they do not count as an unavoidable accident, but if they came from two directions they count as an unavoidable accident. A bandit counts as an unavoidable accident. A lion or a bear or a leopard or a panther or a serpent counts as an unavoidable accident. When is this so? When they come of themselves.  But if he took the flock to a place of wild animals or bandits they do not count as an unavoidable accident.","2135":"If a beast died a natural death this counts as an unavoidable accident for which a hirer or paid guardian is not liable. But if he tortured it and it died it does not count as an unavoidable accident and the hirer and paid guardian would be liable. If it was led up to the top of a crag and it fell down and died, this does not count as an unavoidable accident. An unpaid guardian may make a stipulation that he will be exempt from taking an oath, and a borrower may make a stipulation that he will be exempt from making restitution, and a paid guardian and a hirer may make a stipulation that they will be exempt from taking an oath or from making restitution.","2136":"If one makes a stipulation contrary to that which is written in the Torah he stipulation is void. Any stipulation that mentions first the action is void. Any stipulation that can in the end be fulfilled and was laid down as a condition from the beginning, such a condition is valid.","2137":"If one borrowed a cow together with the service of its owner, or hired its owner together with the cow, or if he borrowed the service of the owner or hired him, and afterward borrowed the cow, and the cow died he is not liable, for it is written, \u201cIf its owner was with it no restitution need be made\u201d (Exodus 22:14). But if he first borrowed the cow and afterward borrowed or hired the service of its owner, and the cow died, he is liable, for it is written, \u201cIts owner not being with it, he must make restitution\u201d (Exodus 22:13).","2138":"If one borrowed a cow, and borrowed it for half a day and hired it for half a day; or borrowed it for one day and hired it for the next; or if he borrowed one cow, and hired another and the cow died if he that lent the cow says: \u201cIt was the borrowed cow that died\u201d, or \u201cOn the day when it was borrowed it died\u201d, or \u201cDuring the time when it was borrowed it died\u201d and the other one says: \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, he is liable. If the hirer says, \u201cIt is the hired one that died\u201d, or \u201cOn the day when it was hired it died\u201d, and the other says, \u201cI do not know\u201d, he is not liable. If the one says, \u201cIt was borrowed\u201d, and the other says, \u201cIt was hired\u201d, the hirer must take an oath that it was the hired one that died. If the one says, \u201cI do not know\u201d, and the other says, \u201cI do not know\u201d, they share in the loss.","2139":"If one borrowed a cow and the owner sent it by the hand of his son or his slave or his agent, or by the hand of the borrower\u2019s son or slave or agent and it died on the way, the borrower is not liable. But if the borrower said, \u201cSend it to me by the hand of my son or my slave or my agent, or by the hand of your son or your slave or your agent\u201d, or if the lender said, \u201cI am sending it to you by the hand of my son or my slave or my agent\u201d, or \u201cby the hand of your son or your slave or your agent\u201d, and the borrower said, \u201cSend it\u201d, and he sent it and it died on the way, the borrower is liable. So, too, when the cow is returned.","2140":"If one swapped a cow for a donkey, and it gave birth, So too if one sold his slave and she gave birth, And one says, \u201cIt was born before I sold her\u201d, and the other says, \u201cIt was born after I bought her\u201d, they shall divide the value of what was born. If one had two slaves, one large and the other small, or two fields, one large and the other small,And he sold one of them, If the buyer says, \u201cI bought the large one\u201d and the other says, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, the buyer can rightly claim the large one. If the seller said, \u201cI sold the small one\u201d and the buyer said, \u201cI do not know\u201d, he may only take the small one. If one said, \u201cIt was the large one\u201d and the other said, \u201cIt was the small one\u201d, the seller must take an oath that it was the small one that he sold and the buyer can only take the small one. If one said, \u201cI do not know\u201d, and the other said, \u201cI do not know\u201d, they shall divide the value of both slaves or fields.","2141":"If one sold his olive trees as firewood and they bore fruit that gave less than a quarter-log of oil per seah, this belongs to the new owner of the olive trees. If they bore fruit that gave a quarter-log of oil or more per seah, and the one said, \u201cIt was my trees that produced it\u201d, and the other said, \u201cIt was my land that produced it\u201d, let them share the produce. If a flood washed away a man\u2019s olive trees and set them in the midst of his fellow\u2019s field where they bore fruit, and the one said, \u201cIt was my trees that produced it\u201d, and the other said, \u201cIt was my land that produced it\u201d, let them share the produce.","2142":"If one leased a house to his fellow in the rainy season, he cannot make him leave it during the time from Sukkot to Pesach. In the summer, he must give him thirty days warning. And in large cities, whether it is during the rainy season or the summer he must give twelve months warning. If one leased a shop to his fellow, whether in large cities or small towns, he must give twelve months warning. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  \u201cIf it is a shop occupied by bakers or dyers he must give three years warning.","2143":"If one rented a house to his fellow, he is obligated to provide it with a door, a bolt a lock and anything which is the work of a craftsman. However, that which is not the work of a craftsman, the tenant must make himself. The manure which collects in the courtyard belongs to the owner of the house, and the tenant can only claim the refuse from the oven and the stove.","2144":"If one rented a house to his fellow by the year and the year was made a leap year, the extra month goes to the tenant. If he rented it by the month and the year was made a leap year, the extra month goes to the owner. It once happened in Tzippori that a person leased a bath-house from his fellow at \u201ctwelve golden dinars a year, one dinar per month\u201d, and when the year became a leap year the case came before Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel and Rabbi Yose, and they said:  \u201cLet them share the extra month.\u201d","2145":"If one rented a house to his fellow and it fell down, the owner must build him a new house. If it was small he may not make it larger, and if it was large he may not make it smaller. If it was one house, he may not make it two; if it was two houses he may not make it one. He may not reduce or increase the number of windows, unless it is with both of their consent.","2146":"If one leased a field from his fellow and the custom of the place was to cut the crops, he must cut them; If the custom was to uproot them, he must uproot them; If the custom was to plough after reaping, he must plough. Everything should follow local custom. Just as they share the grain, so too they share the chopped straw and the stubble. Just as they share the wine, so too they share the dead branches and the reeds used to prop the vines. And both parties must at the outset provide their share of the reeds.","2147":"If one leased a field from his fellow and it was an irrigated field or a field with trees, and the spring dried up or the trees were cut down, he may not give the owner less than his agreed rental. But if he had said, \u201cLease me this irrigated field, or this field with trees\u201d, and the spring dried up or the trees were cut down, he may give less than the prescribed rental.","2148":"If one leased a field from his fellow and he let it lie fallow, they assess how much it was likely to have yielded and he must pay the owner accordingly, since he wrote in the leasing agreement:  \u201cIf I suffer the land to lie fallow and do not till it, I will pay thee at the rate of its highest yield.\u201d","2149":"If one leased a field from his fellow and he did not want to weed it, and he said to the owner, \u201cWhat do you care, as long as I pay you the agreed rental?\u201d, they do not listen to him, for the owner can say to him, \u201cTomorrow you will leave the field and it won\u2019t bring forth anything but weeds.\u201d","2150":"If one leased a field from his fellow and it was not fruitful, if there was enough produce to make a heap, he must still tend to it.

Rather, he must tend to it only if it yields as much grain as was sown there.\u201d","2151":"If one leased a field from his fellow and the locusts devoured the crop or it was blasted by strong winds which caused the grain to be prematurely separated from the stalks, if it was a region-wide mishap he may reduce the amount of the rental agreement. If it was not a region-wide mishap, he may not reduce the amount of the rental agreement. Rabbi Judah says: \u201cIf he had leased it from him for a fixed amount of money, in neither case may he reduce the amount of the rental agreement.\u201d","2152":"If one leased a field from his fellow in return for ten kors of wheat a year and it produced bad wheat, he may pay him out of this crop. If it produced good wheat he may not say, \u201cI will buy other wheat from the market\u201d, rather he must pay him from the crop of that field.","2153":"If one leased a field from his fellow with the condition that he sow barley, he may not sow wheat; But if he leased the field with the condition that he sow wheat, he may sow barley. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel forbids this. If one leased a field from his fellow with the condition that he sow grain, he may not sow beans; But if he leased the field with the condition that he sow beans, he may sow grain. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel forbids this.","2154":"If one leased a field from his fellow for but a few years he may not sow flax and he has no right to cut beams from the sycamore tree. If he leased it for seven years he may sow flax the first year and he has a right to cut beams from the sycamore tree.","2155":"If one leased a field from his fellow for \u201ca week of years\u201d for 700 zuz, the Seventh Year is included in the number. If he leased it for \u201cseven years\u201d for 700 zuz, the Seventh Year is not included in the number.","2156":"One that is hired during the day collects his wages all during the ensuing night. One that is hired during the night collects his wages all during the ensuing day. One that is hired by the hour collects his wages all during the ensuing day or the ensuing night. If one was hired by the week, or by the month, or by the year, or by the week of years, if his time of hire expired during the day, he collects his wages all during the ensuing day. If his time of hire expired during the night, he collects his wages all during the ensuing  night and day.","2157":"The laws \u201cYou must pay him his wages on the same day\u201d and \u201cThe wages of a laborer shall not remain with you until the morning\u201d apply both to the hire of a man or of a beast or of utensils. When is this so? When the employee has laid claim to it, but if he had not laid claim to it the employer does not commit a transgression. If he gave him a draft on a shopkeeper or moneychanger the employer does not commit a transgression even though the employee has not yet collected. If an employee claimed his wages within the set time he may take an oath and take his wages. But if the set time had passed he may not take an oath and take his wages. If witnesses testified that he had claimed his wages at the set time and was not paid, he may take an oath and receive his wages. The law \u201cYou must pay him his wages on the same day\u201d  applies also to the resident alien, but not the law, \u201cThe wages of a laborer shall not remain with you until the morning\u201d.","2158":"If one lent one\u2019s fellow, he may exact a pledge from him only with the permission of a court, and he may not enter his house to take the pledge, as it is states, \u201cYou shall stand outside\u201d (Deut. 24:1. If the borrower had two utensils, he may take one but must give back the other. And he must give back the pillow at night and the plow during the day. And if the creditor dies he need not return the pledge to his heirs. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  \u201cEven to the debtor himself he need only return the pledge within thirty days of the loan, and after thirty days he may sell it with the consent of the court. A pledge may not be taken from a widow, whether she be rich or poor, as it states, \u201cDo not take the a widow\u2019s garment as a pledge\u201d (Deut. 24:17). If one takes a millstone as a pledge he violates a negative commandment and he is also in violation of both parts of the millstone, as it states, \u201cDo not take a mill or an upper millstone as a pledge\u201d (Deut. 24:6). And they didn\u2019t say just an upper millstone or a mill but anything that is necessary for food, as it states, \u201cfor that would be taking someone\u2019s life as a pledge\u201d (ibid.).","2159":"If a house and an upper room belonging to two persons fell down, the two share in the wood and the stones and the earth.

Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cHe would then after being reimbursed have been dwelling on his fellow\u2019s property and he should therefore pay him rent.  Rather the owner of the upper room should rebuild both the house below and the upper room and put a roof on the upper room, and live in the house below until the other repays him what he has spent.\u201d","2162":"So, too, if an olive press was built in a rock and another had a garden on top of it, and the olive press was in part broken down, the owner of the garden may come down and sow below until the other rebuilds the ceiling of his olive press. If a wall or a tree fell into the public domain and caused damage, the owner is not liable to make restitution. If a set time had been given to him to cut down the tree or pull down the wall, and they fell down within the time, he is not liable. If after that time, he is liable.","2163":"If one\u2019s wall was near his fellow\u2019s garden and it fell down and his fellow said to him, \u201cClear away your stones\u201d, and he answered, \u201cThey have become yours\u201d, they do not listen to him. If after the other had accepted he said to him, \u201cHere is your expenditures and I will take back what is mine\u201d, they do not listen to him.

One who removes his manure into the public domain:  from the time he removes it another may take it to manure his fields. One may not soak clay or make bricks in the public domain, but clay may be kneaded in the public domain but not bricks. One who builds in the public domain:  one brings the stones and another builds (immediately). And if he causes damage, he pays what he has damaged.

He is not able to marry a slave-woman, nor is he able to marry a woman who is free.   Is he to refrain from marrying?

For it is said, \u201cHe did not create it to be a waste; but formed it for inhabitation\u201d (Isaiah 45:18).

And concerning a small garden which was surrounded by a row of vines   that if it has space for the grape-gatherer and his basket on one side, and space for the grape-gatherer and his basket on the other side, it may be sown with seed; but if not, it may not be sown with seed.","2183":"They stated three things before Rabbi Yishmael, and he pronounced none of them either unlawful or lawful; and Rabbi Joshua ben Matya explained them.One who lances an abscess on the Sabbath: if it was to make an opening he is liable; if it was to bring out the pus, he is exempt. And concerning one who hunts a snake on the Sabbath: that if he was occupied with it in order that it should not bite him, he is innocent; but if that he might use it as a remedy, he is guilty. And concerning Ironian stewpots: that they do not contract impurity when under the same tent as a corpse; but become impure if they are carried by a zav.

In all such cases a man is unclean unless there is an act of touching and also an act of carrying, or an act of carrying and also the fact of being under the same roof-space.\u201d This is the general rule: in whatever case the means of causing defilement are of one category, he is unclean; if they are of two categories, he is clean.\u201d","2190":"Food which is in separate pieces does not combine together to receive impurity, according to Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas.

But the Sages say: \u201cThey are all liable to uncleanness, except those used by wool dealers for carrying raw wool.\u201d","2193":"A sling whose pocket is woven is susceptible to impurity. If it is of leather, Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas pronounces it not susceptible to impurity, and the Sages pronounce it susceptible to impurity.

But the sages forbid them.","2200":"Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah allows three things and the Sages forbid them:His cow used to go out with the strap which she had between her horns; One may curry cattle on a festival; And one may grind pepper in its own mill. Rabbi Judah says: one may not curry cattle on a festival, because it may cause a wound, but one may comb them. But the Sages say: one may not curry them, and one may not even comb them.","2201":"The following cases are examples of the lenient rulings of Beth Shammai and of the rigorous rulings of Beth Hillel.An egg which is laid on a festival   Beth Shammai says: it may be eaten, and Beth Hillel says: it may not be eaten. Beth Shammai says: yeast as much as an olive in quantity, and leavened food as much as a date, and Beth Hillel says: as much as an olive in quantity in both cases.","2202":"A beast which was born on a festival   all agree that it is permitted; and a chicken which was hatched from the egg   all agree that it is forbidden. He who slaughters a wild animal or a bird on a festival   Beth Shammai says: he may dig with a pronged tool and cover up the blood , but Beth Hillel says: he may not slaughter unless he has had earth made ready. But they agree that if he did slaughter he should dig with a pronged tool and cover up the blood, and that the ashes of a stove count as being prepared for the holiday.","2203":"Beth Shammai says: produce pronounced ownerless with respect to the poor only is counted as ownerless. But Beth Hillel says: it is not counted as ownerless unless it is made ownerless also with respect to the rich, as in the year of release (shmittah). If all the sheaves of the field were of one kav each and one was of four kavs, and it was forgotten, Beth Shammai says: it does not count as forgotten, And Beth Hillel says: it counts as forgotten.","2204":"A sheaf which was close to a wall or to a stack or to the herd or to field utensils, and was forgotten, Beth Shammai says: it does not count as forgotten, And Beth Hillel says: it counts as forgotten.","2205":"A vineyard of the fourth year     Beth Shammai says: it is not subject to the law of the fifth nor to the law of removal. And Beth Hillel says: it is subject to the law of the fifth and to the law of removal. Beth Shammai says: it is subject to the law of fallen grapes and to the law of gleanings,   and the poor redeem them for themselves. And Beth Hillel says: all of it goes to the winepress.","2206":"A barrel of pickled olives:  Beth Shammai says: one need not perforate it, And Beth Hillel say: one must perforate it. But they agree that if it was perforated and the dregs stopped it up, it is not liable to receive impurity. One who had anointed himself with clean oil and then became unclean, and he went down and immersed himself, Beth Shammai says: although he still drips oil, it is clean. And Beth Hillel says: only while there remains enough for anointing a small limb. And if from the beginning it was unclean oil, Beth Shammai says: it is unclean as long as there remains enough for anointing a small limb, And Beth Hillel says: even if there remains as much as a moist liquid. Rabbi Judah says in the name of Beth Hillel: provided it remains moist itself and can also moisten other things.","2207":"A woman is betrothed by a denar or the value of a denar, according to the opinion of Beth Shammai. But Beth Hillel says: by a perutah or the value of a perutah. And how much is a perutah? One-eighth of an Italian issar. Beth Shammai says:  one may dismiss his wife with an old bill of divorcement, But Beth Hillel forbids it. What is an old bill of divorcement? Whenever he was secluded with her after he has written it for her. One who divorces his wife and she afterwards spends a night with him at the same inn: Beth Shammai says: she does not require a second bill of divorcement from him. But Beth Hillel says: she requires a second bill of divorcement from him. When does she require a second bill of divorcement? When she was divorced after marriage. But if she was divorced after betrothal she does not require from him a second bill of divorcement, since he is not yet familiar with her.","2208":"Beth Shammai permits the rival wives of a deceased brother to be married  to the surviving brothers; But Beth Hillel forbids them. If they have performed halitzah, Beth Shammai pronounce them unfit to marry into the priesthood, But Beth Hillel pronounced them fit. If they have married their brother-in-law, Beth Shammai pronounce them fit to marry into the priesthood, But Beth Hillel pronounced them unfit. And although these pronounce unfit and these pronounce fit, Beth Shammai did not refrain from marrying women from the daughters of Beth Hillel, nor did Beth Hillel refrain from marrying women from the daughters of Beth Shammai. And in the case of all matters of purity and impurity in respect to which these pronounce pure and these pronounce impure, they did not refrain from preparing foods requiring a condition of purity each by means of the vessels of the other.","2209":"In the case of three brothers, of whom two were married to two sisters and one was unmarried, if one of the husbands of the sisters died and the unmarried one betrothed her (maamar), and afterwards his other brother died, Beth Shammai says: his wife remains with him, and the other widow is released on the grounds of the law forbidding the wife\u2019s sister. But Beth Hillel says: he should put away his wife with a get and halitzah, and the wife of his brother he should put away with halitzah. This is the case of which they said: woe to him because of his wife, and woe to him because of his brother\u2019s wife!","2210":"One who takes a vow not to have intercourse with his wife:  Beth Shammai says: after two weeks he must divorce her and pay her kethubah, And Beth Hillel say: after one week. A woman  has a miscarriage on the eve of the eighty first day:  Beth Shammai exempt her from bringing the offering, And Beth Hillel do not exempt her. With regards to the rules of tzitzit on linen sheet: Beth Shammai exempts, And Beth Hillel does not exempt. A basket of fruit set aside for the Sabbath:  Beth Shammai exempts it from tithes. And Beth Hillel does not exempt it.","2211":"One who vowed to keep a longer naziriteship than ordinary and he completed his naziriteship and afterwards came to the holy land: Beth Shammai says: he must be a nazirite only thirty days, But Beth Hillel says: he must be a nazirite the full time vowed as in the beginning. One who has two groups of witnesses who testify about him, these testifying that he vowed two naziriteships and these testifying that he vowed five: Beth Shammai says: their testimony is divided, and there is no obligation to perform naziriteship. But Beth Hillel says: within the five, two are included, so that he must be a nazirite twice.","2212":"A man who was set beneath the gap: Beth Shammai says: he does not cause the impurity to pass over. But Beth Hillel says: a man is hollow, and the upper side causes the impurity to pass over.","2213":"Rabbi Judah says:  there are six instances of lenient rulings by Beth Shammai and stringent rulings by Beth Hillel.The blood of a carcass: Beth Shammai pronounces it clean, And Beth Hillel pronounces it unclean. An egg found in a bird\u2019s carcass: if the like of it were sold in the market, it is permitted, and if not, it is forbidden, according to the opinion of Beth Shammai. And Beth Hillel forbids it. But they agree in the case of an egg found in a trefa  bird that it is forbidden since it had its growth in a forbidden condition. 3+4) The blood of a non-Jewish woman and the blood of purity of a leprous woman: Beth Shammai pronounces clean; And Beth Hillel says: it is like her spittle and her urine. One may eat fruits of the seventh year with an expression of thanks and without an expression of thanks to the owner of the field, according to the opinion of Beth Shammai. But Beth Hillel says: one may not eat with an expression of thanks. Beth Shammai says: a waterskin is liable to become impure only if it is tied up and remains unimpaired. And the school of Hillel says: even if it is not tied up.","2214":"Rabbi Yose says:  there are six instances of lenient rulings by Beth Shammai and stringent rulings by Beth Hillel.A fowl may be put on a table together with cheese but may not be eaten with it, according to the opinion of Beth Shammai. But Beth Hillel says: it may neither be put on the table together with it nor eaten with it. Olives may be given as terumah for oil and grapes for wine, according to the opinion of Beth Shammai. But Beth Hillel says: they may not be given. One who sows seed within four cubits of a vineyard: Beth Shammai says: he has caused one row of vines to be prohibited. But Beth Hillel says: he has caused two rows to be prohibited. Flour paste flour that had been mixed with boiling water: Beth Shammai exempts from the law of hallah; But Beth Hillel pronounces it liable. One may immerse oneself in a rain-torrent, according to the opinion of Beth Shammai; But Beth Hillel say: one may not immerse oneself therein. One who became a proselyte on the eve of Passover: Beth Shammai says: he may immerse himself and eat his Passover sacrifice in the evening. But Beth Hillel says: one who separates himself from uncircumcision is as one who separates himself from the grave.","2215":"Rabbi Yishmael says:  there are three instances of lenient rulings by Beth Shammai and strict rulings by Beth Hillel.The book of Ecclesiastes does not defile the hands, according to the opinion of Beth Shammai; But Beth Hillel say: it defiles the hands. Water of purification which has done its duty: Beth Shammai pronounces it pure, But Beth Hillel pronounces it impure. Black cumin: Beth Shammai pronounces it not liable to become impure, But Beth Hillel pronounces it liable to become impure. So, too, with regard to tithes.","2216":"Rabbi Eliezer says:  there are two instances of lenient rulings by Beth Shammai and strict rulings by Beth Hillel.The blood of a woman after childbirth who has not immersed herself, Beth Shammai says: it is like her spittle and her urine. But Beth Hillel says: it causes impurity whether wet or dry. However, they agree in the case of the blood of a woman who gave birth when she had non-menstrual discharge, that it causes defilement whether wet or dry.","2217":"In the case of four brothers of whom two were married to two sisters, if those married to the sisters died, behold, these should perform halitzah and not enter into levirate marriage (with the brothers-in-law). If they went ahead and married them, they must put them away (divorce them). Rabbi Eliezer says in the name of Beth Shammai: they may keep them. But Beth Hillel say: they must put them away.","2218":"Akavia ben Mahalalel testified concerning four things. They said to him: Akavia, retract these four things which you say, and we will make you the head of the court in Israel. He said to them: it is better for me to be called a fool all my days than that I should become even for one hour a wicked man before God; So they shouldn\u2019t say: \u201che withdrew his opinions for the sake of power.\u201d He used to pronounce impure the hair which has been left over in leprosy, And green blood (of vaginal discharge); But the Sages declared them clean. He used to permit the wool of a first-born animal which was blemished and which had fallen out and had been put in a niche, the first-born being slaughtered afterwards; But the sages forbid it. He used to say: a woman proselyte and a freed slave-woman are not made to drink of the bitter waters. But the Sages say: they are made to drink. They said to him: it happened in the case of Karkemith, a freed slave-woman who was in Jerusalem, that Shemaiah and Avtalion made her drink. He said to them: they made her drink an example (and not the real water). Whereupon they excommunicated him; and he died while he was under excommunication, and the court stoned his coffin. Rabbi Judah said: God forbid that one should say that Akavia was excommunicated; for the courtyard is never locked for any man in Israel who was equal to Avavia ben Mahalalel in wisdom and the fear of sin. But whom did they excommunicate?  Eliezer the son of Hanoch who cast doubt against the laws concerning the purifying of the hands. And when he died the court sent and laid a stone on his coffin. This teaches that whoever is excommunicated and dies while under excommunication, his coffin is stoned.","2219":"At the time of his death he said to his son, \u201cRetract the four opinions which I used to declare.\u201d He (the said to him, \u201cWhy did not you retract them?\u201d He said to him, \u201cI heard them from the mouth of the many, and they heard the contrary from the mouth of the many.

They said to him: is not there an inference from the minor to the major (kal vehomer):   If in the case of a living man who is himself pure a limb severed from him is impure, how much more in the case of a corpse which is itself impure should a limb severed from it be impure! He said to them: they have nevertheless declared it only of a limb from a living man. Another answer:  The impurity of living men is greater than the impurity of corpses, because a living man causes that on which he lies and sits to become capable of making impure a man and clothing, and he causes also what is over him to transfer impurity to foods and liquids- which is defilement that a corpse does not cause.","2222":"An olive's size of flesh that separated from the limb of a living person: Rabbi Eliezer declares impure, and Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Nechunya declare pure. A barley-grain's size of bone that separates from a limb of a living person: Rabbi Nechunya declares impure, and Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua declare pure. They said to Rabbi Eliezer: Why did you see fit to declare an olive's worth of flesh that separated from the limb of a living person impure? He said to them: We find that the limb of a living person is like a complete dead person. Just like an olive's size of flesh that separates from a dead person is impure, so too an olive's size of flesh that separated from the limb of a living person is impure. They said to him: No. If you say that an olive's size of flesh that separated from a dead person is impure, as is a barley-grain's size of bone that separates from a dead person, how will you also declare an olive's size of flesh that separated from the limb of a living person impure when you declare pure a barley-grain's size of bone that separates from the limb of a living person? You yourself do not appear to judge these cases as parallel to each other, so how can you claim that to be your reasoning? They said to Rabbi Nechunya: Why did you see fit to declare a barley-grain's size of bone that separated from the limb of a living person impure? He said to them: We find that the limb of a living person is like a complete dead person. Just like a barley-grain's worth of flesh that separates from a dead person is impure, so too a barley-grain's worth of bone that separated from the limb of a living person is impure. They said to him: No. If you say that a barley-grain's worth of bone that separated from a dead person is impure, as is an olive's size of flesh that separates from a dead person, how will you also declare a barley-grain's size of bone that separated from the limb of a living person impure when you declare pure an olive's worth of flesh that separates from a living person? You yourself do not appear to judge these cases as parallel to each other, so how can you claim that to be your reasoning? They said to Rabbi Eliezer: Why did you see fit to divide your method and be inconsistent in your reasoning? Either they are both pure, or they are both impure! He said to them: There are more chances for flesh to become impure than there are chances for bones to become impure, for flesh applies to carcasses and insects, which is not so for bones. Another answer: A limb that has enough flesh on it that were it still attached to a human being, it would be viable imparts impurity by touching, carrying, and being under its same roof-space. If one diminishes the flesh of the limb, it remains impure. If one diminishes the bone of the limb, it becomes pure. They said to Rabbi Nechunya: Why did you see fit to divide your method and be inconsistent in your reasoning? Either they are both pure, or they are both impure! He said to them: There are more chances for bones to become impure than there are chances for flesh to become impure, for flesh separated from a living man is pure, but a limb that is separated from a living man, and it is full with flesh, bone, and sinews, it is impure. Another answer: An olive's worth of flesh severed from a corpse imparts impurity by touching, carrying, and being under its roof-space, and bones create a majority in making impure by touching, carrying, and being under its same roof-space, and a majority of a corpse's bones impart impurity by touching, carrying, and being under their same roof-space. If one diminishes the flesh that has been severed from a corpse, it becomes pure. If one diminishes the majority of bone, even though they now become pure and can no longer impart impurity on whatever is under their same roof-space, they still impart impurity by touching and carrying. Another answer: Any flesh of a dead person which is less than an olive's worth is pure. But bones that makes up the majority of a dead person's build or constitute a majority of his bone count, even if they are only a quarter <i>kav<\/i> (a measure), they are impure. They said to Rabbi Yehoshua: Why did you see fit to declare both bone and flesh from a dead person pure? Is not Rabbi Nechunya's reasoning correct? He said to them: No. If you say about a corpse that it is impure, it is because of the laws of majority, quarter <i>kav<\/i>, and decay that apply to it, but how can you also say about a living person that he is impure, if he does not have the laws of majority, quarter <i>kav<\/i>, and decay apply to him? You cannot compare that which was separated from a corpse with that which was separated from the limb of a living person, because the limbs severed from a living person are less likely to impart impurity than the corpse.","2223":"Rabbi  Joshua and Rabbi Zadok testified concerning the redemption of a firstborn donkey, that if it died, the priest receives nothing, Whereas Rabbi Eliezer says: the owner must bear the responsibility as with the five selas in the case of a firstborn son.

But the Sages say:  \u201cAnyone who makes restitution is not flogged.\u201d","2261":"If they say:  \u201cWe testify that so and so is liable to a flogging of forty lashes, and they are found to be perjurers, they receive eighty lashes, because of, \u201cYou shall not bear false witness against your neighbor\u201d and \u201cYou shall do to him as he schemed to do to his fellow\u201d (Deuternomy 19:19), these are the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say, \u201cThey receive only forty lashes.\u201d Monetary impositions are shared among the offenders, but the lashes are not shared among the offenders. How so? If they testified that he owed his friend two hundred zuz, and they were found to be perjurers, they divide the corresponding damages proportionately between them.

But, if these other witnesses said:  \u201cHow could you testify to that, as on that very day, you were with us at such and such a place?\u2019 then the former are condemned as perjurers, and are executed by their the other witnesses word.","2263":"If other witnesses came, and they charged them with perjury: then again others came, and they again charged them with perjury, even a hundred, they are all to be executed. Rabbi Judah says:  \u201cThis is a conspiracy and the first set alone is to be executed.\u201d","2264":"Perjuring witnesses are not to be put to death until after the end of the trial. Because the Sadducees say:  \u201cPerjurers were put to death only after the accused had actually been executed, as it says, \u201c A life for a life\u201d  which implies when his brother is still alive? If so, why does it say \u201cA life for life\u201d? For it might have been that perjurers are liable to be put to death from the moment their testimony had been taken, therefore the Torah states \u201cA life for a life\u201d that is to say that they are not executed until after the termination of the trial.","2265":"\u201cA person shall be put to death only on the testimony of two witnesses or three witnesses\u201d (Deuteronomy 17:6).If the testimony is sufficiently established by two witnesses, why does Scripture further specify three? This is to compare two to three: just as three are competent to incriminate two as perjurers, so are two competent to incriminate three as perjurers. How do we know that two or three can even incriminate a hundred?  The Torah states \u201cwitnesses\u201d. Rabbi Shimon says: \u201cJust as two witnesses are not put to death until both have been incriminated as perjurers, so three are not put to death until all three have been incriminated as perjurers. How do we know that two or three can even incriminate a hundred?  The Torah states \u201cwitnesses\u201d. Rabbi Akiba says:  \u201cThe third witness was only mentioned in order to be stringent upon him and make his judgement the same as the other two. And if Scripture thus penalizes one who consorts with those who commit a transgression, as if he is actually one of those who commits the transgression, how much more so shall he who consorts with those who perform commandments receive a reward as if he is actually one of those who performs the commandments!\u201d","2266":"Just as in the case of two witnesses, if one of them was found to be a relative or otherwise disqualified, their whole evidence is rendered void, so it is with three, if one of them was found to be a relative or otherwise disqualified, the whole evidence is void. How do we know that this is the case even with a hundred?  The Torah states \u201cwitnesses\u201d. Rabbi Yose said:  \u201cWhen is this true?  With regards to capital cases;  but in monetary suits, the evidence may be established by the rest. Rabbis says:  \u201cIt is one and the same rule, be it in monetary suits or capital cases.\u201d This is the rule when both disqualified witnesses warned the trasngressor, but when they did not warn him, what could two brothers do that saw someone killing a person?","2267":"If two persons see him the transgressor from one window and two other persons see him from another window and one standing in the middle warns him, then, if some on one side and some on the other side can see one another,  they constitute together one body of evidence, but if they cannot see one another, they are two bodies of evidence. Consequently, if one of these is found to be a perjurer, both the transgressor and those two witnesses are put to death, while other group of witnesses is exempt. Rabbi Yose says:  \u201cHe is never put to death unless two witnesses had warned him, as it says, \u201cby the mouth of two witnesses..\u201d (Deut. 17:6). Another interpretation:  \u201cBy the mouth of two witnesses\u201d:  that the Sanhedrin shall not hear the evidence from the mouth of an interpreter.","2268":"If one fled after having been convicted at a court and again comes up before the same court, the first judgment is not set aside. Wherever two witnesses stand up and declare, \u201cWe testify that so and so was tried and convicted at a certain court and that so and so were the witnesses\u201d the accused is executed. Trials before a sanhedrin are customary both in the land of Israel and outside it. A sanhedrin that executes once in seven years, is called murderous. Rabbi Eliezer b. Azariah Says: once in seventy years. Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva say:  \u201cHad we been members of a sanhedrin, no person would ever be put to death. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel remarked:  \u201cThey would also multiply murderers in Israel.\u201d","2269":"The following go into banishment: one who kills in error. If for instance while he was pushing a roller on the roof and it fell down and killed somebody; If while he was lowering a cask it fell down and killed somebody; If while coming down a ladder he fell on somebody and killed him, he goes into banishment. But, if while he was pulling up the roller it fell back and killed somebody; If while he was raising a cask and the rope snapped and the cask fell and killed somebody; If while going up a ladder he fell down and killed somebody, he does not go into banishment. This is the general principle: whenever the death was caused in the course of a downward movement, he goes into banishment, but if it was caused not in the course of a downward movement, he does not go into banishment. If the iron slipped from its heft and killed somebody: Rabbi says, \u201cHe does not go into banishment.\u201d And the Sages say:  \u201cHe goes into banishment.\u201d If it flew from the log being split: Rabbi says, \u201cHe goes into banishment.\u201d And the Sages say:  \u201cHe does not go into banishment.\u201d","2270":"If a man threw a stone into the public domain and killed a person, he goes into banishment. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says:  \u201cIf after the stone had left his hand another person put out his head and caught it, the thrower is exempt from banishment.\u201d If a man threw a stone into his own court and killed a person, then, if the victim had a right of entry there, the thrower goes into banishment, and if not, he does not go into banishment, as it says, \u201cAs when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor\u201d (Deut. 19:5): the forest is a domain accessible to the victim and to the slayer and it therefore excludes the court of the householder where the victim has no right of entry. Abba Shaul says: \u201cHewing of wood is an optional act and it therefore excludes a father beating his son, or a master disciplining his pupil, or an agent of the court administering lashes.\u201d","2271":"The father goes into banishment for the death of his son, and the son goes into banishment for that of his father. All go into banishment for the death of an Israelite, and Israelites go into banishment on their account, except for a resident alien. And a resident alien does not go into banishment except for the death of another resident alien. A blind person does not go into banishment, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir says:  \u201cHe goes into banishment.\u201d An enemy does not go into banishment. Rabbi Yose bar Judah says:  \u201cAn enemy is executed, for it is as if he has been warned.\u201d Rabbi Shimon says:  \u201cThere is an enemy that goes into banishment and there is an enemy that does not go into banishment:  wherever it can be said that he had killed his victim wittingly, he goes not into banishment,  and where he had slain unwittingly, he goes into banishment.","2272":"To where are they banished? To the cities of refuge, to the three cities situated on the far side of the Jordan and the three cities situated in Canaan, as it says, \u201cThree cities shall be designated beyond the Jordan, and the other three shall be designated in the land of Canaan\u201d (Numbers 35:14). Not until three cities were selected in the land of Israel did the first three cities beyond the jordan receive fugitives, as it says, \u201cSix cities of refuge in all\u201d (Numbers 35:13), until all six could simultaneously receive fugitives.","2273":"And direct roads were made leading from one to the other, as it says, \u201cYou shall prepare the way and divide the borders of your land into three parts\u201d (Deut. 19:3). And they delegate to him two disciples of the Sages as escorts in case anyone attempted to slay him on the way, and that they might speak to him. Rabbi Meir says:  \u201cHe may even plead his cause himself, as it says, \u201cAnd this is the word of the manslayer\u201d (Deut. 19:4).","2274":"Rabbi Yose bar Judah says:  \u201cInitially a slayer is sent in advance to one of the cities of refuge, whether he had slain in error or with intent and then the court sends and brings him out. Whoever was found guilty of a capital crime the court had executed, and whoever was found not guilty of a capital crime they acquitted. Whoever was found liable to banishment they restored to his place of refuge as it says, \u201cAnd the congregation shall restore him to the city of refuge to which he fled\u201d (Numbers 35:25). All the same are the deaths of the high priest who had been anointed with the anointing oil; or had worn many garments, or had retired from his office all make possible the return of the manslayer. Rabbi Judah says also the death of the priest who had been anointed for war makes possible the return of the manslayer. Therefore, mothers of high priests would provide food and clothing for them who had been exiled that they might not pray for their son\u2019s death. If the high priest died at the conclusion of the trial, the slayer does not go into banishment. If he died before the trial was concluded and another high priest was appointed in his stead and the trial was then concluded, the slayer returns home from refuge only after the latter\u2019s death.","2275":"If the trial was concluded when there was no high priest in office, or if one kills a high priest, or a high priest that kills, in these cases the manslayer can never come away from that place of refuge. He the manslayer may not go out to bear witness, neither for cases having to do with a religious observance, nor to bear witness in a monetary suit, nor to bear witness in a capital case. Even should all Israel need him, and even a general like Yoav the son of Zeruiah, he may never go out, as it is said, \u201cto there he fled\u201d:  \u2018there\u2019 must be his abode, \u2018there\u2019 his death, \u2018there\u2019 his burial. Just as the city affords asylum so does its Sabbath boundary afford asylum. If a manslayer went beyond the boundary of the city and the blood avenger found him: Rabbi Yose the Galilean says:  \u201cFor the avenger it is a matter of obligation to kill him; for everyone else, a matter of option.\u201d Rabbi Akiba says: \u201cIt is a matter of option for the avenger, and anyone else who kills him is not liable for doing so.\u201d If a tree was standing within the boundary and its boughs extended beyond the boundary or if it was standing outside of the boundary and its boughs extended within, it wholly follows the position of the boughs. If he slew someone in that city of refuge he is banished from one neighborhood to another neighborhood. And a Levite is banished from one city to another.","2276":"A manslayer who went to his city of his refuge and the men of that city wished to do him honor, should refuse by saying to them, \u201cI am a manslayer!\u201d. If they say to him, \u201cNevertheless\u201d he should accept from them the proffered honor, as it is said: \u201cand this is the word of the manslayer.\u201d They used to pay  rent to the Levites, according to the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir says: \u201cThey did not pay them rent.\u201d And on his return home he returns to the office he formerly held, according to the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: \u201cHe does not return to the office he formerly held.\u201d","2277":"And these are liable to be flogged:One who had relations with his sister, or his father's sister, or his mother's sister, or his wife's sister, or his brother's wife, or his father's brother's wife, or a menstruant; A high priest who marries a widow,  an ordinary priest who marries a divorcee  or a halutzah; An Israelite who marries a mamzereth or natinah,  or an Israelite woman who is married to a mamzer  or a  natin.

If they estimated him capable of receiving forty, and after receiving some they said he cannot receive forty, he is exempt from the rest.

If he committed a transgression which violated two prohibitions and they made one estimate for the lashes for both prohibitions,  he is lashed and then exempt from more.

He lashes him not in a standing or sitting position but stooping, as it says, \u201cAnd the judge shall cause him to fall stoop down\u201d (Deut. 25:2). He who administers the lashes lashes with his one hand and with his whole force.","2290":"And the one who recites, says: \u201cIf you fail to observe faithfully all the terms of this Teaching\u2026the Lord will inflict upon you extraordinary plagues And then he returns to the beginning of the section. \u201cTherefore observe faithfully all the terms of this covenant\u201d and he completes by saying, \u201cAnd He is merciful, forgiving iniquity\u201d (Psalms 78:38). If the offender dies under his hand, he is exempt from penalty. If he gave him one more lash and the offender died, he goes into banishment. If the offender befouled himself either with feces or urine, he is exempt. Rabbi Judah says: \u201cFeces in the case of a man and even urine in the case of a woman.","2291":"All who have incurred the penalty of kareth, on being flogged are exempt from their punishment of kareth, for it says, \u201cHe may be given up to forty lashes, but not more ... lest your brother shall be dishonored before your eyes\u201d once he has been lashed he is considered \u201cyour brother\u201d, the words of Rabbi Hananiah ben Gamaliel. Rabbi Hananiah ben Gamaliel said:  \u201cJust as one who transgresses one transgression forfeits his life, how much more does one who performs one commandment have his life granted him.\u201d Rabbi Shimon says: \u201cYou can learn this from its own passage;  as it says: \u201cAll who do any of those abhorrent things such persons shall be cut off from their people\u201d (Lev. 18:29), and it says:  \u201cYou shall keep my statutes and my ordinances which if a man do, he shall live by them\u201d (Lev. 18:5), which means that one who desists from transgressing is granted reward like one who performs a precept. Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi says:  Behold the Torah says, \u201cBut makes sure that you do not partake of the blood; for the blood is the life, and you must not consume the life with the flesh\u2026that it may go well with you and with your descendents to come..\u201d (Deut. 12:23-25\u201d--  now, if in the case of blood which a person\u2019s soul loathes, anyone who refrains from it receives reward, how much more so in regard to robbery and sexual sin for which a person\u2019s soul craves and longs shall one who refrains from them acquire merit for himself and for generations and generations to come, to the end of all generations!","2292":"Rabbi Hananiah ben Akashia says: \u201cThe Holy Blessed One, desired to make Israel worthy, therefore He gave them much Torah to study and many commandments to perform: for it is says, \u201cThe Lord desires his servant\u2019s vindication, that he may magnify and glorify His teaching\u201d (Isaiah 42).","2293":"Cases concerning <b>monetary law<\/b> are adjudicated <b>by three<\/b> judges.

That is to say, each member of the Sanhedrin can be viewed as a judge with responsibility for ten residents. If there are not enough men in the city to enable this calculation, it would not be honorable to appoint a Sanhedrin, as their members will each preside over less than the minimum of ten residents.","2299":"The <b>High Priest judges<\/b> others if he is sufficiently wise, <b>and<\/b> others <b>judge him<\/b> when he transgresses.

If a relative <b>of<\/b> the High Priest <b>dies, he does not follow the bier<\/b> carrying the corpse, since it is prohibited for the High Priest to become ritually impure even for immediate relatives (see Leviticus 21:11). <b>Rather,<\/b> once the members of the funeral procession <b>are concealed<\/b> from sight by turning onto another street, <b>he is revealed<\/b> on the street they departed, and when <b>they are revealed,<\/b> then <b>he is concealed, and<\/b> in this way, <b>he goes out with them until the entrance of the gate of the city,<\/b> from where they would take out the corpse, since the dead were not buried in Jerusalem.

They would bring<\/b> the witnesses <b>in and intimidate them<\/b> by saying to them: <b>Perhaps<\/b> what <b>you say<\/b> in your testimony is <b>based on conjecture, or<\/b> perhaps it is <b>based on a rumor,<\/b> perhaps it is <b>testimony<\/b> based on <b>hearsay,<\/b> e.g., you heard a witness testify to this in a different court, <b>or<\/b> perhaps it is <b>based on the statement of a trusted person.

The court tells them: <b>You should know that<\/b> cases of <b>capital law<\/b> are <b>not like<\/b> cases of <b>monetary law.<\/b> In cases of <b>monetary law, a person<\/b> who testifies falsely, causing money to be given to the wrong party, can <b>give<\/b> the <b>money<\/b> to the proper owner <b>and his<\/b> sin <b>is atoned<\/b> for. In cases of <b>capital law,<\/b> if one testifies falsely, <b>the blood of<\/b> the accused <b>and the blood of his offspring<\/b> that he did not merit to produce <b>are ascribed to<\/b> the witness\u2019s testimony <b>until eternity.<\/b> The proof for this is <b>as we found with Cain, who killed his brother, as it is stated<\/b> concerning him: \u201cThe voice of <b>your brother\u2019s blood <i>demei<\/i> cries<\/b> out to Me from the ground\u201d (Genesis 4:10). The verse <b>does not state: Your brother\u2019s blood <i>dam<\/i>,<\/b> in the singular, <b>but<\/b> rather: <b>\u201cYour brother\u2019s blood <i>demei<\/i>,\u201d<\/b> in the plural. This serves to teach that the loss of both <b>his<\/b> brother\u2019s <b>blood and the blood of his<\/b> brother\u2019s <b>offspring<\/b> are ascribed to Cain. The mishna notes: <b>Alternatively,<\/b> the phrase <b>\u201cyour brother\u2019s blood <i>demei<\/i>,\u201d<\/b> written in the plural, teaches that <b>that his blood<\/b> was not gathered in one place but was <b>splattered on the trees and on the stones.<\/b> The court tells the witnesses: <b>Therefore, Adam<\/b> the first man <b>was created alone, to teach you that<\/b> with regard to <b>anyone who destroys one soul from the Jewish people,<\/b> i.e., kills one Jew, <b>the verse ascribes him<\/b> blame <b>as if he destroyed an entire world,<\/b> as Adam was one person, from whom the population of an entire world came forth. <b>And<\/b> conversely, <b>anyone who sustains one soul from the Jewish people, the verse ascribes him<\/b> credit <b>as if he sustained an entire world.<\/b> The mishna cites another reason Adam the first man was created alone: <b>And<\/b> this was done <b>due to<\/b> the importance of maintaining <b>peace among people, so<\/b> that one <b>person will not say to another: My father,<\/b> i.e., progenitor, <b>is greater than your father. And<\/b> it was also <b>so that the heretics<\/b> who believe in multiple gods <b>will not say: There are many authorities in Heaven,<\/b> and each created a different person. <b>And<\/b> this serves <b>to tell of the greatness of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as<\/b> when <b>a person stamps several coins with one seal, they are all similar to each other. But the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He, stamped all people with the seal of Adam the first<\/b> man, as all of them are his offspring, <b>and not one of them is similar to another. Therefore,<\/b> since all humanity descends from one person, <b>each and every person is obligated to say: The world was created for me,<\/b> as one person can be the source of all humanity, and recognize the significance of his actions. The court says to the witnesses: <b>And perhaps you will say:<\/b> <b>Why would we<\/b> want <b>this trouble?<\/b> Perhaps it would be better not to testify at all. <b>But<\/b> be aware, as <b>is it not already stated: \u201cAnd he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he does not utter it,<\/b> then he shall bear his iniquity\u201d (Leviticus 5:1)? It is a transgression not to testify when one can do so. <b>And perhaps you will say: Why would we<\/b> want <b>to be responsible for the blood of this<\/b> person? <b>But<\/b> be aware, as <b>is it not already stated: \u201cWhen the wicked perish, there is song\u201d<\/b> (Proverbs 11:10)?","2317":"The court <b>would examine<\/b> the witnesses in capital cases <b>with seven interrogations,<\/b> i.e., interrogatory questions, and they are: <b>In which seven-year<\/b> period, that is, in which cycle of seven years within a jubilee did the event occur; <b>in which year<\/b> of the Sabbatical cycle did the event occur; <b>in which month<\/b> did the event occur; <b>on which<\/b> day <b>of the month<\/b> did the event occur; <b>on which day<\/b> of the week did the event occur; <b>at which hour<\/b> did the event occur; and <b>in what place<\/b> did the event occur. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:<\/b> The court would examine the witnesses with only three interrogations: <b>On which day<\/b> did the event occur, <b>at which hour,<\/b> and <b>in what place.<\/b> They would also ask: <b>Do you recognize him<\/b> as the man who committed the transgression? <b>Did you warn him?<\/b> They would then ask the witnesses about the particulars of the incident. For example, in the case of <b>one who<\/b> is an accused <b>idol worshipper,<\/b> they ask the witnesses: <b>Whom,<\/b> i.e., which idol, <b>did he worship, and in what manner did he worship<\/b> it, and so on.","2318":"With regard to <b>all<\/b> judges <b>who increase<\/b> the number of <b>examinations,<\/b> i.e., who add questions about the details of the event, <b>this is praiseworthy,<\/b> as this may clarify that the witnesses are lying. <b>An incident<\/b> occurred <b>and ben Zakkai examined<\/b> the witnesses by questioning them <b>about<\/b> the color and shape of <b>the stems of figs<\/b> in order to unearth a contradiction between the witnesses.

Similarly, if <b>one<\/b> witness <b>says<\/b> that the event occurred <b>at two hours,<\/b> i.e., the second hour of the day from sunrise, <b>and one<\/b> witness <b>says<\/b> that the event occurred <b>at three hours, their testimony stands,<\/b> as one could reasonably err this amount in estimating the hour of the day.

And if he was left<\/b> hanging <b>overnight, a prohibition is transgressed, as it is stated: \u201cHis body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but you shall bury him<\/b> that day, <b>for he that is hung is a curse of God\u201d<\/b> (Deuteronomy 21:23). <b>That is to say:<\/b> Were the corpse left hanging on the tree overnight, people would ask: <b>For what<\/b> reason <b>was this one hung<\/b> after he was put to death? They would be answered: <b>Because he blessed God,<\/b> a euphemism for blasphemy. <b>And therefore the name of Heaven would be desecrated<\/b> were the dead man\u2019s corpse to remain hanging, reminding everybody of his transgression.","2326":"<b>Rabbi Meir said:<\/b> The phrase \u201cfor he that is hung is a curse <i>kilelat<\/i> of God\u201d should be understood as follows: <b>When a man suffers<\/b> in the wake of his sin, <b>what expression does the Divine Presence use?

For other transgressions of the Torah, light and grave, intentional and unintentional, known and unknown, positive and negative, those punishable by kareth and those punishable by death imposed by the court   for all these the scapegoat sent out on the Day of Atonement brings atonement.","2370":"The scapegoat brings atonement to Israelites, priests, and the anointed high priest alike. What then is the difference between Israelites, priests, and the anointed high priest? None, save that the bullock offered on the Day of Atonement brings atonement to the priests for transgressions of the laws of impurity in connection with the temple and holy food. Rabbi Shimon says:  \u201cJust as the blood of the goat that is offered within the Holy of Holies brings atonement for Israelites, so the blood of the bullock offered on the Day of Atonement brings atonement for priests; and just as the confession of sins pronounced over the scapegoat brings atonement for Israelites, so the confession pronounced over the bullock brings atonement for priests.","2371":"The laws concerning the discovery of having contracted uncleanness are of two kinds, subdivided into four;If he became impure and was aware of it, then he forgot that he had been impure, though he remembered that the food was holy; If the fact that it was holy food was unknown to him, though he remembered that he was impure; If both were unknown to him; And he ate holy food, and was not aware, and after he had eaten, he became aware:   in these cases he brings a sliding scale sacrifice. If he became impure and was aware of it, then he forgot that he had been impure, though he remembered that he was entering the Temple; If the fact that he was entering the Temple was unknown to him, though he remembered that he was impure; If both were hidden from him; And he entered the Temple and was not aware, and after he had gone out, became aware:   in these cases he brings a sliding scale sacrifice.","2372":"It is the same whether one while impure enters the Temple court or the addition to the Temple court, for additions are not made to the city of Jerusalem, or to the Temple courts except by the king, prophet, Urim and Thummim, the Sanhedrin of seventy one, and with two loaves of thanksgiving, and with song. And the court walks in a procession, the two loaves of thanksgiving being carried after them, and all Israel following behind them. The inner one is eaten, and the outer one is burnt. And as to any addition that was made without all these   he who enters it while impure is not liable.","2373":"If he became impure while in the Temple court and was aware of it, and then forgot that he was impure, though he remembered that he was in the Temple; Or he forgot that he was in the Temple, though he remembered that he was impure; Or, he forgot both; And he prostrated himself, or waited in the Temple the time it takes to prostrate; Or went out the long way, he is liable; If he went out the shorter way, he is not liable; This is the positive precept concerning the temple for which they the court are not liable.","2374":"And which is the positive precept concerning a menstruant for which they are liable? This: if one cohabited with a ritually pure woman, and she said to him:  \u201cI have become impure\u201d, and he withdrew immediately, he is liable, because his withdrawal is as pleasant to him as his entry.","2375":"Rabbi Eliezer said:  \u201cScripture says: \u2018If any one touch\u2026 the carcass of an impure creeping thing, and it be unknown to him\u2019 (Leviticus 5:2), when the impure creeping thing is unknown to him, he is liable; but he is not liable, when the fact that he is in the Temple is unknown to him.\u201d Rabbi Akiba said:  \u201cScripture says: \u2018and it be hidden from him that he is impure\u2019:   when his impurity is unknown to him, he is liable; but he is not liable, when the fact that he is in the Temple is unknown to him.\u201d Rabbi Ishmael said:  \u201cScripture twice says: \u2018and it be hidden from him\u2019, in order to make him liable both for the forgetfulness of the impurity and the forgetfulness of the Temple.\u201d","2376":"Oaths are two, subdivided into four. \u201cI swear I shall eat\u201d, and \u201cI swear I shall not eat\u201d; \u201cI swear I  have eaten\u201d, and \u201cI swear I have not eaten\u201d. \u201cI swear I shall not eat\u201d, and he ate even a minute quantity, he is liable, the words of Rabbi Akiva. They the Sages said to Rabbi Akiva:  \u201cWhere do we find that he who eats a minute quantity is liable, that this one should be liable?\u201d Rabbi Akiba said to them:  \u201cBut where do we find that he who merely speaks brings a sacrifice, that this one should bring a sacrifice?\u201d If a man says, \u201cI swear I shall not eat\u201d and he ate and drank, he is liable only once. \u201cI swear I shall not eat and I shall not drink,\u201d and he ate and drank, he is liable twice.","2377":"\u201cI swear I shall not eat,\u201d and he ate wheat bread, barley bread, and spelt bread, he is liable only once. \u201cI swear I shall not eat wheat bread, barley bread, and spelt bread,\u201d and he ate all three, he is liable for each one.","2378":"\u201cI swear I shall not drink,\u201d and he drank many liquids, he is liable only once. \u201cI swear I shall not drink wine, oil, and honey,\u201d and he drank all three, he is liable for each one.","2379":"\u201cI swear I shall not eat,\u201d and he ate foods which are not fit to be eaten, and drank liquids which are not fit to be drunk, he is exempt. \u201cI swear I shall not eat,\u201d and he ate carrion, trefot, and reptiles and creepy things, he is liable. Rabbi Shimon exempts him. He said, \u201cI vow that my wife shall not benefit from me, if I have eaten today,\u201d and he had eaten carrion, trefot, forbidden animals, or reptiles, his wife is prohibited to him.","2380":"It is the same whether he swears of things concerning himself, or of things concerning others, or of things which have substance, or of things which have no substance. How so? If he said, \u201cI swear that I shall give to so-and-so\u201d,  or \u201cI shall not give\u201d; \u201cI have given\u201d, or \u201cI have not given\u201d; \u201cI shall sleep\u201d, or \u201cI shall not sleep\u201d; \u201cI have slept\u201d, or \u201cI have not slept\u201d; \u201cI shall throw a pebble into the sea\u201d, or \u201cI shall not throw\u201d; \u201cI have thrown\u201d, or \u201cI have not thrown\u201d; he is liable. Rabbi Ishmael says:  \u201cHe is liable only for an oath with regards to the future, for it says,  \u201cTo do bad or to do good\u201d (Leviticus 5:4). Rabbi Akiva said to him:  \u201cIf so, we would know only such cases where doing evil and doing good are applicable; but how do we know such cases where doing evil and doing good are not applicable? He said to him:  \u201cFrom the amplification of the verse.\u201d He said to him: \u201cIf the verse amplifies for that, it amplifies for this also.\u201d","2381":"If he swore to annul a commandment, and did not annul it, he is exempt. If he swore to fulfill a commandment, and did not fulfill it, he is exempt. For it would have been logical in the second instance that he should have been liable, as is the opinion of Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra. For Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra said, \u201cNow, if for swearing with regards to an optional matter, for which he is not adjured from Mount Sinai, he is liable should he not fulfill his oath, for swearing with regards to a commandment, for which he is adjured from Mount Sinai, he should most certainly be liable should he not fulfill his oath! They said to him:  \u201cNo! If you say that for an oath with regards to an optional matter he is liable, it is because Scripture has in that case made negative equal to positive for liability;  But how can you say that for an oath to fulfill a commandment he is liable, since Scripture has not in that case made negative equal to positive, for if he swore to annul a commandment, and did not annul it, he is exempt!","2382":"\u201cI swear I shall not eat this loaf\u201d; \u201cI swear I shall not eat it\u201d; \u201cI swear I shall not eat it\u201d; and he ate it, he is liable only once. This is the oath of utterance, for which one is liable, for its willful transgression, flogging; and for its unwitting transgression, a sliding scale sacrifice. For a vain oath one is liable for willful transgression, flogging, and for unwitting transgression one is exempt.","2383":"What is a vain oath?If he swore that which is contrary to the facts known to people, saying of a pillar of stone that it is of gold; or of a man that he is a woman; or of a woman that she is a man. If he swore concerning a thing which is impossible, for instance if he said, \u201cIf I have not seen a camel flying in the air\u201d,  or \u201cIf I have not seen a serpent as thick as the beam of the olive press\u201d. If he said to witnesses, \u201cCome and bear testimony for me\u201d, and they replied, \u201cWe swear that we will not bear testimony for you\u201d. If he swore to annul a commandment, for example not to make a sukkah,  or not to take a lulav,  or not to put on tefillin. These are vain oaths, for which one is liable, for intentional transgression, lashes, and for unintentional transgression one is exempt.","2384":"If one said: \u201cI swear I shall eat this loaf\u201d; and then he said, \u201cI swear I shall not eat it,\u201d the first is an oath of utterance,  and the second is a vain oath. If he ate it, he transgressed the vain oath; if he did not eat it, he transgressed the oath of utterance.","2385":"The oath of utterance applies to men and women, to relatives and non-relatives, to those qualified to bear witness and those not qualified, whether uttered before the court, or not before the court, but it must be uttered with a man\u2019s own mouth.

In the case of both this and that oath, if he was adjured by the mouth of others, he is liable. How so? If he said, \u201cI have not eaten today,\u201d or, \u201cI have not put on tefillin today\u201d and the another person said, \u201cI adjure thee,\u201d and he said, \u201cAmen!\u201d, he is liable if his oath was false.","2387":"The oath of testimony applies to men and not to women, to non-relatives and not to relatives, to those qualified to bear witness and not to those unqualified.  And it applies only to those eligible to bear witness. Whether uttered in front of the court or not in front of the court, if uttered with his own mouth; but if adjured by the mouth of others he is not liable unless he denies it before the court, these are the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say:  \u201cWhether uttered with his own mouth or adjured by the mouth of others he is not liable unless he denies it before the court.\u201d","2388":"And they are liable for intentional transgression of the oath, and for its unintentional transgression coupled with intentional denial of knowledge of testimony, but they are not liable for unintentional transgression. And what are they liable for the intentional transgression of the oath? A sliding scale sacrifice.","2389":"The oath of testimony:  How is it done? If he said to two persons:  \u201cCome and bear testimony for me\u201d; and they replied:  \u201cWe swear we know no testimony for you\u201d; Or they said to him:  \u201cWe know no testimony for you\u201d, and he said:  \u201cI adjure you\u201d and they said,  \u201cAmen! \u201c, they are liable. If he adjured them five times outside the court, and the they came to the court and admitted knowledge of testimony, they are exempt. If they denied, they are liable for each oath. If he adjured them five times before the court, and they denied knowledge of testimony, they are liable only once. Said Rabbi Shimon: \u201cWhat is the reason?   Because they cannot afterwards admit knowledge.","2390":"If both persons denied knowledge together, they are both liable. If one after another, the first is liable, and the second exempt. If one denied, and the other admitted, the one who denied is liable. If there were two sets of witnesses, and the first denied, and then the second denied, they are both liable, because the testimony could be upheld by either of the two.","2391":"\u201cI adjure you that you come and bear testimony for me that there are of mine in the possession of so-and-so a deposit, a loan, a stolen object, and a lost object\u201d; And they respond:  \u201cWe swear we know no testimony for you\u201d, they are liable only once. \u201cWe swear we know not that there are of yours in the possession of so-and-so a deposit, a loan, a stolen object, and a lost object\u201d, they are liable for each one. \u201cI adjure you that you bear testimony for me that there is of mine in the possession of so-and-so a deposit of wheat, barley, and spelt\u201d; And they respond:  \u201cWe swear we know no testimony for you\u201d, they are liable only once. \u201cWe swear we know no testimony for you that there is of yours in the possession of so-and-so a deposit of wheat, barley, and spelt\u201d, they are liable for each one.","2392":"\u201cI adjure you that you come and bear testimony for me that so-and-so owes me full damages, or half damages, or double payment, or four or five payment; Or that so-and-so raped my daughter, or seduced my daughter; Or that my son struck me; Or that my neighbor injured me, or set fire to my haystack on the Day of Atonement\u201d; And they deny knowledge of testimony they are liable.","2393":"\"I adjure you that you come and bear testimony for me that I am a priest, or, that I am a levite, or, that I am not the son of a divorced woman, or, that I am not the son of a halutzah; That so-and-so is a priest, or, that so-and-so is a levite, or, that he is not the son of a divorced woman, or, that he is not the son of a halutzah; That so-and-so violated his daughter, or seduced his daughter; That my son injured me; That my neighbor injured me, or set fire to my haystack on the Sabbath\" And they deny knowledge of testimony they are exempt.","2394":"If a man said,  \u201cI adjure you that you come and bear testimony for me that so-and-so promised to give me two hundred zuz, and did not give me\u201d, they are exempt, for they are liable only for a money claim as in the case of deposit.","2395":"\u201cI adjure you that, when you know any testimony for me, you should come and bear testimony for me,\u201d they are exempt, because the oath preceded the testimony.","2396":"If he stood in the synagogue and said,  \u201cI adjure you that if you know any testimony for me you should come and bear testimony for me\u201d, they are exempt unless he directs himself to them.","2397":"If he said to two persons: \u201cI adjure you, so-and-so and so-and-so, that if you know any testimony for me you should come and bear testimony for me\u201d: And they replied,  \u201cWe swear we know no testimony for you\u201d, and they did know testimony for him, but it was evidence of one witness from the mouth of another witness; or if one of them was a relative or otherwise ineligible as a witness, they are exempt.","2398":"If he sent by the hand of his servant, or if the defendant said to them: \u201cI adjure you that if you know any testimony for him you should come and bear testimony for him\u201d, they are exempt, until they hear the adjuration direct from the claimant.","2399":"   If he said: \"I adjure you\"; \"I command you\";  \"I bind you\"; they are liable. \"By heaven and earth!\", they are exempt. \"By Alef Daleth\"; \"By Yod He\";  \"By God Almighty\"; \"By The Lord of Hosts; \"By the Merciful and Gracious one\"; \"By the Long Suffering One\";  \"By the One Abounding in Kindness\"; or by any of the substitutes for the name, they are liable.

But the Sages say, whether uttered from his own mouth or adjured by the mouth of others   since he denied it, he is liable. And he is liable for intentional transgression of the oath, and for its unintentional transgression coupled with intentional denial of having received the deposit, but he is not liable for unintentional transgression.

If he claimed from him wheat, and the other admitted barley, he is exempt. But Rabban Gamaliel makes him liable. If he claims from his neighbor jars of oil, and he admits his claim to the empty jars, Admon says, since he admits to him a portion of the same kind as the claim, he must swear. But the sages say, the admission is not of the same kind as the claim. Rabban Gamaliel said, \u201cI approve the words of admon. If he claims from him vessels and lands, and he admits the vessels, but denies the lands; or admits the lands, but denies the vessels, he is exempt. If he admits a portion of the lands, he is exempt; a portion of the vessels, he is liable because properties for which there is no security bind properties for which there is security to take an oath for them.","2408":"No oath is imposed in a claim by a deaf-mute, imbecile, or minor.

If one says, \u201cTen vines laden with fruit I delivered to you\u201d   and the other says, \u201cThere were only five\u201d; Rabbi Meir makes him take an oath; But the Sages say:  \u201cAll that is attached to land is like land.\u201d An oath is imposed only for a thing defined by size, weight, or number. How so? If one says, \u201cA store room full of produce I delivered to you,\u201d or \u201cA purse full of money I delivered to you\u201d \u2013 and the other says, \u201cI do not know; but what you left you may take,\u201d he is exempt.

But these take an oath, and receive payment: the hired laborer, he who has been robbed, he who has been wounded, and he whose opponent is suspected of taking a false oath, and the shopkeeper with his account book. \u201cThe hired laborer\u201d   How so? If he says to him his employer, \u201cGive me my wages which you owe me,\u201d and he replies, \u201cI have given,\u201d and the other says, \u201cI have not received it,\u201d he the laborer takes an oath and collects his wages.

Whether it be the oath of testimony, or the oath of deposit, or even a vain oath. If one of the litigants was a dice-player, or usurer, or pigeon-flyer, or dealer in the produce of the seventh year, his opponent takes the oath and collects his claim. If both are suspect, the oath returns to its place, these are the words of Rabbi Yose. Rabbi Meir says:  \u201cThey divide the claim.\u201d","2416":"\u201cAnd the shopkeeper with his account book,\u201d   How so? Not that he the shopkeeper says to him the customer, \u201cIt is written in my account book that you owe me two hundred zuz\u201d.

So, too, orphans cannot receive payment except on oath namely: \u201cWe swear that our father did not enjoin in his will, neither did our father say unto us, nor did we find written among the documents of our father that this document is paid.\u201d Rabbi Yochanan ben Beroka says:  \u201cEven if the son was born after his father\u2019s death he may take an oath, and collect his claim.\u201d Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said:  \u201cIf there are witnesses that the father said at the time of his death that this document was not paid, he receives his claim without an oath.\u201d","2419":"And these take an oath though there is no definite claim:  partners, tenants, guardians, the wife who transacts the affairs in the house, and the son of the house.

Engage not in too much conversation with women. They said this with regard to one\u2019s own wife, how much more does the rule apply with regard to another man\u2019s wife.

Also, reckon the loss that may be sustained through the fulfillment of a commandment against the reward accruing thereby, and the gain that may be obtained through the committing of a transgression against the loss entailed thereby. Apply your mind to three things and you will not come into the clutches of sin: Know what there is above you: an eye that sees, an ear that hears, and all your deeds are written in a book.","2445":"Rabban Gamaliel the son of Rabbi Judah Hanasi said: excellent is the study of the Torah when combined with a worldly occupation, for toil in them both keeps sin out of one\u2019s mind; But study of the Torah which is not combined with a worldly occupation, in the end comes to be neglected and becomes the cause of sin.

Rabbi Jacob said: if one is studying while walking on the road and interrupts his study and says, \u201chow fine is this tree!\u201d or \u201chow fine is this newly ploughed field!\u201d scripture accounts it to him as if he was mortally guilty.","2467":"Rabbi Dostai ben Rabbi Yannai said in the name of Rabbi Meir: whoever forgets one word of his study, scripture accounts it to him as if he were mortally guilty, as it is said, \u201cBut take utmost care and watch yourselves scrupulously, so that you do not forget the things that you saw with your own eyes\u201d (Deuteronomy 4:9). One could have inferred that this is the case even when his study proved too hard for him, therefore scripture says, \u201cthat they do not fade from your mind as long as you live\u201d (ibid.). Thus, he is not mortally guilty unless he deliberately removes them from his heart.","2468":"Rabbi Hanina ben Dosa said: anyone whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom, his wisdom is enduring, but anyone whose wisdom precedes his fear of sin, his wisdom is not enduring.

Where there is no understanding, there is no knowledge; where there is no knowledge, there is no understanding. Where there is no bread, there is no Torah; where there is no Torah, there is no bread. He used to say: one whose wisdom exceeds his deeds, to what may he be compared? To a tree whose branches are numerous but whose roots are few, so that when the wind comes, it uproots it and overturns it, as it is said, \u201cHe shall be like a bush in the desert, which does not sense the coming of good. It is set in the scorched places of the wilderness, in a barren land without inhabitant\u201d (Jeremiah 17:6). But one whose deeds exceed his wisdom, to what may he be compared?

He said to me, \u201cRabbi, would you consider living with us in our place?  I would give you a thousand thousand denarii of gold, and precious stones and pearls.\u201d I said to him: \u201cMy son, even if you were to give me all the silver and gold, precious stones and pearls that are in the world, I would not dwell anywhere except in a place of Torah; for when a man passes away there accompany him neither gold nor silver, nor precious stones nor pearls, but Torah and good deeds alone, as it is said, \u201cWhen you walk it will lead you.  When you lie down it will watch over you; and when you are awake it will talk with you\u201d (Proverbs 6:22). \u201cWhen you walk it will lead you\u201d  in this world. \u201cWhen you lie down it will watch over you\u201d  in the grave; \u201cAnd when you are awake it will talk with you\u201d in the world to come. And thus it is written in the book of Psalms by David, king of Israel, \u201cI prefer the teaching You proclaimed to thousands of pieces of gold and silver\u201d (Psalms 119:72), And it says: \u201cMine is the silver, and mine the gold, says the Lord of Hosts\u201d (Haggai 2:8).","2532":"Five possessions did the Holy Blessed One, set aside as his own in this world, and these are they:The Torah, one possession; Heaven and earth, another possession; Abraham, another possession; Israel, another possession; The Temple, another possession. 1a) The Torah is one possession.  From where do we know this? Since it is written, \u201cThe Lord possessed me at the beginning of his course, at the first of His works of old\u201d Heaven and earth, another possession. From where do we know this? Since it is said:    \u201cThus said the Lord:  The heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool;  Where could you build a house for Me, What place could serve as My abode? And it says: \u201cHow many are the things You have made, O Lord; You have made them all with wisdom; the earth is full of Your possessions\u201d Abraham is another possession. From where do we know this? Since it is written: \u201cHe blessed him, saying, \u201cBlessed by Abram of God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth\u201d Israel is another possession. From where do we know this? Since it is written: \u201cTill Your people cross over, O Lord, Till Your people whom You have possessed\u201d is in them\u201d The Temple is another possession. From where do we know this? Since it is said: \u201cThe sanctuary, O lord, which your hands have established\u201d (Exodus 15:17\u201d, And it says: \u201cAnd He brought them to His holy realm, to the mountain, which His right hand had possessed\u201d (Psalms 78:54).","2533":"Whatever the Holy Blessed One created in His world, he created only for His glory, as it is said: \u201cAll who are linked to My name, whom I have created, formed and made for My glory\u201d (Isaiah 43:7), And it says: \u201cThe Lord shall reign for ever and ever\u201d (Exodus 15:18).<br><br>Said Rabbi Hananiah ben Akashya:  It pleased the Holy Blessed One to grant merit to Israel, that is why He gave them Torah and commandments in abundance, as it is said, \u201cThe Lord was pleased for His righteousness, to make Torah great and glorious\u201d (Isaiah 42:21).","2534":"The fathers of impurity are a: sheretz, semen, an Israelite who has contracted corpse impurity, a metzora during the days of his counting, and the waters of purification whose quantity is less than the minimum needed for sprinkling. Behold, these convey impurity to people and vessels by contact and to earthenware by presence within their airspace, But they do not convey impurity by being carried.","2535":"Above them are nevelah and waters of purification whose quantity is sufficient to be sprinkled, for these convey impurity to a person even by being carried so that he in turn conveys impurity to clothing by contact. Clothing, however, is free from impurity where there was contact alone.","2536":"Above them is one who had intercourse with a menstruant, for he defiles the bottom bedding upon which he lies as he does the top bedding. Above them is the issue of a zav, his spit, his semen and his urine, and the blood of a menstruant, for they convey impurity both by contact and by carrying. Above them is an object on which one can ride, for it conveys impurity even when it lies under a heavy stone. Above the object on which one can ride is that on which one can lie, for contact is the same as its carrying. Above the object on which one can lie is the zav, for a zav conveys impurity to the object on which he lies, while the object on which he lies cannot convey the same impurity to that upon which it lies.","2537":"Above the zav is the zavah, for she conveys impurity to the man who has intercourse with her. Above the zavah is the metzora, for he conveys impurity by entering into a house. Above the metzora is a human bone the size of a barley grain, for it conveys impurity for seven days. More strict than all these is a corpse, for it conveys impurity by ohel whereby all the others convey no impurity.","2538":"There are ten grades of impurity that emanate from a person:A person before the offering of his obligatory sacrifices is forbidden to eat holy things but permitted to eat terumah and second tithe. If he is a tevul yom he is forbidden to eat holy things and terumah but permitted to eat second tithe. If he emitted semen he is forbidden to eat any of the three. If he had intercourse with a menstruant he defiles the bottom bedding upon which he lies as he does the top bedding. If he is a zav who has seen two discharges he conveys impurity to that on which he lies or sits and is required to undergo immersion in running water, but he is exempt from the sacrifice. If he saw three discharges he must bring the sacrifice. If he is a metzora that was only enclosed he conveys impurity by entry into an ohel but is exempt from loosening his hair, from rending his clothes, from shaving and from the birds offering. But if he was a confirmed metzora, he is liable for all these. If a limb on which there was not the proper quantity of flesh was severed from a person, it conveys impurity by contact and by carriage but not by ohel. But if it has the proper quantity of flesh it conveys impurity by contact, by carriage and by ohel. A \"proper quantity of flesh\" is such as is capable of healing. Rabbi Judah says: if in one place it has flesh sufficient to surround it with the thickness of a thread of the woof it is capable of healing.","2539":"There are ten grades of holiness: the land of Israel is holier than all other lands. And what is the nature of its holiness? That from it are brought the omer, the firstfruits and the two loaves, which cannot be brought from any of the other lands.","2540":"Cities that are walled are holier, for metzoras must be sent out of them and a corpse, though it may be carried about within them as long as it is desired, may not be brought back once it has been taken out.","2541":"The area within the wall of Jerusalem is holier, for it is there that lesser holy things and second tithe may be eaten. The Temple Mount is holier, for zavim, zavot, menstruants and women after childbirth may not enter it. The chel is holier, for neither non-Jews nor one who contracted corpse impurity may enter it. The court of women is holier, for a tevul yom may not enter it, though he is not obligated a hatat for doing so. The court of the Israelites is holier, for a man who has not yet offered his obligatory sacrifices may not enter it, and if he enters he is liable for a hatat. The court of the priests is holier, for Israelites may not enter it except when they are required to do so: for laying on of the hands, slaying or waving.","2542":"The area between the porch and the altar is holier, for priests who have blemishes or unkempt hair may not enter it. The Hekhal is holier, for no one whose hands or feet are unwashed may enter it. The Holy of Holies is holier, for only the high priest, on Yom Kippur, at the time of the service, may enter it. Rabbi Yose said: in five respects the area between the porch and the altar is equal to the Hekhal, for those afflicted with blemishes or with a wild growth of hair, or who have drunk wine or whose hands or feet are unwashed may not enter there, and the people must keep away from the area between the porch and the altar  when the incense is being burned.","2543":"Vessels of wood, vessels of leather, vessels of bone or vessels of glass: If they are simple they are clean If they form a receptacle they are unclean. If they were broken they become clean again. If one remade them into vessels they are susceptible to impurity henceforth. Earthen vessels and vessels of sodium carbonate are equal in respect of impurity: they contract and convey impurity through their air-space; they convey impurity through the outside but they do not become impure through their backs; and when broken they become clean.","2544":"As regards the smallest earthen vessels, and the bottoms and sides of the larger but broken vessels that can stand unsupported: The prescribed size is a capacity to hold oil sufficient for the anointing of a little finger of a child if their former capacity was that of a log. If their former capacity was from one log to a se'ah their present capacity must be a quarter of a log. If it was from a se'ah to two se'ah it must be half a log. If from two se'ah to three se'ah or as much as five se'ah it must be a log, the words of Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: I do not prescribe any size for the unbroken vessels, rather: as regards the smallest earthen vessels, and the bottoms and sides of larger but broken ones that can stand unsupported: The prescribed size is a capacity to hold enough oil to anoint the little finger of a child. This size is prescribed for pots that are not bigger than the small cooking-pots. For small cooking-pots and for those between these and the jars from Lydda the prescribed capacity is a quarter of a log. For those which have a size between that of Lydda jars and Bethlehem jars the capacity must be that of half a log. For those between Bethlehem jars and large stone jars the capacity must be that of a log. Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai says: the prescribed capacity for the fragments of large stone jars is two logs, and that for the bottoms of broken Galilean flasks and small jars is any whatsoever, but the fragments of their sides are not susceptible to impurity","2545":"The following are not susceptible to impurity among earthen vessels: A tray without a rim, A broken incense-pan, A pierced pan for roasting corn, Gutters even if they are bent and even if they have some form of receptacle, A cooking vessel that was turned into a bread-basket cover, A bucket that was turned into a cover for grapes, A barrel used for swimmers, A small jar fixed to the sides of a ladle, A bed, a stool, a bench, a table, a ship, and an earthen lamp, behold these are no susceptible to impurity. The following is a general rule: any among earthen vessels that has no inner part is not susceptible to impurity on its outer sides.","2546":"A lantern that has a receptacle for oil is susceptible to impurity, but one that has none is not susceptible. A potter's mould on which one begins to shape the clay is not susceptible to impurity, but that on which one finishes it is susceptible. A funnel for home use is not susceptible to impurity, but that of merchants is susceptible because it also serves as a measure, the words of Rabbi Judah ben Batera. Rabbi Akiva says: because he puts it on its side to let the buyer smell it.","2547":"The covers of wine jars and oil jars and the covers of papyrus jars are not susceptible to impurity But if he adapted them for use as receptacles they are susceptible. The cover of a pot: When it has a hole or it has a point, it is not susceptible to impurity, But if it does not have a hole or a pointed top it is susceptible because she drains the vegetables into it. Rabbi Eliezer bar Zadok says: because she turns out the contents of the pot on to it.","2548":"A damaged jar found in a furnace: Before its manufacture was complete it is not susceptible to impurity, But if after its manufacture was complete it is susceptible. A sprinkler: Rabbi Eliezer bar Zadok holds it is not susceptible to impurity; But Rabbi Yose holds it to be susceptible because it lets the liquid out in drops only.","2549":"The following among earthen vessels are susceptible to impurity:A tray with a rim, An unbroken fire-pan, And a tray made up of dishes, If one of them was defiled by a dead creeping thing they do not all become unclean, But if it had a rim that projected above the rims of the dishes and one of them was defiled all are unclean. Similarly with an earthen spice-box and a double ink-pot. If one container was defiled from a liquid, the other is not unclean. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: its thickness is divided and that side which serves the unclean one is unclean while that which serves the clean one remains clean. If its rim projects above the others and one of them contracted impurity the other is unclean.","2550":"A torch is susceptible to impurity. And the reservoir of a lamp contracts impurity through its air- space. The comb of a tzartzur: Rabbi Eliezer says: it is not susceptible to impurity, But the sages say that it is susceptible.","2551":"The size of a hole that renders an earthen vessel clean:If the vessel was made for food, the hole must be big enough for olives to fall through. If it was used for liquids it suffices for the hole to be big enough for liquids to go through it. And if it was used for both, we apply the greater stringency, that olives must be able to fall through.","2552":"A jar: the size of the hole must be such that a dried fig will fall through, the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Judah said: walnuts. Rabbi Meir said: olives. A stew-pot or a cooking pot: such that olives will fall through. A bucket and a pitcher: such that oil will fall through. A tzartzur: such that water will fall through. Rabbi Shimon says: in the case of all three, the hole must be such that seedlings will fall through. A lamp: the size of the hole must be such that oil will fall through. Rabbi Eliezer says: such that a small perutah will fall through. A lamp whose nozzle has been removed is clean. And one made of earth whose nozzle has been burned by the wick is also clean.","2553":"A jar that had a hole and was mended with pitch and then was broken again: If the fragment that was mended with the pitch can hold a quarter of a log it is unclean, since the designation of a vessel has never ceased to be applied to it. A potsherd that had a hole and was mended with pitch, it is clean though it can contain a quarter of a log, because the designation of a vessel has ceased to be applied to it.","2554":"If a jar was about to be cracked but was strengthened with cattle dung, although the potsherds would fall apart were the dung to be removed, it is unclean, because the designation of vessel never ceased to apply. If it was broken and some of its pieces were stuck together again, or if he brought other pieces of clay from elsewhere, and it was also lined with cattle dung, even though the potsherds hold together when the dung is removed, it is clean, because the designation of vessel ceased to apply. If it contained one potsherd that could hold a quarter of a log, all its parts contract impurity by contact, but that potsherd contracts impurity through its air-space.","2555":"One who lines a sound vessel: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon say: the lining   contracts impurity. But the sages say: a lining over a sound vessel is not susceptible to impurity, and only one over a cracked vessel is susceptible. And the same dispute applies to the hoop of a pumpkin shell.","2556":"As to dog's tooth which which they line large jars: anything that touches it becomes unclean. The plug of a jar is not regarded as connected. That which touches the lining of an oven is unclean.","2557":"A cauldron which was lined with mortar or with potter's clay: That which touches the mortar is unclean; But that which touches the potter's clay is clean. A kettle which was punctured and the hole was stopped with pitch: Rabbi Yose rules that it is clean since it cannot hold hot water as cold. The same ruling he also gave concerning vessels made of pitch. Copper vessels which were lined with pitch the lining is clean, But if they are used for wine, it is unclean.","2558":"A jar which which was pierced and the hole stopped up with more pitch than was necessary: That which touches the needed portion is unclean, But that which touches the unneeded portion is clean. Pitch which dripped upon a jar, that which touches it is clean. A wooden or earthen funnel which was stopped up with pitch: Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says that it is unclean. Rabbi Akiva says that it is unclean when it is of wood and clean when it is of earthenware. Rabbi Yose says that both are clean.","2559":"A potsherd that cannot stand unsupported on account of its handle, or a potsherd whose bottom is pointed and that point causes it to overbalance, is clean. If the handle was removed or the point was broken off it is still clean. Rabbi Judah says that it is unclean. If a jar was broken but is still capable of holding something in its sides, or if it was split into a kind of two troughs: Rabbi Judah says it is clean But the sages say it is unclean.","2560":"If a jar was cracked and cannot be moved with half a kav of dried figs in it, it is clean. If a damaged vessel was cracked and it cannot hold any liquid, even though it can hold foodstuffs, it is clean, since remnants do not have remnants.","2561":"What is meant by a \"damaged vessel\" (gistera)? One whose handles were removed. If sharp ends projected from it: Any part of it which can contain olives contracts impurity by contact, while any impurity opposite an end conveys impurity to the vessel through its air-space, But any part of it which cannot contain olives contracts impurity by contact, while an impurity opposite an end does not convey impurity through its air-space. If it was leaning on its side like a kind of cathedra, Any part of it which can contain olives contracts impurity by contact, while any impurity opposite an end conveys impurity to the vessel through its air-space, But any part of it which cannot contain olives contracts impurity by contact, while an impurity opposite an end does not convey impurity to the vessel through its air-space. Bowls with Korfian bottoms, and cups with Zidonian bottoms, although they cannot stand unsupported, are susceptible to impurity, because they were originally fashioned in this manner.","2562":"An earthenware vessel that has three rims: If the innermost one projects above the others, all outside it is not susceptible to impurity. If the outermost one projects above the others all within it is susceptible to impurity; And if the middle one projects above the others, that which is within it is susceptible to impurity, while that which is without it is not susceptible to impurity. If they were equal in height: Rabbi Judah says: the middle one is deemed to be divided. But the sages ruled: all are not susceptible to impurity. When do earthenware vessels become susceptible to impurity? As soon as they are baked in the furnace, that being the completion of their manufacture.","2563":"A baking oven originally must be no less than four handbreadths high and what is left of it four handbreadths, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: this applies only to a large oven but in the case of a small one it originally can be any height and what is left is the greater part of it. Its susceptibility to impurity begins as soon as its manufacture is completed. What is regarded as the completion of its manufacture? When it is heated to a degree that suffices for the baking of spongy cakes. Rabbi Judah says: when a new oven has been heated to a degree that sufficed for the baking of spongy cakes in an old one.","2564":"A double stove: its original height must be no less than three fingerbreadths and what is left of it three fingerbreadths. Its susceptibility to impurity begins as soon as its manufacture is completed. What is regarded as the completion of its manufacture? When it is heated to a degree that suffices for the cooking of the lightest of eggs when scrambled and put in a saucepan. A single stove: if it was made for baking its prescribed size is the same as that for a baking-oven, and if it was made for cooking its prescribed size is the same as that for a double stove. A stone that projects one handbreadth from a baking-oven or three fingerbreadths from a double stove is considered a connection. One that projects from a single stove, if it was made for baking, the prescribed size is the same as that for a baking-oven, and if it was made for cooking the prescribed size is the same as that for a double stove. Rabbi Judah said: they spoke of a \u2018handbreadth\u2019 only where the projection was between the oven and a wall. If two ovens were adjacent to one another, they allot one handbreadth to this one and one to the other and the remainder is clean.","2565":"The crown of a double stove is clean. The fender around an oven: if it is four handbreadths high it contracts impurity by contact and through its air-space, but if it was lower it is clean. If it was joined to it, even if only by three stones, it is unclean. The place on the stove for the oil cruse, the spice-pot, and the lamp contract impurity by contact but not through their air-space, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Ishmael rules that they are clean.","2566":"An oven that was heated from its outside, or one that was heated without the owner's knowledge, or one that was heated while still in the craftsman's house is susceptible to impurity. It once happened that a fire broke out among the ovens of Kefar Signah, and when the case was brought up at Yavneh Rabban Gamaliel ruled that they were unclean.","2567":"The additional piece of a householder's oven is clean, but that of bakers is unclean because he rests the roasting spit on it. Rabbi Yohanan Hasandlar said: because one bakes on it when pressed for space. Similarly the additional part of the boiler used by olive cookers is susceptible to impurity, but that of one used by dyers is not susceptible.","2568":"If an oven was half filled with earth, the part from the earth downwards contracts impurity by contact only while the part from the earth upwards contracts impurity also from its air- space. If he put the oven over the mouth of a cistern or over that of a cellar and he put a stone at its side: Rabbi Judah says: if when heated below it becomes also heated above it is susceptible to impurity. But the sages say: since it was heated, no matter how, it is susceptible to impurity.","2569":"If an oven contracted impurity how is it to be cleansed? He must divide into three parts and scrape off the plastering so that the oven touches the ground. Rabbi Meir says: he does not need to scrape off the plastering nor is it necessary for the oven to touch the ground. Rather he reduces it within to a height of less than four handbreadths. Rabbi Shimon says: he must move it from its position. If it was divided into two parts, one large and the other small, the larger remains unclean and the smaller becomes clean. If it was divided into three parts one of which was as big as the other two together, the big one remains unclean and the two small ones become clean.","2570":"If an oven was cut up by its width into rings that are each less than four handbreadths in height, it is clean. If he subsequently plastered it over with clay, it becomes susceptible to impurity when it is heated to a degree that suffices for the baking of spongy cakes. If he distanced the plastering, and sand or gravel was put between it and the oven sides   of such an oven it has been said, \"A menstruant as well as a clean woman may bake in it and it remains clean.\"","2571":"An oven which came cut up in sections from the craftsman's house and he made for it hoops and put them on it, it is clean. If it contracts impurity, and then he removed its hoops it is clean. If he put them back on, it is still clean. If he plastered it with clay, it becomes susceptible to impurity and there is no need to heat it since it was once heated.","2572":"If he cut the oven up into rings, and then he put sand between each pair of rings,   Rabbi Eliezer says: it is clean. But the sages say: it is unclean. This is the oven of Akhnai. As regards Arabian vats, which are holes dug in the ground and plastered with clay, if the plastering can stand of itself it is susceptible to impurity; Otherwise it is not susceptible. This is the oven of Ben Dinai.","2573":"An oven of stone or of metal is clean, But the latter is unclean as a metal vessel. If a hole was made in it, or if it was damaged or cracked, and he lined it with plaster or with a rim of clay, it is unclean. What must be the size of the hole for it to be pure?  It must be big enough for the flame to come through. The same applies also to a stove. A stove of stone or of metal is clean. But the latter is unclean as a metal vessel. If a hole was made in it or if it was damaged or cracked but was provided with props it is unclean. If it was lined with clay, whether inside or outside, it remains clean. Rabbi Judah says: if the lining was inside it is unclean but if outside it remains clean.","2574":"If he put three props into the ground and joined them to the ground with clay so that a pot could be set on them, the structure is susceptible to impurity. If he set three nails in the ground so that a pot could be set on them, even though a place was made on the top for the pot to rest, the structure is not susceptible to impurity. One who made a stove of two stones, joining them to the ground with clay: It is susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Judah says that it is not susceptible to impurity, unless a third stone is added or the structure is placed near a wall. If one stone was joined with clay and the other was not joined with clay, the structure is not susceptible to impurity.","2575":"A stone on which he placed a pot, on it and on an oven, or on it and a double stove, or on it and on a stove, is susceptible to impurity. If he set the pot on it and on another stone, on it and on a rock, or on it and on a wall, it is not susceptible to impurity. And such was the stove of the Nazirites in Jerusalem which was set up against a rock. As regards the stove of the butchers, where the stones are placed side by side, if one of the stoves contracted impurity, the others do not become unclean.","2576":"If one made two stoves of three stones and one of the outer ones was defiled the half of the middle one that serves the unclean one is unclean but the half of it that serves the clean one remains clean. If the clean one was removed, the middle one is regarded as completely transferred to the unclean one. If the unclean one was removed, the middle one is regarded as completely transferred to the clean one. Should the two outer ones become defiled, if the middle stone was large, each outer stone is allowed such a part of it as suffices for the support of a pot and the remainder is clean. But if it was small all of it is unclean. Should the middle stone be removed, if a big kettle can be set on the two outer stones they are unclean. If the middle stone is returned they all become clean again. If it was plastered with clay it becomes susceptible to impurity when it is heated to a degree that suffices for the cooking of an egg.","2577":"If two stones were made into a stove and they became defiled, and a stone was set up near the outer side of the one and another stone near the outer side of the other, the inner half of each inner stones remains unclean while the outer half of each of these stones is clean. If the clean stones are removed the others revert to their impurity.","2578":"The fire-basket of a householder which was lessened by less than three handbreadths is susceptible to impurity because when it is heated from below a pot above would still boil. If it was lessened to a lower depth it is not susceptible to impurity. If subsequently a stone or gravel was put into it, it is still not susceptible to impurity. If it was plastered over with clay, it may contract impurity from that point and onwards. This was Rabbi Judah's reply in connection with the oven that was placed over the mouth of a cistern or over that of a cellar.","2579":"A hob that has a receptacle for pots is clean as a stove but unclean as a receptacle. As to its sides, whatever touches them does not become unclean as if the hob had been a stove, But as regards its wide side: Rabbi Meir holds it to be clean But Rabbi Judah holds it to be unclean. The same law applies also where a basket was inverted and a stove was put upon it.","2580":"A double stove which was split into two parts along its length is clean. Through its breadth is unclean. A single stove which was split into two parts, by its length or by its width, it is not susceptible to impurity. As to the extension around a stove, whenever it is three fingerbreadths high it contracts impurity by contact and also through its air-space, but if it is less it contracts impurity through contact and not through its air- space. How is the air-space determined? Rabbi Ishmael says: He puts a spit from above to below and opposite it contracts impurity through the air-space. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: if the stove contracted impurity the extension is also unclean, but if the fender contracts impurity the stove does not become unclean.","2581":"If it the extension was detached from the stove, whenever it was three fingerbreadths high it contracts impurity by contact and through its air-space, If it was lower or if it was smooth it is clean. If three props on a stove were three fingerbreadths high, they contract impurity by contact and through their air-space. If they were lower, all the more so they contract impurity, even where they were four in number.","2582":"If one of them i.e. the props was removed, the remaining ones contract impurity by contact but not through air-space, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says that they are clean. If originally he made two props, one opposite the other, they contract impurity by contact and through air-space; the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says that they are clean. If they were more than three fingerbreadths high, the parts that are three fingerbreadths high and below contract impurity by contact and through air-space but the parts that are more than three fingerbreadths high contract impurity by contact and not through air-space; the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says that they are clean. If they were withdrawn from the rim of the stove, the parts which are within three fingerbreadths contract impurity by contact and through air-space, and those parts that are removed more than three fingerbreadths contract impurity by contact but not through air-space, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says that they are clean.","2583":"How do we measure them? Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: he puts the measuring-rod between them, and any part that is outside the measuring-rod is clean while any part inside the measuring-rod, including the place of the measuring-rod itself, is unclean.","2584":"An oven which they partitioned with boards or hangings, and in it was found a sheretz in one compartment, the entire oven is unclean. A hive which was broken and its gap was stopped up with straw and was suspended within the air-space of an oven while a sheretz was within it, the oven becomes unclean. If a sheretz was within the oven, any food within the hive becomes unclean. But Rabbi Eliezer says that it is clean. Rabbi Eliezer said: if it affords protection in the case of a corpse which is more consequential, should it not afford protection in the case of an earthenware vessel which is less consequential? They said to him: if it affords protection in the case of corpse impurity, this is because tents are divided, should it also afford protection in the case of an earthenware vessel which is not divided?","2585":"If the hive was complete, and so too in the case of a basket or a skin-bottle, and a sheretz was within it the oven remains clean. If the sheretz was in the oven, any food in the hive remain clean. If a hole was made in it: A vessel that is used for food must have a hole large enough for olives to fall through, If it is used for liquids the hole must be large enough for liquids to pass into it, And if it is used for either it is subjected to the greater restriction: the hole need only be large enough for liquids to pass into it.","2586":"Netting placed over the mouth of an oven and slightly sinking into it, and having no frame: If a sheretz was in it, the oven becomes unclean; If the sheretz was in the oven, the food in the netting becomes unclean, since only vessels afford protection against an impurity in an earthen vessel. A jar full of pure liquids placed beneath the bottom of an oven, and a sheretz in the oven \u2013 the jar and the liquids remain clean. If it was inverted, with its mouth projecting into the air-space of the oven, and a sheretz was in the oven, the liquid that clings to the sides of the jar remains clean.","2587":"A pot which was placed in an oven if a sheretz was in the oven, the pot remains clean since an earthen vessel does not impart impurity to vessels. If it contained dripping liquid, the latter contracts impurity and the pot also becomes unclean. It is as if this one says, \"That which made you unclean did not make me unclean, but you have made me unclean.\"","2588":"If a rooster that swallowed a sheretz fell within the air-space of an oven, the oven remains clean; If the rooster died, the oven becomes unclean. If a sheretz was found in an oven, any bread in it contracts second degree impurity since the oven is of the first degree.","2589":"A leavening pot with a tightly fitting lid which was put in an oven, and there was some leaven and a sheretz within the pot, but there was a partition between them, the oven is unclean but the leaven is clean. But if it was an olive's bulk of corpse, both the oven and the house are unclean, and the leaven remains clean. If in the partition there was an opening of one handbreadth, all become unclean.","2590":"A sheretz which was found in the eye-hole of an oven or of a double stove or of a single stove: If it was outside the inner edge, it is clean. If it the oven was in the open air, even if it was an olive's bulk of corpse it is clean. If there was in the eye-hole an opening of one handbreadth, it is all unclean.","2591":"If a sheretz was found in the place in a stove where wood is put: Rabbi Judah says: if it was within the outer edge, the stove becomes unclean. But the sages say: if it was outside the inner edge the stove remains clean. Rabbi Yose says: if it was found beneath the spot where the pot is placed and inwards, the stove becomes unclean, but if beneath the spot where the pot is set and outwards, it remains clean. If it was found on the place where the bath-keeper sits, or where the dyer sits, or where the olive-boilers sit, the stove remains clean. It only becomes unclean only when the sheretz is found in the enclosed part and inwards.","2592":"A pit which has a place on which a pot may be set is unclean. And so also an oven of glass-blowers, if it has a place on which a pot may be set, it is unclean. The furnace of lime-burners, or of glaziers, or of potters is clean. A purna: If it has a frame is unclean. Rabbi Judah says: if it has coverings for compartments. Rabban Gamaliel says: if it has edges.","2593":"If a person who came in contact with one who has contracted corpse impurity had (food liquids in his mouth and he put his head into the air-space of an oven that was clean, they cause the oven to be unclean. If a person who was clean had food or liquids in his mouth and he put his head into the air-space of an oven that was unclean, they become unclean. If a person was eating a pressed fig with impure hands and he put his hand into his mouth to remove a small stone: Rabbi Meir considers the fig to be unclean But Rabbi Judah says it as clean. Rabbi Yose says: if he turned it over in his mouth the fig is unclean but if he did not turn it over the fig is clean. If the person had a pondion in his mouth, Rabbi Yose says: if he kept it there to relieve his thirst it becomes unclean.","2594":"If milk of an impure woman dripped from a woman's breasts and fell into the air-space of an oven, the oven becomes unclean, since a liquid conveys impurity regardless of whether one wanted it there or not. If she was sweeping it out and a thorn pricked her and she bled, or if she burnt herself and put her finger into her mouth, the oven becomes unclean.","2595":"If a needle or a ring was found in the ground of an oven, and they can be seen but they don't stick out into the oven, if one bakes dough and it touches them, the oven is unclean. Regarding which dough did they speak? Medium dough. If they are found in the plaster of an oven with a tightly fitting lid: If the oven is unclean, they are unclean, If the oven is clean, they are clean. If they are found in the stopper of a jar: If on the sides, they are unclean. If opposite the mouth, they are clean. If they can be seen in it, but they do not enter its airspace, they are clean. If they sink into it, and there is plaster underneath them as thick as garlic peel, they are clean.","2596":"A jar that was full of clean liquids, with a siphon in it, and it had a tightly fitting cover and was in a tent in which there was a corpse: Bet Shammai says: both the jar and the liquids are clean but the siphon is unclean. And Bet Hillel says: the siphon also is clean. Bet Hillel changed their mind and ruled in agreement with Bet Shammai.","2597":"If a sheretz was found beneath the bottom of an oven, the oven remains clean, for I can assume that it fell there while it was still alive and that it died only now. If a needle or a ring was found beneath the bottom of an oven, the oven remains clean, for I can assume that they were there before the oven arrived. If it was found in the wood ashes, the oven is unclean since one has no ground on which to base an assumption of cleanness.","2598":"A sponge which had absorbed unclean liquids and its outer surface became dry and it fell into the air-space of an oven, the oven is unclean, for the liquid would eventually come out. And the same with regard to a piece of turnip or reed grass. Rabbi Shimon says: the oven is clean in both these cases.","2599":"Potsherds that had been used for unclean liquids which fell into the air-space of an oven, if the oven was heated, it becomes unclean, for the liquid   would eventually come out. And the same with regard to fresh olive peat, but if it was old, the oven remains clean. If it was known that liquid emerges, even after the lapse of three years, the oven becomes unclean.","2600":"If olive peat or grape skins had been prepared in conditions of cleanness, and unclean persons trod upon them and afterwards liquids emerged from them, they remain clean, since they had originally been prepared in conditions of cleanness. If a spindle hook was sunk into the spindle, or the iron point into the ox goad, or a ring into a brick, and all these were clean, and then they were brought into a tent   in which was a corpse, they become unclean. If a zav caused them to move they become unclean. If they then fell into the air-space of a clean oven, they cause it to be unclean. If a loaf of terumah came in contact with them, it remains clean.","2601":"If there was netting placed over the mouth of an oven, forming a tightly fitting lid, and a split appeared between the oven and the colander, the minimum size to allow impurity to enter is that of the circumference of the tip of an ox goad that cannot actually enter it. Rabbi Judah says: it must be one into which the tip can actually enter. If a split appeared in the netting, the minimum size is the circumference of the tip of an ox goad that can enter it. Rabbi Judah says: even if it cannot enter. If the split was curved it must not be regarded as straight, and still the minimum size must be the circumference of the tip of an ox goad that can actually enter.","2602":"If there was a hole in the \"eye\" of an oven, the minimum size for it to leave the category of being tightly closed is the circumference of a burning spindle staff that can enter and come out without being extinguished. Rabbi Judah says: one that is not burning. If the hole appeared at its side, the minimum size must be that of the circumference of a spindle staff that can enter and come out while it is not burning. Rabbi Judah says: while burning. Rabbi Shimon says: if the hole is in the middle its size must be such that a spindle staff can enter it, but if it was at the side it need only be such as the spindle staff cannot actually enter. And similarly he used to rule concerning the stopper of a jar in which a hole appeared: the minimum size is the circumference of the second knot in an oat stalk. If the hole was in the middle the stalk should be able to enter, and if at the side it need not be able to enter. And similarly he used to rule concerning large stone jars in the stoppers of which appeared a hole. The minimum size is the circumference of the second knot in a reed. If the hole was in the middle the reed must be able to enter it, and if it was at the side the reed need not be able to enter it. When is this so? When the jars were made for wine, but if they were made for other liquids, if they have even the smallest hole, they are unclean. When is this so? When the holes were not made by a person, but if they were made by a person, if they have even the smallest hole, they are unclean. If a hole appeared in other vessels its prescribed size  is as follows: if the vessel was used for food, the hole must be one through which olives can fall out; if for liquids, one that lets out liquids; If for either, the greater restriction is imposed even with regard to the issue of a tightly fitting cover the size of the hole need only be one that admits a liquid.","2603":"The following vessels protect their contents when they have a tightly fitting cover:  those made of cattle dung, of stone, of clay, of earthenware, of sodium carbonate, of the bones of a fish or of its skin, or of the bones of any animal of the sea or of its skin, and wooden vessels that are always clean. They protect whether the covers close their mouths or their sides, whether they stand on their bottoms or lean on their sides. If they were turned over with their mouths downwards they afford protection to all that is beneath them to the nethermost deep. Rabbi Eliezer declares this unclean. These protect everything, except that an earthen vessel protects only foods, liquids and earthen vessels.","2604":"How may it be tightly covered? With lime or gypsum, pitch or wax, mud or excrement, crude clay or potter's clay, or any substance that is used for plastering. One may not make a tightly fitting cover with tin or with lead because though it is a covering, it is not tightly fitting. One may not make a tightly fitting cover with swollen fig-cakes or with dough that was kneaded with fruit juice, since it might cause it to become unfit. If he did make a tightly fitting cover from such material it protects.","2605":"A stopper of a jar that is loose but does not fall out: Rabbi Judah says: it protects. But the sages say: it does not protect. If its finger-hold was sunk within the jar and a sheretz was in it, the jar becomes unclean. If the sheretz was in the jar, any food in it, become unclean.","2606":"If a ball or coil of reed grass was placed over the mouth of a jar, and only its sides   were plastered, it does not protect unless it was also plastered above or below. The same is true with regard to a patch of cloth. If it was of paper or leather and bound with a cord, if he plastered it from the sides, it protects.","2607":"If the outer layer a jar had been peeled off but its pitch lining remained intact, And similarly if pots of fish brine were sealed up with gypsum at a level with the brim: Rabbi Judah says: they do not protect. But the sages say: they do protect.","2608":"If a jar had a hole in it and wine lees stopped it up, they protect it. If one stopped it up with a vine shoot it does not protect until he plasters it at the sides. If there were two vine shoots, it does not protect unless he plastered it at the sides and also between the one shoot and the other. If a board was placed over the mouth of an oven, it protects if he plastered it at the sides. If there were two boards it does not protect unless he plastered at the sides and also between the one board and the other. If they were fastened together with pegs or with bamboo joints there is no need for them to be plastered in the middle.","2609":"An old oven was within a new one and netting was over the mouth of the old new one: If it was placed such that if the old one were to be removed the netting would drop, all the contents of both ovens are unclean; But if it would not drop, all are clean. A new oven was within an old one and netting was over the mouth of the old one if there was not a handbreadth of space between the new oven and the netting,  all the contents of the new one are clean.","2610":"If earthenware pans were placed one within the other and their rims were on the same level, and there was a sheretz in the upper one or in the lower one, that pan alone becomes unclean but all the others remain clean. If they were perforated to the extent of admitting a liquid, and the sheretz was in the uppermost one, all become unclean. If in the lowest one, that one is unclean while the others remain clean. If the sheretz was in the uppermost one and the lowest projected above it, both are unclean. If the sheretz was in the uppermost one and the lowest projected above it, any one that contained dripping liquid becomes unclean.","2611":"Metal vessels, whether they are flat or form a receptacle, are susceptible to impurity. On being broken they become clean. If they were re-made into vessels they revert to their former impurity. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: this does not apply to every form of impurity but only to that contracted from a corpse.","2612":"Every metal vessel that has a name of its own is susceptible to impurity, Except for a door, a bolt, a lock, a socket under a hinge, a hinge, a clapper, and the threshold groove under a door post, since these are intended to be attached to the ground.","2613":"If vessels are made from iron ore, from smelted iron, from the hoop of a wheel, from sheets, from plating, from the bases, rims or handles of vessels, from chippings or filings, they are clean. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: even those made of pieces of vessels. From vessels that are made of fragments of vessels, from pieces of old vessels, or from nails that were known to have been made from vessels, are unclean. If they were made from ordinary nails: Bet Shammai says: they are unclean, And Bet Hillel says that they are clean.","2614":"If unclean iron was smelted together with clean iron and the greater part was from the unclean iron, the vessel made of the mixture is unclean; If the greater part was from the clean iron, the vessel is clean. If each was half, it is unclean. The same law also applies to a mixture of cement and cattle dung. A door bolt is susceptible to impurity, but one of wood that is only plated with metal is not susceptible to impurity. The clutch and the crosspiece of a lock are susceptible to impurity. A door-bolt: Rabbi Joshua says: he may remove it from one door and hang it on another on Shabbat. Rabbi Tarfon says: it is like all other vessels and may be carried about in a courtyard.","2615":"The scorpion -shaped bit of a bridle is susceptible to impurity, but the cheek-pieces are clean. Rabbi Eliezer says that the cheek-pieces are susceptible to impurity. But the sages says that the scorpion-bit alone is susceptible to impurity, When they are joined together it is all susceptible to impurity.","2616":"A metal spindle-knob:Rabbi Akiva says it is susceptible to impurity But the sages say it is not susceptible. If it was only plated with metal it is clean. A spindle, a distaff, a rod, a double flute and a pipe are susceptible to impurity if they are of metal, but if they are only plated with metal they are clean. If a double flute has a receptacle for the wings it is susceptible to impurity in either case.","2617":"A curved horn is susceptible to impurity but a straight one is clean. If its mouthpiece was covered with metal it is unclean. If its broad side is covered with metal: Rabbi Tarfon says it is susceptible to impurity But the sages say it is clean. While they are joined together the whole is susceptible to impurity. Similarly: the branches of a candlestick are clean. And the cups and the base are susceptible to impurity, But while they are joined together the whole is susceptible to impurity.","2618":"A helmet is susceptible to impurity but the cheek-pieces are clean, But if they have a receptacle for water they are susceptible to impurity. All weapons of war are susceptible to impurity: a javelin, a spear-head, metal boots, and a breastplate are susceptible to impurity. All women's ornaments are susceptible to impurity: a golden city (a tiara), a necklace, ear-rings, finger-rings, a ring whether it has a seal or does not have a seal, and nose-rings. If a necklace has metal beads on a thread of flax or wool and the thread broke, the beads are still susceptible to impurity, since each one is a vessel in itself. If the thread was of metal and the beads were of precious stones or pearls or glass, and the beads were broken while the thread alone remained, it is still susceptible to impurity. The remnant of a necklace is susceptible as long as there is enough for the neck of a little girl. Rabbi Eliezer says: even if only one ring remained it is unclean, since it also is hung around the neck.","2619":"If an earring was shaped like a pot at its bottom and like a lentil at the top and the sections fell apart, the pot-shaped section is susceptible to impurity because it is a receptacle, while the lentil shaped section is susceptible to impurity in itself. The hooklet is clean. If the sections of an ear-ring that was in the shape of a cluster of grapes fell apart, they   are clean.","2620":"A man's ring is susceptible to impurity. A ring for cattle or for vessels and all other rings are clean. A beam for arrows is susceptible to impurity, but one for prisoners is clean. A prisoner's collar is susceptible to impurity. A chain that has a lock-piece is susceptible to impurity. But that used for tying up cattle is clean. The chain used by wholesalers is susceptible to impurity. That used by householders is clean. Rabbi Yose said: When is this so? When it attaches to one door, but if it attaches to two doors or if it had a snail-shaped piece at its end it is susceptible to impurity.","2621":"The beam of a wool-combers\u2019 balance is susceptible to impurity on account of the hooks. And that of a householder, if it has hooks is also susceptible to impurity. The hooks of porters are clean but those of peddlers are susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Judah says: in the case of the peddlers' hooks, the hook that is in front is susceptible to impurity but that which is behind is clean. The hook of a couch is susceptible to impurity but that of bed poles is clean. The hook of a chest is susceptible to impurity but that of a fish trap is clean. That of a table is susceptible to impurity but that of a wooden candlestick is clean. This is the general rule: any hook that is attached to a susceptible vessel is susceptible to impurity, but one that is attached to a vessel that is not susceptible to impurity is clean. All these, however, are by themselves clean.","2622":"The metal cover of a basket of householders: Rabban Gamaliel says: it is susceptible to impurity, The sages say that it is clean. But that of physicians is susceptible to impurity. The door of a cupboard of householders is clean but that of physicians is susceptible to impurity. Tongs are susceptible to impurity but stove-tongs are clean. The scorpion -shaped hook in an olive-press is susceptible to impurity but the hooks for the walls are clean.","2623":"A blood-letters\u2019 nail is susceptible to impurity.

The chest of a grist-dealer: Rabbi Zadok says: it is susceptible to impurity, But the sages say that it is clean. If its wagon was made of metal it is susceptible to impurity.","2624":"A nail which he adapted to be able to open or to shut a lock is susceptible to impurity. But one used for guarding is clean. A nail which he adapted to open a jar: Rabbi Akiva says that it is susceptible to impurity, But the sages say that it is clean unless he forges it. A money-changer's nail is clean, But Rabbi Zadok says: it is susceptible to impurity. There are three things which Rabbi Zadok holds to be susceptible to impurity and the sages hold clean: The nail of a money-changer, The chest of a grist-dealer And the nail of a sundial. Rabbi Zadok rules that these are susceptible to impurity and the sages rule that they are clean.","2625":"There are four things which Rabban Gamaliel says are susceptible to impurity, and the sages say are not susceptible to impurity.The covering of a metal basket, if it belongs to householders; And the hanger of a strigil; And metal vessels which are still unshaped; And a plate that is divided into two equal parts. And the sages agree with Rabban Gamaliel in the case of a plate that was divided into two parts, one large and one small, that the large one is susceptible to impurity and the small one is not susceptible to impurity.","2626":"If a dinar had been invalidated and then was adapted for hanging around a young girl's neck it is susceptible to impurity. So, too, if a sela had been invalidated was adapted for use as a weight, it is susceptible to impurity. How much may it depreciate while one is still permitted to keep it? As much as two denars. Less and he must be cut it up.","2627":"A pen-knife, a writing pen, a plummet, a weight, pressing plates, a measuring-rod, and a measuring-table are susceptible to impurity. All unfinished wooden vessels also are susceptible to impurity, excepting those made of boxwood. Rabbi Judah says: one made of an olive-tree branch is also clean unless it was first heated.","2628":"The sword, knife, dagger, spear, hand-sickle, harvest-sickle, clipper, and barbers\u2019 whose component parts were separated, are susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Yose says: the part that is near the hand is susceptible to impurity, but that which is near the top is clean. The two parts of shears which were separated: Rabbi Judah says: they are still susceptible to impurity; But the sages say that they are clean.","2629":"A koligrophon whose spoon has been removed is still susceptible to impurity on account of its teeth. If its teeth have been removed it is still susceptible on account of its spoon. A makhol whose spoon is missing is still susceptible to impurity on account of its point; If its point was missing it is still susceptible on account of its spoon. A stylus whose writing point is missing is still susceptible to impurity on account of its eraser; If its eraser is missing it is susceptible on account of its writing point. A zomalister whose spoon is lost is still susceptible to impurity on account of its fork; If its fork is missing, it is still susceptible on account of its spoon. So too with regard to the prong of a mattock. The minimum size for all these instruments: so that they can perform their usual work.","2630":"A harhur that is damaged is still susceptible to impurity until its greater part is removed. But if its shaft-socket is broken it is clean. A hatchet whose cutting edge is lost remains susceptible to impurity on account of its splitting edge. If its splitting edge is lost it remains susceptible on account of its cutting edge.

But the sages rule that it is clean. A saw whose teeth are missing one in every two is clean. But if a hasit length of consecutive teeth remained it is susceptible to impurity. An adze, scalpel, plane, or drill that was damaged remains susceptible to impurity, but if its steel edge was missing it is clean.

The block of a plane by itself is clean.","2632":"A needle whose eye or point is missing is clean. If he adapted it to be a stretching-pin it is susceptible to impurity. A pack-needle whose eye was missing is still susceptible to impurity since one writes with it. If its point was missing it is clean. A stretching-pin is in either case susceptible to impurity. A needle that has become rusty: If this hinders it from sewing it is clean, But if not it remains susceptible to impurity. A hook that was straightened out is clean. If it is bent back it resumes its susceptibility to impurity.","2633":"Wood that serves a metal vessel is susceptible to impurity, but metal that serves a wooden vessel is clean. How so?  If a lock is of wood and its clutches are of metal, even if only one of them is so, it is susceptible to impurity, but if the lock is of metal and its clutches are of wood, it is clean. If a ring was of metal and its seal of coral, it is susceptible to impurity, but if the ring was of coral and its seal of metal, it is clean. The tooth in the plate of a lock or in a key is susceptible to impurity by itself.","2634":"If Ashkelon grappling-irons were broken but their hooks remained, they remain susceptible to impurity. If a pitch-fork, winnowing-fan, or rake, and the same applies to a hair-comb, lost one of its teeth and it was replaced by one of metal, it is susceptible to impurity. And concerning all these Rabbi Joshua said: the scribes have here introduced a new principle of law, and I have no explanation to offer.","2635":"A flax-comb: if the teeth were missing but two remained, it is still susceptible to impurity. If only one remained it is clean. As regards all the teeth, each one individually is susceptible to impurity. A wool-comb: if one tooth out of every two is missing it is clean. If three consecutive teeth remained, it is susceptible to impurity. If the outermost tooth was one of them, the comb is clean.

Even if only one was removed but it was adapted to be used for a lamp or as a stretching-pin, it is susceptible to impurity.","2636":"What is the minimum size of broken metal vessels for them to be susceptible to impurity? A bucket must be of such a size as to draw water with it. A kettle must be such as water can be heated in it. A boiler, such as can hold selas. A cauldron, such as can hold jugs. Jugs, such as can hold perutahs. Wine-measures, such as can measure wine; and oil-measures, such as can measure oil. Rabbi Eliezer says: the size for all these is such as can hold perutahs. Rabbi Akiva says: a vessel that lacks trimming is susceptible to impurity, but one that lacks polishing is clean.","2637":"A staff to the end of which he attached a nail like an axe is susceptible to impurity. If the staff was studded with nails it is susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Shimon ruled: only if he put in three rows. In all cases where he put them in as ornamentation the staff is clean. If he attached a tube to its end, and so also in the case of a door, it is clean. If it was once an independent vessel and then it was fixed to the staff, it remains susceptible to impurity. When does it become pure? Bet Shammai says: when it is damaged; And Bet Hillel says: when it is joined on.","2638":"A builder's staff and a carpenter's axes are susceptible to impurity.

A broken mirror, if it does not reflect the greater part of the face, is clean.","2642":"Metal vessels remain unclean and become clean even when broken, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Joshua says: they can be made clean only when they are whole. How so? If they were sprinkled upon and on the same day they were broken and then they were recast and sprinkled upon on the same day, they are clean, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Joshua says: there can be no effective sprinkling earlier than on the third and the seventh day.","2643":"A knee-shaped key that was broken off at the knee is clean. Rabbi Judah says that it is unclean because one can open with it from within. A gamma-shaped key that was broken off at its shorter arm is clean. If it retained the teeth and the gaps it remains unclean. If the teeth were missing it is still unclean on account of the gaps; if the gaps were blocked up it is unclean on account of the teeth.

If in a mustard-strainer three holes in its bottom were merged into one another the strainer is clean. A metal mill-funnel is unclean.","2644":"Vessels of wood, leather, bone or glass: those that are flat are clean and those that form a receptacle are susceptible to impurity.

A chest, a box, a cupboard, a straw basket, a reed basket, or the tank of an Alexandrian ship, that have flat bottoms and can hold a minimum of forty se'ah in liquid measure which represent two kor in dry measure, are clean. All other vessels whether they can contain the minimum or cannot contain it, are susceptible to impurity, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: the tub of a wagon, the food chests of kings, the tanners trough, the tank of a small ship, and an ark, even though they are able to contain the minimum,  are susceptible to impurity, since they are intended to be moved about with their contents. As to all other vessels, those that can contain the minimum are clean and those that cannot contain it are susceptible to impurity. There is no difference between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Judah except a baking trough which belongs to a householder.","2645":"Bakers\u2019 baking-boards are susceptible to impurity, but those used by householders are clean.

But the sages say: all hangers are clean, excepting those of a sifter of flour-dealers, of a sieve used in threshing-floors, of a hand-sickle and of a detective's staff, since they aid when the instrument is in use.

All liquids are susceptible to impurity, but the liquids in the Temple slaughtering house are clean. All scrolls convey impurity to the hands, excepting the scroll of the Temple courtyard. A wooden toy horse is clean. The belly-lute, the donkey-shaped musical instrument and the erus are susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Judah says: the erus is susceptible to sitting impurity since the wailing woman sits on it. A weasel-trap is susceptible to impurity, but a mouse- trap is clean.","2650":"A wooden vessel that was broken into two parts becomes clean, except for a folding table, a dish with compartments for different kinds of food, and a householder's footstool. Rabbi Judah says: a double dish and a Babylonian drinking vessel are subject to the same law. When do wooden vessels begin to be susceptible to impurity? A bed and a cot, after they are sanded with fishskin. If the owner determined not to sand them over they are susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Meir says: a bed becomes susceptible to impurity as soon as three rows of meshes have been knitted in it.","2651":"Wooden baskets become susceptible to impurity as soon as their rims are rounded off and their rough ends are smoothed off. But those that are made of palm-branches become susceptible to impurity even though their ends were not smoothed off on the inside, since they are allowed to remain in this condition. A basket of reed-grass becomes susceptible to impurity as soon as its rim is rounded off, its rough ends are smoothed off, and its hanger is finished. A wicker basket flasks or for cups is susceptible to impurity even if the rough ends were not smoothed off on the inside, since these are allowed to remain in this condition.","2652":"Small reed baskets and baskets become susceptible to impurity as soon as their rims are rounded off and their rough ends are smoothed off. Large reed baskets and large hampers, as soon as two rows have been made round their sides. The container of a sifter or a sieve and a cup of the balances, as soon as one circling band has been made round their sides. A willow basket, as soon as two twists have been made around its wide sides. And a rush basket, as soon as one twist has been made round it.","2653":"When do leather vessels become susceptible to impurity?A leather pouch, as soon as its hem has been stitched, its rough ends trimmed and its straps sewn on. Rabbi Judah says: so soon as its ears have been sewn on. A leather apron  becomes susceptible to  impurity as soon as its hem has been stitched, its rough end trimmed and its strings sewn on. Rabbi Judah says: as soon as its loops  have been sewn on. A leather bed cover becomes susceptible as soon as its hem has been stitched and its rough ends trimmed. Rabbi Judah says:  as soon as its straps have been sewn on. A leather cushion or mattress becomes susceptible as soon as its hem has been stitched  and its rough ends trimmed. Rabbi Judah says: as it has been sew up and less than five handbreadths remained open.","2654":"A basket for figs is susceptible to uncleanness but a basket for wheat is clean. Small baskets made of leaves are clean, but those made of branches are susceptible to uncleanness. The palm wrapping in which dates are left and into which they can be easily put     and from which they can easily be taken out is susceptible to uncleanness, but if this cannot be done without tearing it or undoing it, it is clean.","2655":"The leather glove of winnowers, travelers, or flax workers is susceptible to uncleanness. But the one for dyers or blacksmiths is clean. Rabbi Yose says: the same law applies to the glove of grist dealers.

This is the general rule which Rabbi Yose stated: all objects that serve as a protection to objects that a man uses, both when the latter are in use and when they are not in use, are susceptible to uncleanness; but those that serve them as a  protection only when the latter are in use are clean.","2657":"The sheath of a sword, a knife or a dagger, the case for scissors, or shears or a razor, the case of make-up and the make-up box, the stylus case, the compass case, the tablet case, the case for a board,  a quiver and a javelin case     all these are susceptible to  uncleanness. The case for a double flute is susceptible to uncleanness if the instrument is put in from above, but if it is put in from the side it is clean. A case for flutes Rabbi Judah says it is clean because these are put in from the side. The covering of a club, a bow or a spear is clean. This is the general rule: that which serves as a case is susceptible to uncleanness, but that which is merely a covering is clean.","2658":"All wooden vessels that belong to householder become clean if the holes in them are the size of pomegranates. Rabbi Eliezer says: the size of the hole depends on what it is used for. Gardeners\u2019 vegetable baskets become clean if the holes in them are the size of bundles of vegetables. Baskets of householders become clean if the holes in them are the size of bundles of straws. Those of bath-keepers, if bundles of chaff will drop through. Rabbi Joshua says: in all these the size is that of pomegranates.","2659":"A skin bottle becomes clean if the holes in it are of a size through which warp-stoppers can fall out. If a warp-stopper cannot be held in, but it can still hold a woof-stopper it remains unclean. A dish holder that cannot hold dishes but can still hold trays remains unclean. A chamber- pot that cannot hold liquids but can still hold excrements remains unclean. Rabban Gamaliel rules that it is clean since people do not usually keep one that is in such a condition.","2660":"Bread-baskets become clean if the size of their hole is such that loaves of bread would fall through. Papyrus frames through into which reeds were inserted from the bottom upwards to strengthen them, are clean. If he fixed walls to it, they are susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Shimon says: if it cannot be lifted up by these walls it is clean.","2661":"The pomegranates of which they have spoken--three attached to one another. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: in a sifter or a sieve the size of the hole must be such that a pomegranate will drop out when one picks it up and walks about with it. In a basket it must be such as would allow a pomegranate to fall through while one hangs it behind him. And all other vessels which  cannot hold pomegranates as, for instance, the quarter kav measure and the half quarter kav measure, and small baskets, the size  of their holes must be such as would extend over the greater part of  them, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says: the size of their hole must be such that olives could fall through. If their sides were broken the size of their hole must be such as olives would drop through. If they are worn away the size must be such as would allow the objects which are usually kept in them to drop through.","2662":"The pomegranate of which they spoke refers to one that is neither small nor big but of moderate size. And why did they mention the pomegranates of Baddan? That whatever their quantity they cause other pomegranates to be forbidden, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said: to use them as a measure for holes in vessels. Rabbi Akiva said: they were mentioned for both reasons: that they are to be used as a measure for holes in vessels and that whatever their quantity they cause other pomegranates to be forbidden. Rabbi Yose said: the pomegranates of Baddan and the leeks of Geba were mentioned only to indicate that they must be tithed everywhere with certain tithe.","2663":"The egg of which they spoke it is one that is neither big nor small but of moderate size. Rabbi Judah says: the largest and the smallest  must be brought and put in water and the  displaced water is then divided. Rabbi Yose says: but who can tell me which is the largest and which is the smallest?  Rather, it all depends on the observer's estimate.","2664":"The dried fig of which they spoke--- it is one that is neither big nor small but of moderate size. Rabbi Judah says:  the biggest in the land of Israel is like one of medium size in other lands.","2665":"The olive of which they spoke it is one that is neither big nor small but of moderate size the egori. The barleycorn of which they spoke it is one that is neither big nor small but of moderate size the midbarit The lentil of which they spoke it is one that is neither big nor small but of moderate size--the egyptian kind. \"Any movable object conveys  uncleanness if it is of the thickness of an ox goad\" it is one that is neither big nor small but of moderate size. What is meant by \"one of moderate size?\" One whose circumference is just a handbreadth.","2666":"The cubit of which they spoke is one of  medium size. There were two standard cubits in Shushan Habirah, one in the north-eastern corner and the other in the south-eastern corner. The one in the north-eastern corner exceeded that of Moses  by half a fingerbreadth, while the one in the  south-eastern corner exceeded  the other by half a fingerbreadth, so that the latter exceeded that of Moses by a fingerbreadth. But why were there a larger and a smaller cubit? Only for this reason: so that craftsmen  might take their orders according to the smaller cubit and return their finished work according to the larger cubit,  so that they might not be guilty of any possible trespassing of Temple property.","2667":"Rabbi Meir says: all cubits  were of the moderate length  except that for the golden altar, the horns,  the surround  and the  base. Rabbi Judah says: the cubit used for the building  was one of six  handbreadths and that for the vessels one of five handbreadths.","2668":"Sometimes they stated a smaller measure: Liquid and dry measures  were measured with the Italian standard which was the one that was used in the wilderness. Sometimes they stated a measure that varied according to the individual concerned: One who takes the handful of a minhah, One who takes both hands full of incense, One who  drinks a cheek full on Yom Kippur, And the two meals for an eruv, The quantity being the food one eats on weekdays and not on Shabbat, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: as on Shabbat and not as on weekdays. And both intended to give the more lenient ruling. Rabbi Shimon says:   two thirds of a loaf, when three loaves are made of a kav. Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka says:  not less than a loaf that is purchased for a pundium when the price of wheat is four se'ah for a sela\u2019.","2669":"And sometimes  they stated a large measure:A ladleful of corpse mould  refers to the big ladle of physicians; The split bean in the case of skin disease  refers to the Cilician kind; One who eats on Yom Kippur a quantity of the bulk of a large date, refers to the size of the date and its pit; In the case of skins of wine and oil the holes   must be as big as their large stopper; In the case of a light hole that was not made by man's hands  the prescribed size of  which  is that of a large fist, the reference is to the fist of Ben Batiah Rabbi Yose said: and it is as big as a large human head. And in the case of one made by human hands the prescribed size  is that of the  large drill in the Temple chamber which is the size of the Italian pondium or the Neronian sela  or like the hole in a yoke.","2670":"All that live in the sea are clean, except the sea-dog because it seeks refuge on dry land, the words of Rabbi Akiba. If one made vessels from what grows in the sea and joined to them anything that grows on land, even if only a thread or a cord, if it is susceptible to uncleanness, they are unclean.","2671":"The laws of uncleanness can apply to what was created on the first day. There can be no uncleanness in what was created on the second day. The laws of uncleanness can apply to what was created on the third day. No there can be no uncleanness in what was created on the fourth day and on the fifth day, except for  the wing of the vulture or an ostrich-egg that is plated. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said:  why should the wing of a vulture be different from all other wings? The laws of uncleanness can apply to all that was created on the sixth day.","2672":"If one made a receptacle whatever its size it is susceptible to uncleanness. If one made a couch or a bed whatever its purpose it is susceptible to uncleanness. If one made a wallet from untanned hide or from papyrus it is susceptible to uncleanness. A pomegranate, an acorn and a nut which children hollowed out to  measure dust or fashioned them into a pair of scales, are susceptible to uncleanness, since in the case of children an act is valid though an intention is not.","2673":"The beam of a balance and a leveler that contain a  receptacle for metal, carrying-stick that has a receptacle for  money, a beggar's cane that has a receptacle for water, and a stick that has a receptacle for a mezuzah and for pearls are susceptible  to uncleanness. About all these Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai said: Oy to me if I should mention them, Oy to me if I don't mention them.","2674":"The base of the goldsmiths\u2019 anvil is susceptible to uncleanness, but that of the blacksmiths is clean. A whetting-board which has a receptacle for oil is susceptible to uncleanness, but one that has none is clean. A writing-tablet that has a receptacle for wax is susceptible to uncleanness, but one that has none is clean. A straw  mat or a tube of straw: Rabbi Akiva rules it is susceptible to uncleanness; But Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri rules that is it clean. Rabbi Shimon says: the hollow stalk of colocynth  is subject to the same law. A mat of reeds or rushes is clean. A reed-tube that was cut for holding anything remains clean until all the pith has been removed.","2675":"A wooden chest: Beth Shammai says: it is measured on the  inside; And Bet Hillel says: on the outside. Both agree that the thickness of the legs and the thickness of the rim are not included in the measurement. Rabbi Yose says: both agree that the thickness of the legs and the thickness of the rim are included in the measurement, but the space between them is not included. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri ruled: if the legs are one handbreadth high the space between them is not included in the measurement, otherwise it is included.","2676":"Its carriage: if it can be slipped off, is not regarded as connected, nor is it included in its measurement, nor does it afford protection together with it in the tent of a corpse, nor may it be drawn along on Shabbat if it contains money. If it cannot be slipped off, it is regarded as connected, it is included in its measurement, it affords protection together with it in the tent of a corpse, it may be drawn along on Shabbat even if it contains money. Its arched top, if it is fixed to the box, is considered connected and is measured with it, but if it is not fixed it is not connected and is not measured with it. How is it measured? As an ox-head. Rabbi Judah says: if it cannot stand by itself it is clean.","2677":"If one of the legs was missing from a chest, a box or a cupboard, even though it is still capable of holding things, it is clean, since it cannot hold things in the usual manner. But Rabbi Yose says: it is susceptible to impurity. The poles of a bed, its base, and its covering are clean. Only the bed itself and its rectangle frame are susceptible to uncleanness. The rectangle frames of the Levites are clean.","2678":"A bed frame that was put on props: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Judah say it is susceptible to uncleanness. But Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon say that it is clean. Rabbi Yose said: Why is this different from the rectangle frames of the Levites which are clean?","2679":"A bed that had contracted midras uncleanness: If a short side was removed and its two legs still remains it is unclean. But if a long side and two legs were removed it becomes clean. Rabbi Nehemiah says: it is unclean. If two props at opposite corners were cut off, or if two legs at opposite corners were cut off, or if the bed was reduced to a level of less than a handbreadth, it becomes clean.","2680":"A bed that had contracted midras impurity:If a long side of it was broken and then he repaired it, it still retains its midras impurity. If the second side was also broke and then he repaired it, it becomes pure from midras impurity but is unclean by virtue of contact with midras. If before one could manage to repair the first side the second one broke, the bed becomes clean.","2681":"If a bed leg that had contracted midras uncleanness was joined to a bed, all the bed contracts midras uncleanness. If it was subsequently taken off, it retains its midras uncleanness while the bed is unclean from contact with midras. If a bed leg that was subject to a seven-day uncleanness was joined to a bed, all the bed contracts seven-day uncleanness. If it was subsequently taken off it remains subject to seven-day uncleanness while the bed is only subject to evening-uncleanness. If a leg that was subject to evening uncleanness was joined to a bed, all the bed contracts evening uncleanness. If it was subsequently taken off it is still subject to evening uncleanness while the bed becomes clean. The same law applies also to the prong of a mattock.","2682":"A tefillin box consisting of four vessels: if the first compartment was unloosed, and then he mended it, it retains its corpse uncleanness. So is it also the case with the second and the third. If he unloosed the fourth it becomes free from corpse uncleanness but it is still unclean from contact with corpse uncleanness. If he went back to the first compartment and unloosed and mended it, it remains unclean from contact. So also in the case of the second compartment. If he then unloosed the third compartment and mended it becomes clean, since the fourth is unclean from contact, and what is unclean from contact cannot convey uncleanness by contact.","2683":"A bed half of which was stolen or lost, or one which brothers or joint owners divided between themselves, becomes clean. If it was restored it is susceptible to uncleanness henceforth. A bed may contract uncleanness and be rendered clean when all its parts are bound together, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But the sages say: it can contract uncleanness and is rendered clean in single parts.","2684":"One who dismantles a bed in order that he might immerse it and while doing so touches the ropes remains clean. When does the rope begin to constitute a connective with the bed? As soon as three rows of meshes of it have been knotted. And if another rope was tied to this one and a person touches it: If from the knot inwards he becomes unclean; But if from the knot outwards he remains clean. As to the loose ends of the knot, any one that touches that part which is needed for it  becomes unclean. And how much is needed for it?  Rabbi Judah says: three fingerbreadths.","2685":"A rope that hangs out from a bed:If it is shorter than five handbreadths, it is clean, If it is from five to ten handbreadths long, it is unclean. From ten handbreadths and longer is clean; For it is with this rope  that paschal lambs were tied  and beds were lowered down.","2686":"If a part of a mattress hangs over, it is unclean whatever  its length, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says: only that which is shorter than ten handbreadths. The remnant of a mattress remains unclean if the length is at least seven handbreadths from which a donkey's covering can be made.","2687":"If a zav was carried on a bed and on its mattress, the latter causes an uncleanness of two grades and an unfitness of one grade, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says: if a zav was carried on a bed and on its mattress the part that is shorter than ten handbreadths causes an  uncleanness of two grades and an unfitness of one grade, but that which is over the ten handbreadths causes only an uncleanness of one grade and an unfitness of one grade. If he was carried on the mattress, on the overhanging part that was shorter than ten handbreadths, it becomes unclean, but if on the part that was longer than ten handbreadths it remains clean.","2688":"If around a bed that had contracted midras uncleanness one wrapped a mattress, the whole becomes subject to midras uncleanness. If it was removed, the bed remains subject to midras uncleanness but the mattress is unclean only from contact with midras. If around a bed that had contracted seven-day uncleanness one wrapped a mattress, the whole becomes subject to seven-day uncleanness. If it was removed, the bed remains subject to seven-day uncleanness but the mattress is unclean until the evening. If the bed was subject to evening uncleanness and around it he wrapped a mattress, the whole becomes subject to evening uncleanness; If it was removed, the bed remains subject to evening uncleanness but the mattress becomes clean.","2689":"If a mattress was wrapped around a bed and a corpse touched them, they are subject to a seven-day uncleanness; If they are taken apart they are still subject to a seven-day uncleanness. If  a sheretz touched them they are subject to an evening uncleanness; If they are taken apart they are still subject to evening uncleanness. A bed from which the two longer sides were removed  and  two new ones were prepared for it but the original sockets were not changed: If the new sides were broken the bed retains its uncleanness, But if the old ones were broken it becomes clean, since all depends on the old ones.","2690":"A box whose opening is at the top is susceptible to corpse uncleanness. If a piece fell out above it is still susceptible to corpse uncleanness. If it was damaged below, it becomes clean. The compartments within it remain unclean and are not regarded as a connected to it.","2691":"If a shepherd's bag was damaged, the pocket within it retains its uncleanness and is not regarded as a connected to it. A skin whose testicle bags serve also as receptacles and they were damaged, they become clean, since they will no longer serve their original purpose.","2692":"A box whose opening is at the side is susceptible to both midras uncleanness  and corpse uncleanness. Rabbi Yose said: When does this apply? When it is less than ten handbreadths in height or when it does not have a rim one handbreadth deep. If it was damaged above it is still susceptible to corpse uncleanness. If it was damaged below: Rabbi Meir rules that it is susceptible to uncleanness. But the sages rule that it is clean because if the primary function ceases the secondary one also ceases.","2693":"A dung-basket that was so damaged that it will not hold pomegranates: Rabbi Meir says is still susceptible to uncleanness, But the sages say that it is clean because if the primary function ceases the secondary one also ceases.","2694":"Pillows, bed coverings, sacks and packing cases that were damaged are still susceptible to midras uncleanness. A fodder-bag that can hold four kav, a shepherd's bag that can hold five kav, a  traveling bag that can hold a se'ah, a skin that can hold seven kav, Rabbi Judah adds: also a spice-bag, and a food wallet that can hold the smallest quantity are susceptible to midras uncleanness. If any of them was damaged it becomes clean, since if the primary function   ceases the secondary function   also ceases.","2695":"A bagpipe is not susceptible to midras uncleanness. A trough for mixing mortar: Bet Shammai says: it is susceptible to midras uncleanness , And Bet Hillel says it is susceptible to corpse  uncleanness only. If a trough of a capacity from two log to nine kav is split, it becomes susceptible to midras uncleanness. If he left it out in the rain and it swelled   it is susceptible to corpse uncleanness alone. If he left it out during the east wind and it split, it is susceptible to midras uncleanness. In this respect the law is stricter in the case of remnants of wooden vessels than in that of such vessels in their original condition. It is also stricter in regard to the remnants of wicker vessels than to such vessels as are in their original condition, for when they are in their original condition they are insusceptible to uncleanness until their rim is finished, but after their rim has been finished, even though their edges fell away leaving only the slightest trace of them, they are unclean.","2696":"If a stick was used as a handle for a hatchet, it is regarded as connected for uncleanness at the time of use. A yarn winder is regarded as connected for uncleanness at the time of its use. If it was fixed to a pole it is susceptible to uncleanness, but it is not considered connected to it. If the pole itself was converted into a yarn winder, only that part which is needed for use is susceptible to uncleanness. A seat that was fixed to the pole is susceptible to uncleanness, but the latter is not regarded as connected to it. If the pole itself was turned into a seat, only the place of the seat is susceptible to uncleanness. A seat that was fixed to the beam of an olive-press is susceptible to uncleanness, but it is not connected to it. If the end of a beam was turned into a seat it remains clean, because people would tell him, \"Get up and let us do our work.\"","2697":"If a large trough was so damaged that it could no longer hold pomegranates and he fixed it to be used as a seat: Rabbi Akiva says that it is susceptible to uncleanness, But the sages say that it remains clean unless its rough parts have been smoothed. If it was turned into a feeding bowl for cattle, even if it was fixed to a wall, it is susceptible to uncleanness.","2698":"A wood block  that was fixed to a row on a wall, whether he fixed it and did not built upon it or built upon it but did not fix it, it is susceptible to uncleanness. If he fixed it and also built upon, it is clean. Matting that was spread over the roof-beams, whether he fixed it but did not put on the plasterwork or whether he put on the plasterwork but did not fix it, it is susceptible to uncleanness. If it was fixed and he laid plasterwork over it, it is clean. A dish that was fixed to a chest, box or cupboard: If in such a manner as to hold its contents in the usual way, it is susceptible to uncleanness, But if it was in a manner that it cannot hold its contents in the usual way  it is clean.","2699":"If a sheet that was susceptible to midras uncleanness made into a curtain, it becomes clean from midras uncleanness but it is still susceptible to corpse uncleanness. When does it become insusceptible to midras uncleanness? Bet Shammai says: when the loops have been tied to it.  . Bet Hillel says:  when it has been attached. Rabbi Akiva says: when it has been fixed.","2700":"A mat whose reeds stretched lengthwise is insusceptible to uncleanness; But the sages rule: only if they lay in the shape of the Greek letter chi. If they were laid along its width and there was a distance of less than four handbreadths between the two reeds, it is insusceptible to uncleanness. If it was divided along its width, Rabbi Judah rules that is clean. So also, where the end-knots  are untied, it is clean. If it was divided along its length but three end-knots remained intact across a stretch of six handbreadths, it is susceptible to uncleanness. When does a mat become susceptible to uncleanness? When its rough ends are trimmed, this being the completion of its manufacture.","2701":"One who touches the upper beam, the lower beam, the harnesses, the sley, the thread that is drawn over purple material, or a spool which is not to be shot back, remains clean. If he touches the woof, the standing warp, the double thread that is drawn over purple material or a spool which is to be shot back, he becomes unclean. If one touches the wool that is on the distaff, or on the spool, he remains clean. If he touches the spinner: Before it was uncovered  he is unclean, After it was uncovered   he remains clean.","2702":"One who touches the yoke, the crossbar, the collar-piece, or the thick ropes, even when they are being used, he remains clean. If he touched the tail piece, knee or handle, he becomes unclean. If he touched the metal rings, the guides, or the flanks, he becomes unclean. Rabbi Judah says that he remains clean if he touched the guides since they only serve to increase the soil.","2703":"One who touches the handle of a saw at either end  becomes unclean; If he touched its string, cord, cross-piece or side-pieces, a carpenter's vice, or the bow-handle of a bow-drill, he remains clean. Rabbi Judah says: so too he who touches the frame of a large saw remains clean. One who touches the bow-string or the bow, even though it was stretched, he remains clean. A mole-trap is clean. Rabbi Judah says: when it is stretched, the separate parts are regarded as connected.","2704":"If a table or a side-board was damaged or he covered them with marble but room was left for cups to be set, it is unclean. Rabbi Judah ruled: there must be room enough for pieces of food.","2705":"A table one of whose legs was removed is clean. If a second leg was removed it is still clean. But if a third was removed it becomes unclean where the owner has the intention of using it. Rabbi Yose says: no intention is necessary. The same law applies also to the side-board.","2706":"A bench, one of whose legs was removed, is clean. If its second leg also was removed it is still clean. If it was one handbreadth high it is unclean. A footstool one of whose legs was removed is unclean. The same applies to the stool in front of a cathedra.","2707":"A bride's stool which lost the coverings for the seatboards: Bet Shammai rules that it still susceptible to uncleanness, And Bet Hillel rules that it is clean. Shammai rules: even the frame of the stool  is susceptible to uncleanness. A stool which was fixed to a kneading-trough, Bet Shammai rules that it susceptible to uncleanness, And Bet Hillel rules that it is clean. Shammai rules: even one made out of it is susceptible to uncleanness.","2708":"A chair whose seat boards did not project and then they were removed, it is still susceptible to uncleanness, for it is usual  to turn it on its side and to sit on it.","2709":"A chair whose middle seat board was removed but the outer ones  remained, it is still susceptible to uncleanness. If the outer ones were removed and the middle seat board remained it is also  susceptible to uncleanness. Rabbi Shimon says: only if it was a handbreadth wide.","2710":"A chair, of which two seat boards were removed, this one next to this one: Rabbi Akiva says: it is susceptible to impurity; And the sages say that it is clean. Rabbi Judah said: so too if the seat boards of a bride's chair were lost, though the receptacle under remained, it is clean, since where the primary function has ceased,  the secondary one  also ceases.","2711":"A chest whose top part was removed is still susceptible to uncleanness on account of its bottom; If its bottom was removed it is still susceptible to uncleanness on account of its top part. If both the top part and the bottom part were removed: Rabbi Judah says that it is susceptible to uncleanness on account of its sides, But the sages rule that it is clean. A stonecutter's seat is subject to midras uncleanness.","2712":"A wooden block which was painted red or saffron, or was polished: Rabbi Akiva says that it is susceptible to uncleanness, But the sages say that it remains clean unless a seat was carved out.

But if it was plaited over with reed-grass or with a cord it becomes susceptible to uncleanness.","2713":"A toilet is subject to both midras and corpse uncleanness. If the leather seat was separated, the leather is subject to midras uncleanness and the iron is subject only to corpse uncleanness. A folding stool whose cover is of leather is subject to both midras and corpse uncleanness. If it was taken apart, the leather is subject to midras uncleanness while the stool is altogether clean. A bath-house bench that has two wooden legs is susceptible to uncleanness. If one leg was of wood and the other of stone it is clean. Boards in a bath-house which were joined together: Rabbi Akiva says that they are susceptible to midras uncleanness; But the sages say that they are clean, since they are made only for the water to flow under them. A fumigation-cage that contains a receptacle for garments is susceptible to uncleanness, But one that is made like a bee-hive is clean.","2714":"If a ball, a mould, an amulet or tefillin were torn, one that touches them becomes unclean, But one that touches what is inside them remains clean. If a saddle was torn, one that touches its contents unclean, because the stitching joins them.","2715":"The following are susceptible to uncleanness as objects that are fit for riding upon (merkav): an Ashkelon donkey belt, a Medean saddle, a camel's pillow, and a horse-cloth. Rabbi Yose says: a horse-cloth is susceptible to uncleanness  as a seat, since people stand on it  in the arena. But a saddle of a female camel is susceptible to sitting uncleanness.","2716":"What is the practical difference between the uncleanness of an object used for riding upon and one used for sitting upon? In the case of the former the effect of contact with it is different from the effect of carrying it, but in the case of the latter there is no difference between the effect of coming in contact with it or carrying it. The pack-frame of a donkey on which a zav sat is clean; But if the size of the spaces has been changed or if they have been broken one into another it is susceptible to uncleanness.","2717":"A bier, the mattress and the pillow of a corpse are susceptible to the uncleanness of midras. A bride's stool, a midwife's stool, and a launderer's stool on which he piles the clothes: Rabbi Yose says: it is not regarded as a seat.","2718":"A fishing net is susceptible to uncleanness on account of its bag. Nets, snares, bird-traps, slings and fishermen's skeins are susceptible to uncleanness. A fish-trap, a bird-basket and a bird-cage are not susceptible to uncleanness.","2719":"There are three different types of shields:A bent shield  is susceptible to midras uncleanness; A shield used in the arena is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; And the Arabian toy shield is pure from all uncleanness.","2720":"There are three different types of wagons:The one made like a cathedra  is susceptible to midras uncleanness; The one made like a bed is susceptible to corpse uncleanness, And the one for the transport of stones is free from all uncleanness.","2721":"There are three different types of baking-troughs:If a baking-trough of a capacity from two log to nine kav was split  it is  susceptible to midras uncleanness; If it was whole it is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; And if it holds the prescribed measure it is free  from all uncleanness.","2722":"There are three different types of boxes:A box whose opening is at the sides  is susceptible to midras uncleanness; If it is on the top it is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; And if it holds the prescribed measure it is free from all uncleanness.","2723":"There are three different types of leather covers:That of barbers is susceptible to midras uncleanness; That on which people eat is susceptible to corpse uncleanness. And that for spreading out olives is free from all uncleanness.","2724":"There are three different types of bases:One which lies before a bed or before a scribe is susceptible to midras uncleanness; One for a side-table is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; And one for a cupboard is free from all uncleanness.","2725":"There are three different types of writing tablets:That of papyrus  is susceptible to midras uncleanness; That which had a receptacle for wax is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; And that which is smooth is free from all uncleanness.","2726":"There are three different types of beds:One that is used for lying upon is susceptible to midras uncleanness; One used by glass makers is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; And one used by weavers is free from all uncleanness.","2727":"There are three different types of baskets:The one for dung  is susceptible to midras uncleanness; The one for straw is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; And a camel's rope bag is free from all uncleanness.","2728":"There are three different types of mats:One used for sitting upon is susceptible to midras uncleanness; One used by dyers is susceptible to corpse uncleanness. And one used in wine-presses is free from all uncleanness.","2729":"There are three different types of water skins and three different types of shepherds' wallets:Those that can hold the  prescribed quantity  are susceptible to midras uncleanness; Those that cannot hold the prescribed quantity are susceptible to corpse  uncleanness; And those made of fish skin are free from all uncleanness.","2730":"There are three different types of hides:That which is used as a rug is susceptible to midras uncleanness; That which is used as a wrapper for vessels is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; And that which is intended for straps and sandals is free from all uncleanness.","2731":"There are three different types of sheets:One used for lying upon is susceptible to midras uncleanness; One used as a curtain is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; And one used as a mural decoration is free from all uncleanness.","2732":"There are three different types of napkins:One used for hands is susceptible to midras uncleanness; One used for books is susceptible to corpse uncleanness; And the one used as a shroud or a covering for the harps of the Levites is free from all uncleanness.","2733":"There are three different types of hip-boots:Those used by the hunters of animals and birds are susceptible to midras uncleanness; Those used by locust gatherers are susceptible to corpse uncleanness.

Rabbi Shimon says: if the cup of a balance was patched on to the bottom of a boiler on the inside, the latter becomes unclean; but if on the outside it remains clean. If it was patched on to the side, whether on the inside or the outside, it remains clean.","2736":"All vessels have different laws for outer and inner sides, as for instance, cushions, coverings, sacks and packing-bags, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir says: any vessel that has loops has different laws for inner and outer sides   but one that has no loops does not have different laws for outer and inner sides. A table and a side-board  have different laws for outer and inner sides, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir says: they do not have a different law for their outer sides. The same applies to a frame.","2737":"An ox-goad has different laws for its outer and inner parts, The outer part is the seven handbreadths from the broad blade and four handbreadths from the point, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir says: it is not to subject to such distinction,  the four and the seven handbreadths were mentioned only in regard to its remnants.","2738":"Measures of wine or oil, a fork-ladle, a mustard-strainer and a wine-filter have an outer and inner side, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: they do not have. Rabbi Shimon says: they do have, for if their outer parts contracted uncleanness that which is inside remains clean, and immersion is required.","2739":"If in a measure consisting of a quarter of a log and half a quarter of a log the quarter measure contracted uncleanness, the half-quarter measure does not become unclean, and if the half-quarter contracted uncleanness the quarter does not become unclean. They argued before Rabbi Akiva:  since the half quarter measure is the outer part of the quarter measure, should not the outer side of the vessel whose inner side contracted uncleanness become unclean? He answered them: Are you sure that it belongs to the category of vessels that have inner and outer parts? Perhaps the quarter is to be regarded as the outer side of the half quarter and, surely, the inner side of a vessel does not become unclean if the outer side contracted uncleanness.","2740":"If the inside of the quarter contracted uncleanness, the quarter and its outer side are unclean, but the half quarter and its outer side remain clean. If the inside of the half quarter contracted uncleanness, the half quarter and its outer side are unclean, but the quarter and its outer side remain clean. If the outer side of the quarter contracted uncleanness,the outer side of the half quarter remains clean, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: the outer side cannot be divided. When he immerses the vessel, he must immerse the whole thing.","2741":"The bases, rims, hangers or handles of vessels that have a receptacle upon which an unclean liquid fell, one dries them and they remain clean. But if unclean liquid fell on any part of any other vessel which cannot hold pomegranates (or in which no distinction is made between its outer and inner sides), the whole becomes unclean. If the outer side of a vessel contracted uncleanness from a liquid, only its outer side is unclean but its inner side, rim, hanger and handles remain clean. If its inner side contracted uncleanness the whole is unclean.","2742":"All vessels have outer and inner sides and have a part by which they are held. Rabbi Tarfon says: this applies only to a large wooden kneading trough. Rabbi Akiva says: it applies to cups. Rabbi Meir says: it applies to unclean and clean hands. Rabbi Yose says: they said this only concerning clean hands.","2743":"How so?If one's hands were clean and the outer side of a cup was unclean, one may hold it by its holding-place and need not be concerned lest his hands have contracted uncleanness from the outer side of the cup. If one was drinking from a cup whose outer side was unclean he need not be concerned lest the liquid in his mouth contracted uncleanness from the outer side of the cup and that it then conveyed uncleanness to the cup. If a kettle was boiling one need not be concerned lest liquid should come out from it and touch its outer side and return again within it.","2744":"Holy vessels do not have outer and inner sides or a part by which they are held. One may not immerse vessels within one another for sacred use. All vessels become susceptible to uncleanness by intention, but they cannot be rendered insusceptible except by a change-effecting act, for an act annuls an earlier act as well as an earlier intention, but an intention annuls neither an earlier act nor an earlier intention.","2745":"An Imki sandal and a laced-up bag, Rabbi Judah says: also an Egyptian basket; Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says: also to a Lattakian sandal can be made susceptible to uncleanness  and again be made insusceptible  without the aid of a craftsman. Rabbi Yose said: But can't all vessels be made susceptible to uncleanness  and again insusceptible  without the aid of a craftsman? Rather, these, even when they are unlaced are susceptible to uncleanness since a layman is able to restore them. They spoke only of an Egyptian  basket  which even a craftsman cannot easily  restore.","2746":"A laced-up bag whose laces were removed is still susceptible to uncleanness; But if it was made flat it is pure. If a strip of cloth has been put on it below, it is susceptible. If a bag was within another bag and one of them became unclean from a liquid, the other does not become unclean. A pearl pouch is susceptible to uncleanness. A money pouch: Rabbi Eliezer says that it is susceptible to uncleanness, But the sages say that it is pure.","2747":"The hand-coverings of thorn-pickers are pure. A belt and leg guards are susceptible to uncleanness. Sleeves are susceptible to uncleanness. But hand-coverings are pure. All finger-coverings are pure except that of fig-pickers, since the latter holds the sumac berries. If it was torn, if it cannot hold the greater part of a sumac berry it is pure.","2748":"A sandal, one of whose holes was broken but was then fixed, retains its midras uncleanness. If a second hole was broken and it was fixed, it is free from midras uncleanness but is unclean from contact with midras. If the second hole was broken before the first could be mended, it is clean. If its heel was torn off, or if its toe-piece was removed, or if it was torn in two, it     becomes clean. A heel-less slipper that was torn anywhere becomes clean. A shoe that was damaged becomes clean if it cannot contain the greater part of the foot. A shoe that is still on the last: Rabbi Eliezer says: it is insusceptible to uncleanness, But the sages say that it is susceptible. All water skins whose holes have been tied up are insusceptible to uncleanness,     except for Arabian ones. Rabbi Meir says: if they are tied up for a while, they are clean; but if they are tied with a permanent knot they are unclean. Rabbi Yose says: all tied up water skins are clean.","2749":"The following hides are susceptible to midras uncleanness: A hide which he intended to use as a rug, A hide used as an apron, A hide used as the lower covering of a bed, A hide used by a donkey-driver, A hide used by a flax-worker, A hide used by a porter, A hide used by a doctor, A hide used for a crib, A hide put over a child's chest, A hide for a cushion. A hide for a covering. All these are susceptible to midras uncleanness. A hide for wrapping up combed wool and a hide worn by a wool-comber: Rabbi Eliezer says it is susceptible to midras, But the sages say that it is susceptible to corpse uncleanness only.","2750":"A bag or wrapper for garments is susceptible to midras. A bag or wrapper for purple wool: Bet Shammai says: it is susceptible to midras, But Bet Hillel says: it is susceptible only to corpse uncleanness. A hide which was made to be a covering for vessels is not susceptible to uncleanness, but for weights it is susceptible. Rabbi Yose says in the name of his father that it is pure.","2751":"Whenever no act is lacking, intention alone causes a vessel to be susceptible to uncleanness, But whenever an act is lacking, intention alone does not render it susceptible to uncleanness, except for a fur cover.","2752":"The hides of a householder become susceptible to uncleanness by intention, but those that belong to a tanner do not become susceptible by mere intention. Those taken by a thief become susceptible by intention, but those taken by a robber  do not become susceptible by mere intention. Rabbi Shimon says: the rule is to be reversed; those taken by a robber become susceptible by mere intention, but those taken by a thief  do not become susceptible by  intention, since in the latter case the owner does not abandon hope for recovery.","2753":"If a hide had contracted midras uncleanness and its owner then intended it to be used for straps or sandals, it becomes clean as soon as he put the knife to it, the words of Rabbi Judah. But the sages say: it does not become clean until he has reduced its size to less than five handbreadths. Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says: even if one made a napkin from a hide it remains unclean, But if he made one from a covering it becomes clean.","2754":"Cloth is susceptible to five categories of uncleanness; Sack-cloth is susceptible to four; Leather to three; Wood to two; And an earthenware vessel to one. An earthenware vessel is susceptible to uncleanness only as a receptacle; any earthen vessel that has no inner part is not susceptible to uncleanness from its outer part. Wood is subject to an additional form of uncleanness in that it is also susceptible to uncleanness   as a seat. Similarly a tablet which has no rim is susceptible to uncleanness if it is a wooden object and insusceptible if it is an earthenware one. Leather is susceptible to an additional form of uncleanness in that it is also susceptible to the uncleanness of a tent. Sack-cloth has an additional form of uncleanness in that it is susceptible to uncleanness as woven work. Cloth has an additional form of uncleanness in that it is susceptible to uncleanness when it is only three by three fingerbreadths.","2755":"Cloth is susceptible to midras uncleanness when it is three handbreadths by three handbreadths, and to corpse uncleanness when it is three fingerbreadths by three fingerbreadths. Sack-cloth when it is four handbreadths by four handbreadths. Leather, five handbreadths by five handbreadths. And matting, six handbreadths by six handbreadths. All of these are equally susceptible to both midras and corpse uncleanness. Rabbi Meir says: what remains of sack-cloth is susceptible to uncleanness if it is four handbreadths, but when in its first condition it becomes susceptible only after its manufacture is completed.","2756":"If one made up a piece of material from two handbreadths  of cloth and one of sack-cloth, or of three of sack-cloth and one of leather or four of leather and one of matting, it is not susceptible to  uncleanness. If the piece of material was made up of five handbreadths of matting and one of leather or four of leather and one of sack-cloth, or three of sack-cloth and one of cloth it is susceptible to uncleanness. This is the general rule: if the material added is subject to greater restrictions it is susceptible to uncleanness, but if the material added was subject to lesser restrictions     it is not susceptible.","2757":"If one cut off from any of these a piece one by one handbreadth it is susceptible to uncleanness. If one cut off a one by one handbreadth piece from the bottom of a basket it is susceptible to uncleanness. If one cut off from the sides of the basket: Rabbi Shimon says that it is not susceptible to uncleanness, But the sages say one who cuts off a square handbreadth from anywhere, it is susceptible to uncleanness.","2758":"Worn-out pieces of a sifter or a sieve that were adapted for use as a seat: Rabbi Akiva rules that they are susceptible to uncleanness, But the sages rule that they are not susceptible unless their rough ends were cut off. A child's stool that has legs, even though it is less than a handbreadth high, is susceptible to uncleanness. A child's shirt: Rabbi Eliezer rules it is susceptible to uncleanness at any size. But the sages rule: it is susceptible only if it is of the prescribed size, and it is measured when doubled over.","2759":"The following are measured when doubled: Felt socks, long stockings, pants, a cap and a money-belt. As regards a patch sewn on the hem, if it was simple it is measured simple, but if it was doubled it is measured when doubled.","2760":"If a piece of cloth was woven to the size of three by three handbreadths, and then it contracted midras uncleanness, and then he completed the rest of the piece, and then one removed a single thread from the original part, it  is free from midras uncleanness but is still unclean from contact with midras uncleanness. If he removed a thread from the original part and then he finished the whole cloth, it is still unclean from contact with midras uncleanness.","2761":"Similarly, if a piece of cloth was woven to the size of three fingerbreadths square, and it contracted corpse uncleanness, and afterwards he finished the entire piece, and then he removed a single thread from its original part, it is free from corpse uncleanness but is still unclean from contact with corpse uncleanness. If a thread was removed from the original part and then all the cloth was finished it remains clean, for the sages have ruled: if a piece of three fingerbreadths square is lessened it becomes clean. But if one of three handbreadths square is lessened, even though it is released from midras, it is still susceptible to all other forms of uncleanness.","2762":"If a sheet that had contracted midras uncleanness was made into a curtain, it is pure from midras uncleanness but is still unclean from contact with midras uncleanness. Rabbi Yose said: but what midras uncleanness has this touched! Only if a zav had  touched it  is it unclean from contact with a zav.","2763":"If a piece of cloth three handbreadths square was divided,  it is pure from midras uncleanness but is still unclean from contact with midras uncleanness. Rabbi Yose said: but what midras uncleanness has this touched! Only if a zav had  touched it  is it unclean from contact with a zav.","2764":"If a piece of cloth three handbreadths square was found in a rubbish heap it must  be both sound and capable of wrapping up salt; But if it was found in the house it need only be either sound or capable of wrapping up salt. How much salt must it be capable of wrapping up? A quarter of a kav. Rabbi Judah says: this refers to fine salt, But the sages stated: it refers to coarse salt. Both intended to be lenient. Rabbi Shimon says: the law concerning a piece of cloth three handbreadths square found in a rubbish heap is the same as that for a piece of cloth that was three fingerbreadths square in a house.","2765":"A piece of cloth three handbreadths square that was torn: if he put it on a chair, and his skin touches the chair, it is pure; And if not, it remains pure. A piece of cloth three fingerbreadths square one thread of which was worn away, or in which a knot was found, or in which two threads ran alongside each other, is pure. A piece of cloth three fingerbreadths square that was thrown on the rubbish heap becomes pure. If he brought it back, it it becomes susceptible to uncleanness. Throwing it away always renders it pure and taking it back renders it susceptible to uncleanness, except when it is of purple or fine crimson. Rabbi Eliezer says: a patch of new cloth is also subject to the same law. Rabbi Shimon says: all these materials become pure; they were mentioned only in connection with the return of lost property.","2766":"A piece of cloth three fingerbreadths square that was stuffed into a ball or was itself made into a ball is clean. But a piece of cloth three handbreadths square that was stuffed into a  ball remains unclean. If he made it into a ball itself, it is clean because the sewing reduces its size.","2767":"A piece of cloth less than three handbreadths square that was adapted for the purpose of stopping up a hole in a bath house, of emptying a cooking-pot  or of wiping with it the mill stones, whether it was or was not kept in readiness for any such use, is susceptible to uncleanness, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Joshua says: whether it was or was not kept in readiness it is pure. Rabbi Akiba ruled: if  it was kept in readiness it is susceptible, and if it was not kept in  readiness it is pure.","2768":"If a bandage is made of cloth or leather it is pure. A poultice is pure if it is on cloth, but if on leather it is susceptible. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: even if it was on cloth it remains susceptible to uncleanness because it can be shaken off.","2769":"Covers of scrolls, whether they are decorated or not, are susceptible to uncleanness according to the view of Bet Shammai. Bet Hillel says: those that are decorated are pure, but those that are not decorated are susceptible. Rabban Gamaliel says: both the former and the latter are pure.","2770":"If a head-wrap that had contracted midras uncleanness was wrapped around a scroll, it is released from midras uncleanness but it remains susceptible to corpse uncleanness. A skin that was made into a rug or a rug that was made into a skin becomes clean. A skin that was made into a shepherd's wallet or a shepherd's wallet that was made into a skin; Or a cushion cover that was made into a sheet or a sheet that was made into a cushion cover; Or a sheet cover that was made into a plain sheet or a plain sheet that was made into a sheet cover, remains unclean. This is the general rule: any object that has been changed into one of the same class  remains unclean, but if into one of another class it becomes clean.","2771":"If a patch was sewn on to a basket, it conveys one grade of uncleanness and one of unfitness. If it was separated from the basket, it conveys one grade of uncleanness and one of unfitness, but the patch becomes clean. If it was sewn on to cloth it conveys two grades of uncleanness and one of unfitness. If it was separated from the cloth, it conveys one grade of uncleanness and one of unfitness, while the patch conveys two grades of uncleanness and one of unfitness. The same law applies to a patch was sewn on to sacking or leather, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says that it is clean. Rabbi Yose says: if it was sewn on leather it becomes clean; but if on sacking it remains unclean, since the latter is a woven material.","2772":"The three square of which they have spoken do not include the hem, the words of Rabbi Shimon. But the sages say: exactly three fingerbreadths square. If a patch was sewn on to a cloth by one side only, it is not considered as connected. If it was sewn on by two opposite sides, it is considered connected. If it was sewn on the shape of a gamma: Rabbi Akiva says that the cloth is unclean, But the sages say that it is clean. Rabbi Judah stated: When does this apply? To a cloak, but in the case of an undershirt the patch is regarded as connected if it was sewn by its upper side, but if by its lower side it is not connected.","2773":"Poor men's clothes, though made up of pieces none of which is three fingerbreadths square are susceptible to midras uncleanness. If a cloak began to be torn, as soon as its greater part is torn the pieces are not regarded as connected. Exceptionally thick or thin materials are not governed by the prescribed minimum of three fingerbreadths square.","2774":"A porter's pad is susceptible to midras uncleanness. A wine filter is not susceptible to uncleanness as a seat. An old woman's hair-net is susceptible to uncleanness as a seat. A prostitute's shirt which is woven like a net is not susceptible to uncleanness. A garment made of fishing net is not susceptible to uncleanness, but one made of its bag is susceptible. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: if a garment is made out of a fishing net but is made double it is susceptible to uncleanness.","2775":"A hair-net that one began to make from its upper hem remains pure until its bottom section is finished. If one began from its bottom section, it remains pure until its hem is finished. Its head band is susceptible to uncleanness in itself. Its strings are susceptible to uncleanness because they are connected. A hair-net that is torn becomes pure if it cannot contain the greater part of the hair.","2776":"The fringe strings of a sheet, a scarf, a head-wrap and a felt cap are regarded as connected  up to a length of six fingerbreadths; Those of an undergarment up to ten fingerbreadths. The fringes of a thick wool cloak, a veil, a shirt, or a light cloak are regarded as connected up to a length of three fingerbreadths. The fringes of an old woman's head-wrap, of Arabian face wraps, of Cilician goat's-hair clothing, of a money-belt, of a turban or of a curtain are  regarded as connected whatever their length may be.","2777":"Three woolen pillow-covers, six linen ones, three sheets,  twelve handkerchiefs, two pant-sleeves, one shirt, one cloak, or one winter-cloak,  can be regarded as connected in respect of both uncleanness  and sprinkling. If they exceed this number they are regarded as connected in respect of uncleanness but not in respect of sprinkling. Rabbi Yose says: not even in respect of uncleanness.","2778":"The string of a common plumb-line is regarded as connected up to a length of twelve cubits; That of the carpenters\u2019 plumb-line, up to eighteen cubits; And that of the builders\u2019 plumb-line up to fifty cubits.

That of the plasterers: Bet Shammai says: nine handbreadths And Bet Hillel says: ten handbreadths. Any parts exceeding these lengths, if he wanted to retain it, is also susceptible to uncleanness. The shafts of fire instruments are susceptible to uncleanness whatsoever their length.","2784":"Glass vessels--those that are flat are pure and those that have receptacles are susceptible. After they are broken they become clean. If he again made vessels of them they become susceptible to uncleanness from that point and onward. A glass tray or a flat dish is pure.

If it was polished or scraped with a file it becomes susceptible to  uncleanness.","2785":"A mirror is pure. A tray that was made into a mirror remains susceptible, but if it was originally made to serve as a mirror it is pure.

But Bet Hillel say: the liquids that fall down come under the law of \u2018if water be put\u2019, but the liquids that remain on the tree do not come under the law of \u2018if water be put,' because his intention was that the liquids should drop down from all the tree.","2790":"If one shook a tree  and it fell on another tree, or a branch and it fell on another branch, and under them were seeds or vegetables still joined to the ground: Bet Shammai say: this comes under the law of \u2018if water be put\u2019.

Joshua said in the name of Abba Yose Holikofri a man of Tivon:   Be surprised if there is any liquid that according to the Torah causes susceptibility to uncleanness except one put it on with intention, for it is said: \"If water be put upon the seed.\"","2791":"If one shook a bundle of vegetables and water dropped down from the upper side to the lower side: Bet Shammai say: this comes under the law of \u2018if water be put\u2019. But Bet Hillel say: this does not come under the law of \u2018if water be put\u2019. Bet Hillel said to Bet Shammai: if one shakes a stalk, do we fear lest water drops from one leaf on the other leaf? Bet Shammai said to them: a stalk is only one, but a bundle has many stalks. Bet Hillel said to them: behold, if one lifted a sack full of produce and put it beside the river, do we fear lest water drops from the upper side to the lower side? But if he lifted two sacks and placed them one upon the other, the lower sack comes   under the law of \u2018if water be put\u2019. Rabbi Yose says: the lower sack remains insusceptible to uncleanness.","2792":"If one rubbed a leek or pressed his hair or his garment, Rabbi Yose says: the liquid which came out comes under the law of \u2018if water be put\u2019, but the liquid that remained does not come under the law of \u2018if water be put\u2019, because his intention was that the liquid should come out of all of it.","2793":"If one blew on lentils in order to test whether they were good: Rabbi Shimon says: this does not come under the law of \u2018if water be put\u2019. But the sages say: this does come under the law of \u2018if water be put\u2019. If one ate sesame with his finger, with regard to the liquid that was on his hand: Rabbi Shimon says: this does not come under the law of \u2018if water be put\u2019. But the sages say: this does come under the law of \u2018if water be put\u2019. If one hid his fruit in water from thieves, it does not come  under the law of \u2018if water be put\u2019. Once it happened that the men of Jerusalem hid their fig cakes in water from the robbers, and the sages declared that they were not susceptible to uncleanness. If one put his fruit in the stream of a river to make it come down with him, it does not come under the law of \u2018if water be put\u2019.","2794":"The sweat of houses, of cisterns, of ditches and caverns does not cause  susceptibility to uncleanness. A man's perspiration does not cause susceptibility to uncleanness. If a man drank unclean water and perspired, his perspiration does not cause susceptibility to uncleanness. If he entered into drawn water and perspired, his perspiration causes susceptibility to uncleanness. If he dried himself and then perspired, his perspiration does not cause susceptibility to uncleanness.","2795":"The sweat of an unclean bath is unclean, But that of a clean bath comes under the law of \u2018if water be put\u2019. If there was a pool in a house, the house sweats because of it if the pool was unclean, the sweat of all the house which was caused by the pool is unclean.","2796":"Two pools, the one clean and the other unclean: The sweat near the unclean pool is unclean, And the sweat near the clean pool is clean, And what is at equal distance from both pools is unclean. Unclean iron was smelted with clean iron: If the greater part came from the unclean iron, it is unclean; If the greater part came from the clean iron, it is clean; But if there was half of each, it is unclean. Pots owned by Israelites and non-Jews used for passing water: If the greater part is from the unclean urine, it is unclean; If the greater part is from the clean urine, it is clean; But if there was half of each, it is unclean. Waste-water, in which rain had fallen: If the greater part consisted of the unclean water, it is unclean; If the greater part consisted of clean water, it is clean; But if there was half of each, it is unclean. When is this the case? When the waste-water came first; but if the rain water came before the waste-water, it is unclean whatever the quantity of the rain water.","2797":"If one flattened out his roof or washed his garment and rain came down upon it: If the greater part consisted of the unclean water, it is unclean; If the greater part consisted of the clean water, it is clean; But if there was half of each, it is unclean.

If one found bread there we must consider who form the majority of the bakers. If it was bread of clean flour, we must consider who form the majority of those who eat bread of pure flour. Rabbi Judah says: if it was coarse bread, we must consider who form the majority of those who eat coarse bread.","2802":"If one found meat there, we follow the majority of the butchers. If it was cooked meat, we follow the majority of those who eat cooked meat.","2803":"If one found produce on the road: If the majority of the inhabitants gathered produce into their homes, he is exempt from tithes; If the majority gathered it for selling in the market, he is liable for tithes; If they were half and half, the produce is demai. A granary into which both Israelites and non-Jews put their produce, If the majority were non-Jews, the produce must be considered certainly untithed; If the majority were Israelites, it must be considered demai; If they were half and half, it must be considered certainly untithed, the words of Rabbi Meir.

Concerning what liquids were they speaking? Water, wine and vinegar; but all the other liquids  do not cause susceptibility to uncleanness. Rabbi Nehemiah says pulse is insusceptible, because pulse does not absorb liquids.","2807":"One who drew hot bread off the side of an oven and put it upon the mouth of a jar of wine: Rabbi Meir declares it susceptible to uncleanness; But Rabbi Judah declares it insusceptible.

Crushed wheat, groats, and pearl-barley are unclean everywhere.","2836":"All eggs are presumed to be clean except those of sellers of liquids. But if they sold with them dry produce, they are clean. All fish are presumed unclean. Rabbi Judah says: pieces of aylatit and Egyptian fish which arrives in a basket, and Spanish tunny, these may be presumed clean. All kinds of brine may be presumed unclean. Concerning all these an am ha-aretz may be trusted when he declares them to be clean, except in the case of small fish, since they are usually stored with any am ha-aretz.

Derivatives of blood are: blood from the slaughtering of cattle and wild animals and birds that are clean, and blood from bloodletting for drinking. Whey is like milk, And the sap of olives is deemed like oil, since it is never free from oil, the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Meir says: even though it contains no oil. The blood of a sheretz is like its flesh, it causes uncleanness but does not cause susceptibility to uncleanness, and there is nothing else like it.","2839":"The following cause uncleanness and also susceptibility to uncleanness; The flow of a zav, his spittle, his semen and his urine; A quarter-log of blood from a corpse, and the blood of a menstruant. Rabbi Eliezer says: semen does not cause susceptibility. R. Elazar ben Azariah says: the blood of a menstruant does not cause susceptibility. Rabbi Shimon says: the blood of a corpse does not cause susceptibility, and if it fell on a gourd, he can scrape it off, and it remains clean.","2840":"The following cause neither uncleanness nor susceptibility to uncleanness: Sweat, rotten secretion, excrement, blood issuing with any of these, liquid issuing from a child born in the eight month. Rabbi Yose says: except its blood. The discharge from the bowels of one who drinks the water of Tiberias even though it comes out clean. Blood from the slaughtering of cattle and wild animals and birds that are unclean, and blood from bloodletting for healing. Rabbi Eliezer declares these unclean. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: the milk of a male is clean.","2841":"A woman's milk renders unclean whether its flow is desired or is not desired, but the milk of cattle renders unclean only if its flow is desired. Rabbi Akiva said: there is a kal vehomer argument here: if a woman's milk, which is specifically for infants, can render unclean whether its flow is desired or is not desired, all the more should the milk of cattle, which is for infants and adults, should render unclean both when its flow is desired and when it is not desired. They said to him: No; a woman's milk renders unclean when its flow is not desired, because the blood issuing from her wound is unclean; but how could the milk of cattle render unclean when its flow is not desired, seeing that the blood issuing from its wound is clean? He said to them: I am stricter in the case of milk than in the case of blood, for if one milks for healing, the milk is unclean, whereas if one lets blood for healing, the blood is clean. They said to him: let baskets of olives and grapes prove it; for liquids flowing from them are unclean only when the flow is desired, but when the flow is not desired they are clean. He said to them: No; if you say thus of baskets of olives and grapes which are at first a solid food and at the end become a liquid, could you say the same of milk which remains a liquid from beginning to end? Thus far was the argument. Rabbi Shimon said: from here on in we used to argue before him: let rain water prove it, for it remains a liquid from beginning to end, and renders unclean only when its flow is desired. But he said to us: No; if you say thus of rain water, it is because most of it is intended not for human usage but for the soil and for trees, whereas most milk is intended for human usage.","2842":"There are six degrees of mikvaot, each superior to the other.

Rabbi Shimon says: it becomes unclean whether he washed in it or whether he did not wash in it.","2845":"If a corpse fell into it or an unclean person walked in it, and a clean person drank of it, he is clean. The same rule applies to the water of pools, the water of cisterns, the water of ditches,  the water of caverns, the water of rain flows which have stopped, and mikvehs  of less than forty seahs. They are all clean during the time of rain; When the rain has stopped those near to a city or to a road are unclean, and those distant remain clean until the majority of people pass that way.","2846":"When do they become clean?Bet Shammai say: when their contents have been increased by more than the original quantity and they overflow. Bet Hillel say: when their contents have been increased by more than their original quantity even if they do not overflow. Rabbi Shimon says: when they overflow although their contents have not been so   increased. These are valid for preparing dough for hallah and for the washing of the hands.","2847":"Superior to such water is the water of rain flows which have not stopped.

If one drew water from it in an unclean vessel and then a clean person drank out of the pool, he is clean. If one drew water from it in an unclean vessel and a loaf of terumah fell into the pool, even if he washed his hands in it, it is clean. If unclean water fell into it and a clean person drank of it, he is clean. If unclean water fell into it and one drew water from it in a clean vessel, it is clean. If unclean water fell into it and a loaf of terumah fell in, even if he washed his hands in it, it is clean. All such water is valid for terumah and for the washing of the hands.","2848":"Superior to such water is the water of the mikveh containing forty seahs, for in it people may immerse themselves and immerse other things. Superior to such water is the water of a spring whose own water is little but has been increased by a greater quantity of drawn water. It is equivalent to the mikveh in as much as it may render clean by standing water, and to an ordinary spring in as much as one may immerse in it whatever the quantity of its contents.","2849":"Superior to them are \"smitten waters\" which can purify even when flowing on the ground. Superior to them are \"living waters\" for in them there is immersion for zavim and sprinkling for metzoraim, and they are valid for the preparation of the hatat waters.","2850":"An unclean man who went down to immerse himself: If it is doubtful whether he did immerse himself or not; And even if he did immerse himself,  it is doubtful whether the mikveh contained forty seahs or not; And if there were two mikvehs, one containing forty seahs but the other not containing forty seahs, and he immersed himself in one of them but he does not know in which of them he immersed himself, In such a doubt he is unclean.","2851":"If a mikveh was measured and was found lacking in its prescribed quantity, all things which had been purified in it, whether in private domain or in a public domain,  are accounted unclean retroactively. To what does this rule apply?  To a serious uncleanness. But in the case of a lesser uncleanness, for instance if he ate unclean foods or drank unclean liquids, or if his head and the greater part of his body entered into drawn water, or if three logs of drawn water fell on his head and the greater part of his body,   and he then went down to immerse himself and he is in doubt whether he immersed himself or not, or even if he did immerse himself there is still a doubt whether the mikveh contained forty seahs or not, or if there were two mikvehs, one containing forty seahs and not the other, and he immersed himself in one of them but does not know in which of them he immersed himself, in such a doubt he is accounted clean. Rabbi Yose considers him unclean, for Rabbi Yose says: anything which is presumed to be unclean always remains in a condition of unfitness until it is known that it has become clean; but if there is a doubt whether a person became unclean or caused uncleanness, it is to be accounted clean.","2852":"The case of a doubt about drawn water which the sages have declared clean;If there is a doubt whether three logs of drawn water fell into the mikveh or not, Or even if they did fall in, there is a doubt whether the mikveh contained forty seahs or not, Or if there were two mikvehs one of which contained forty seahs and the other did not, and drawn water fell into one of them and it is not known into which of them it fell, In such a doubt it is accounted clean, because there exists a possibility on which we may depend in declaring it clean. If they both contained less than forty seahs, and drawn water fell into one of them and it is not known into which of them it fell, in such a doubt it is accounted unclean, because there exists no possibility on which we may depend in declaring it clean.","2853":"Rabbi Eliezer says: a quarter-log of drawn water in the beginning makes the mikveh invalid, and three logs on the surface of the water. But the sages say: both in the beginning and at the end, the measure which makes the mikveh invalid is three logs.","2854":"If there were three cavities in a mikveh each holding a log of drawn water, if it is known that forty seahs of valid water fell in before reaching the third cavity, such a mikveh is valid; otherwise it is invalid. Rabbi Shimon declares it valid, since it resembles a mikveh adjoining another mikveh.","2855":"If one scraped mud to the sides and then three logs of water were drawn out from it from the mud, the mikveh is still valid. But if removed the mud away and three logs were drawn from it into the mikveh it becomes invalid. Rabbi Shimon pronounces it valid, since there was no intention to draw the water.","2856":"If one had left wine-jars on the roof to dry and they became filled with water: Rabbi Eliezer says: if it was the season of rain and there was in the cistern a little water, one may break the jars; otherwise one may not break them. Rabbi Joshua says: in either case one may break them or tilt them over, but one may not empty them into the cistern.","2857":"A plasterer forgot his lime-tub in a cistern and it became filled with water: if water flowed above it a little, it may be broken; and if not, it may not be broken, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But Rabbi Joshua says: in either case it may be broken.","2858":"If one had arranged wine-jars in a cistern and they became filled with water, even though the water of the cistern was all soaked up, they may be broken.","2859":"A mikveh which contains forty seahs of water and mud combined: Rabbi Eliezer says: one may immerse objects in the water but one may not immerse them in the mud. But Rabbi Joshua says: in the water and also in the mud. In what kind of mud may objects be immersed? Mud over which water floats. If the water was on one side only, Rabbi Joshua agrees that objects may be immersed in the water but may not be immersed in the mud. Of what kind of mud have they spoken? Mud into which a reed will sink of itself, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: mud in which a measuring-rod will not stand upright. Abba Elazar ben Dulai says: mud into which a plummet will sink. Rabbi Eliezer says: such as will go down into the mouth of a jar. Rabbi Shimon says: such as will enter into the tube of a water- skin. Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says: such as can be measured in a log measure.","2860":"Rabbi Yose says: two mikvehs neither of which contains forty seahs and a log and a half of drawn water fell into this one and a log and a half into this one, and then they are mixed together, they remain valid, since they had never  been called as invalid. But if there is a mikveh holding less than forty seahs, and three logs of drawn water fell into it, and it was then divided into two,  it is invalid, since it had already been called invalid. Rabbi Joshua declares it valid, for Rabbi Joshua used to say: any mikveh containing less than forty seahs into which three logs of drawn water fell and from which a kortov was withdrawn becomes valid, since the three logs have also been diminished. But the sages say: it always remains invalid until the amount of its former contents and a little more are removed.","2861":"How so? If there was a cistern in a courtyard and three logs of drawn water fell into it, it will always remain invalid until the whole of it is removed and a little more, or until another mikveh containing forty se'ahs is placed in the courtyard, so that the higher mikveh is rendered valid by the lower. Rabbi Elazer ben Azariah declares it invalid unless the new mikveh is stopped up.","2862":"If a cistern is full of drawn water and a channel leads into it and out of it, it continues to be invalid until it can be reckoned that there does not remain in it three logs of the former water. If two men each poured a log and a half of drawn water into a mikveh, or if one wrung out his clothes and so poured in water from several places, or if one emptied out a water-jug and so poured in waterfrom several places, Rabbi Akiva declares it valid, But the sages declare it invalid. Rabbi Akiva said: they did not say \"if they poured in,\" rather \"if one poured in.\" But they said: they said neither thus nor thus, but rather \"if there fell in three logs of drawn water.\"","2863":"If the three logs of drawn water fell in from one vessel or from two or from three, they combine together; but if from four, they do not combine together. If a man who had a seminal issue was sick and nine kavs of water fell on him, or if there fell on the head and the greater part of the body of a clean person three logs of drawn water from one vessel or from two or from three, they combine together; but if from four, they do not combine together. In what case does this apply?   When the second began before the first finished. And in what case does the other statement apply? When there was no intention to increase it. But if there was an intention to increase it, if only a kortov in a whole year, they combine together to add up to the three logs.","2864":"If one put vessels under a water-spout, whether they be large vessels or small vessels or even vessels of dung, vessels of stone or earthen vessels,  they make the mikveh invalid. It is all alike whether they were put there purposely or were merely forgotten, the words of Bet Shammai. But Bet Hillel declare it clean in the case of one who forgets. Rabbi Meir said: they voted and Bet Shammai had a majority over Bet Hillel. Yet they agree in the case of one who forgets and leaves vessels in a courtyard that the mikveh remains clean. Rabbi Yose said: the controversy still remains as it was.","2865":"One who put a board under a water-spout: if it had a rim to it, it disqualifies the mikveh; otherwise it does not disqualify the mikveh. If he made it stand upright to be rinsed, in neither case does it disqualify the mikveh.","2866":"If one makes a hollow in a water-spout to collect pebbles, its water disqualifies the mikveh; In the case of a wooden spout if it holds even a little, But in the case of an earthenware spout if it will hold a quarter-log. Rabbi Yose says: also in the case of an earthenware spout if it holds even a little: they have spoken of \"a quarter-log\" only in the case of broken sherds of an earthenware utensil. If the pieces of gravel moved about inside the hollow, it disqualifies the mikveh. If dirt went down into it and was pressed down, the mikveh continues to be valid. If the spout was narrow at each end and wide in the middle, it does not disqualify the mikveh invalid, because it had not been made to gather anything in it.","2867":"Drawn water and rain water which were mixed together in a courtyard or in a cavity or on the steps of a cave: If the greater part was valid, the whole is valid; And if the greater part is invalid, the whole is invalid. If they were equal in quantity, the whole is invalid. When does this apply?   When they were mingled together before they arrived at the mikveh. If the drawn water flowed into the rain water: it was known that there fell in forty seahs of valid water before there came in three logs of drawn water, the mikveh is valid; otherwise it is invalid.","2868":"In the case of a trough in a rock: One may not fill up the hatat waters from it, nor may the hatat waters be consecrated in it, nor may one sprinkle from it. And it does not require a tightly stopped-up covering, And it does not invalidate the mikveh. If it was a vessel and had been joined to the ground with lime: One may fill up the hatat waters from it and the hatat waters may be consecrated in it, and one may sprinkle from it, And it requires a tightly stopped-up covering; And it invalidates the mikveh invalid. If a hole was made in it below or at the side so that it could not contain water in however small a quantity, it is valid. And how large must the hole be? Like the tube of a water-skin. Rabbi Yehudah ben Batera said: it happened in the case of the trough of Yehu in Jerusalem that there was a hole in it like the tube of a water-skin, all the pure things in Jerusalem were made using it. But Bet Shammai sent and broke it down, for Bet Shammai say: it remains a vessel unless the greater part of it is broken down.","2869":"Water from a spring which is made to pass over into a trough becomes invalid. If it was made to pass over the edge in any quantity, what is outside the trough is valid, for the water of a spring purifies however little its quantity. If it is made to pass over into a pool and then is stopped, the pool counts as a mikveh. If it is made to flow again, it is invalid for zavim and for those with skin disease and for the preparation of the hatat waters until it is known that the former water is gone.","2870":"If it was made to pass over the outside of vessels or over a bench: Rabbi Judah says: behold it remains as it was before. Rabbi Yose says: behold it is like a mikveh, except that one may not immerse anything above the bench.","2871":"If water from a spring that flows into many channels was increased in quantity so that it was made to flow in abundance, it remains as it was before. If it was standing and its quantity was increased so that it was made to flow, it becomes equal to a mikveh in that it can purify in standing water, and to a spring in that one may immerse objects therein however small its quantity.","2872":"All seas are equivalent to a mikveh, for it is said, \"And the gathering of the waters He called the seas\" (Genesis 1:10), the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: only the Great Sea is equivalent to a mikveh, for it says \"seas\" only because there are in it many kinds of seas. Rabbi Yose says: all seas afford cleanness when running, and yet they are unfit for zavim and metzoraim and for the preparation of the hatat waters.","2873":"Flowing water is considered like a spring and dripping water is considered like a mikveh. Rabbi Zadok   testified that if flowing water exceeded dripping water with which it was mixed it was valid as flowing water. If dripping water became flowing water, its flow may be blocked by a stick or by a reed or even by a zav or a zavah, and then one may go down and immerse oneself in it, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Yose says: one may not stop the flow of water with anything which is liable to uncleanness.","2874":"If a wave was separated from the sea and was forty seahs, and it fell on a man or on vessels, they become clean. Any place containing forty seahs is valid for immersing oneself and for immersing other things. One may immerse in trenches or in ditches or even in a donkey-track whose water is connected in a valley. Bet Shammai say: one may immerse in a rain torrent. But Bet Hillel say: one may not immerse. They agree that one may block its flow with vessels and immerse oneself in it, but the vessels with which the flow is blocked are not thereby validly immersed.","2875":"Anything which is joined with the water of a mikveh is like a mikveh. One may immerse in holes of a cavern  and in crevices of a cavern  just as they are. The pit of a cavern, one may not immerse in it unless it had a hole as big as the tube of a water-skin. Rabbi Judah said: when is this the case? When it stands by itself;  but if it does not stand by itself, one may immerse in it just as it is.","2876":"If a bucket was full of utensils and they were  immersed, they become clean; But if the bucket was not immersed, the water in the bucket is not considered as joined  with the water of the mikveh unless it be joined by means of a hole in the bucket which is as big as the tube of a water-skin.","2877":"Three mikvehs, two of which held twenty seahs of valid water and the third held twenty seahs of drawn water, and that holding drawn water was at the side: If three persons went down and immersed themselves in them and the water of the three mikvehs joined, the mikvehs are clean and they that immersed themselves become clean. If the one holding the drawn water was in the middle and three persons went down and immersed themselves in them and the water of the three mikvehs joined, the mikvehs continue as they were before and they that immersed themselves are as they were before.","2878":"If a sponge or a bucket containing three logs of water fell into a mikveh, they do not make it invalid, because they have only said: \"if three logs fell in.\"","2879":"A chest or a box which is in the sea: one may not immerse in them unless they have a hole as large as the tube of a water-skin. Rabbi Judah says: in the case of a large vessel the hole should be four handbreadths, and in a small one the hole should be as large as the greater part of it. If there was a sack or a basket in the sea, one may immerse in them as they are, since the water is mixed together. If they are placed under a water-spout, they do not make the mikveh invalid. And they may be immersed and brought up in the ordinary way.","2880":"If there was a broken earthenware vessel in the mikveh and utensils were immersed in it, they become clean from their former uncleanness but are again rendered unclean because of the earthenware vessel. But if water flowed above it in any quantity, they are clean. If water of a spring flowed forth from an oven and a man went down and immersed himself in it, he is clean but his hands become unclean. But if the water was as high above the oven as the height of his hands, his hands also are clean.","2881":"Mikvaot can be joined together if their connection is as big as the tube of a water-skin in thickness and in space, in which two fingers can be fully turned round. If there is a doubt whether it is as big as the tube of a water skin or not, it is invalid, because this is a mitzvah from the Torah. The same applies also to the olive's bulk of a corpse and the olive's bulk of carrion and the lentil's bulk of a sheretz. Anything which remains in the space measuring the tube of a water-skin lessens its measure. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: if it is any water creature whatsoever, the mikvaot remain clean.","2882":"Mikvaot may be made clean by joining drawn water from a higher mikveh to valid water from a lower mikveh or drawn water from a distant mikveh to valid water in a mikveh near at hand. How so? One brings a pipe of earthenware or of lead and puts his hand beneath it till it is filled with water; then he draws it along till the two waters touch   even if it be by a hair's breadth it is sufficient. If in the higher mikveh there were forty seahs and nothing in the lower, one may draw water and carry it on the shoulder and place it in the higher mikveh till forty seahs have flowed down into the lower mikveh.","2883":"If a wall between two mikvaot had a perpendicular crack, their waters may be reckoned together; If it was cracked horizontally, they cannot be reckoned together, unless there is at one place a hole as big as the tube of a water-skin. Rabbi Judah says: the rule is reversed. If there is a breach from one mikveh to the other, they can be reckoned together if the height is as the thickness of the skin of garlic and the breadth like the tube of a water-skin.","2884":"The outlet of a bath-basin: if it is in the center, it renders the bath invalid as a mikveh; but if it is at the side, it does not render it invalid, because then it is like one mikveh adjoining another mikveh, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: if the bath- basin can contain a quarter-log of water before it reaches the outlet, it is valid; but if not, it is not valid. Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says: if the outlet can contain any amount of water, it is invalid.","2885":"The \u2018purifier' in the bathhouse: the bottom was full of drawn water and the top full of valid water, if the space in front of the hole can contain three logs it is invalid as a mikveh. How large must the hole be to contain three logs? 1\/320th   of the pool, the words of Rabbi Yose. But Rabbi Elazar says: even if the bottom pipe was full of valid water and the top pipe full of drawn water and by the hole's side were three logs, the bath is valid, for they have only said: \"if three logs fell in.\"","2886":"Some materials raise the mikveh up to the required quantity and do not make it invalid. Some make it invalid and do not raise it up to the required quantity; And some neither raise it up to the required quantity nor make it invalid. These raise it up to the required quantity and do not make the mikveh invalid. Snow, hail, frosted dew, ice, salt, and thin mud. Rabbi Akiva said: Rabbi Ishmael once argued against me saying; snow does not raise up the mikveh to its required quantity. But the men of Madeba  testified in his name that he had once told them: go and bring snow and with it prepare a mikveh from the outset. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: hailstones are like drawn water. How do they raise it up to the required quantity and not render it invalid? If the mikveh contained forty seahs less one, and a se'ah of them  fell in and made up the required quantity, they thus make up the required quantity but do not render it invalid.","2887":"These invalidate the mikveh and do not raise it up to the required quantity: Drawn water, whether clean or unclean, water that has been used for pickling or for boiling, and grape-skin wine before it becomes vinegar. How do they make the mikveh invalid and do not raise it up the required quantity? If a mikveh contained forty seahs less a kortov, and a kortov of these fell into it, it does not raise it up the required quantity; And if there were three logs of any of these, they would invalidate the mikveh. But other liquids, and the juice of fruits, brine, and liquid in which fish has been pickled, and grape-skin wine that has fermented sometimes raise it up to the required quantity and sometimes do not raise it up. How so? If a mikveh contained forty seahs less one, and a seah of any of these fell in it, it does not raise it up to the required quantity. But if the mikveh contained forty seahs and a se'ah of any of these was put in and one seah was removed, the mikveh is still valid.","2888":"If he rinsed in the mikveh baskets of olives or baskets of grapes and they changed its color, it remains valid. Rabbi Yose says: dye-water renders it invalid by a quantity of three logs, but not merely by changing its color. If wine or the sap of olives fell into it and changed its color, it becomes invalid. What should one do to make it valid again?   One should wait until the rain falls and the color reverts to the color of water. If it contained forty seahs, water may be drawn and carried on the shoulder and put into it until the color reverts to that of water.","2889":"If wine or the sap of olives fell into the mikveh and changed the color of a portion of the water, if there is not a portion of the mikveh that has forty seahs with the color of water, one may not immerse in there.","2890":"If a kortov of wine fell into three logs of water and its color became like that of wine, and the water then fell into a mikveh, it does not render it invalid. If there were three logs of water less a kortov into which a kortov of milk fell, and their color remained like the color of water, and then they fell into a mikveh, they do not render it invalid. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: everything goes by the color.","2891":"If a mikveh contained forty seahs exactly and two persons went down and immersed themselves one after the other, the first becomes clean but the second remains unclean. Rabbi Judah says: if the feet of the first were still touching the water, the second also becomes clean. If one immersed a thick cloak and when he drew it out a part was still in contact with the water and then another person immersed himself in the mikveh, he becomes clean. A pillow case or a cushion of leather, as soon as it is taken out of the water by its open ends the water which still remains in it is drawn water. How should one do it? One should immerse them and draw them up by their lower edges.","2892":"If he immersed a bed in it, even though its legs sink into the thick mud, it still becomes clean because the water touched them before the mud. The water of a mikveh which is shallow, one may press down even bundles of sticks, even bundles of reeds, so that the level of the water may rise, and then go down and immerse oneself. If an unclean needle is placed on the step leading down to a mikveh in a cavern, and the water is put in motion, once a wave has passed over it, the needle becomes clean.","2893":"The land of Israel is clean and its mikvaot are clean. The mikvaot of the nations outside the land are valid for those who had a seminal emission even though they have been filled by a pump-beam; Those in the land of Israel: when outside the entrance to the city are valid even for menstruants, and those within the entrance to the city are valid for those who had a seminal emission but invalid for all others who are unclean. Rabbi Eliezer says: those which are near to a city or to a road are unclean because of laundering; but those at a distance are clean.","2894":"These are the men who had a seminal emission who require immersion: If he noticed that his urine issued in drops or was murky: At the beginning  he is clean; In the middle and at the end, he is unclean; From the beginning to the end, he is clean. If it was white and viscous, he is unclean. Rabbi Yose says: what is white counts like what is murky.","2895":"If he emitted thick drops from his member, he is unclean, the words of Rabbi Elazar Hisma. If one had sexual dreams in the night and arose and found his flesh heated, he is unclean. If a woman discharged semen on the third day, she is clean, the words of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah. Rabbi Ishmael says: sometimes there are four time periods, and sometimes five, and sometimes six. Rabbi Akiva says: there are always five.","2896":"If a non-Jewish woman discharged semen from an Israelite, it is unclean. If an Israelite woman discharged semen from a non-Jewish man, it is clean. If a woman had intercourse and then went down and immersed herself but did not   sweep out the house, it is as though she had not immersed herself. If a man who had a seminal emission immersed himself but did not first pass urine, he again becomes unclean when he passes urine. Rabbi Yose says: if he was sick or old he is unclean, but if he was young and healthy he remains clean.","2897":"If a menstruant placed coins in her mouth and went down and immersed herself, she becomes clean from her former uncleanness, but she becomes unclean on account of her spittle. If she put her hair in her mouth or closed her hand or pressed her lips tightly, it is as though she had not immersed herself. If a person held on to another man or to vessels and immersed them, they remain unclean; but if he had washed his hand before in the water, they become clean. Rabbi Shimon says: he should hold them loosely that water may enter into them. The hidden or wrinkled parts of the body do not need that water should enter into them.","2898":"The following block immersion in the case of a person: threads of wool, threads of flax and the ribbons on the heads of girls. Rabbi Judah says: those of wool or of hair do not interpose, because water enters through them.","2899":"The matted hair on the heart and on the beard and on a woman's hidden parts; pus outside the eye, hardened pus outside a wound and the plaster over it, dried-up juice, clots of excrement on the body, dough under the finger nails, sweat-crumbs, miry clay, potter's clay, and road-clay. What is meant by 'miry clay\u2019? This means the clay in pits, for it is written: \"He lifted me out of the miry pit, the slimy clay\" (Psalms 40:3). \"Potter's clay\" according to its literal sense. Rabbi Yose declares potter's clay clean, but clay for putty unclean. And \"road-clay.\" These become like road-side pegs in these kinds of clay one may not immerse oneself nor immerse other things with them; But in all other clay one may immerse when it is wet. One may not immerse oneself with dust still on one's feet. One may not immerse a kettle with soot on it unless he scraped it.","2900":"The following do not block: the matted hair of the head and of the armpits and of a man's hidden parts. Rabbi Eliezer says: it is the same with a man or a woman: if it is something which one finds annoying, it blocks; but if it is something which one does not find annoying, it does not interpose.","2901":"Pus within the eye, hardened pus within a wound, juice that is moist, moist excrement on the body, excrement inside the finger nail, and a dangling finger nail and the downy hair of a child. These are not liable to uncleanness   and do not cause uncleanness. The membrane which forms over a wound is liable to uncleanness and causes uncleanness.","2902":"In the case of vessels the following block: pitch and myrrh; In the case of glass vessels, whether inside or outside; On a table or on a board or on a couch; On those that are usually kept clean they block; On those that are allowed to remain dirty they do not block. They block in the case of beds belonging to householders, but they do not block on beds belonging to a poor person. They block on the saddle of a house-holder, but they do not block on the saddle of a dealer in water-skins. They block in the case of a pack-saddle. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: only if the stain is as big as an Italian issar.","2903":"On clothing: if on one side only they do not block. But if found on two sides they do block. Rabbi Judah says in the name of Rabbi Ishmael: on one side also. Rabbi Yose says: in the case of builders they block if on one side, but in the case of the ditch-digger only if on both sides.","2904":"They do not block in the case of aprons belonging to workers in pitch, potters, or trimmers of trees. Rabbi Judah says: the same applies also to summer fruit-driers. This is the general rule: if it is something which one cares enough to remove, it blocks; but if it is something which one does not care enough to remove, it does not block.","2905":"Any handles of vessels which have been fixed not in their usual manner, or, if fixed in their usual manner, have not been fixed firmly, or, if fixed firmly, have been broken, they block. If a vessel was immersed with its mouth downwards, it is as though it had not been immersed. If immersed in the regular manner but without the attachment, it becomes clean only if turned on its side. If a vessel is narrow at each end and broad in the center, it becomes clean only if turned on its side. A flask which has its mouth turned inwards becomes clean only if a hole is made at the side. An inkpot of laymen becomes clean only if a hole is made at the side. The inkpot of Joseph the priest had a hole at its side.","2906":"A bolster and a cushion of leather it is necessary that the water enter inside them. A round cushion or a ball or a bootmaker's last or an amulet or a phylactery, it is not necessary that the water enter inside them. This is the general rule: any article the filling of which is not usually taken out and put in may be immersed unopened.","2907":"The following do not require that the water shall enter inside them:Knots in the clothes of a poor man, or in tassels, or in the thong of a sandal, or in a head-tefillin if it is fastened tightly, or in an arm-tefillin if it does not move up or down, or in the handles of a water-skin, or in the handles of a wallet.","2908":"The following require that water shall enter inside them:The knot in an undergarment which is tied to the shoulder. The hem of a sheet must be stretched out. And the knot of head tefillin if it is not fastened tightly, Or of the arm-tefillin if it moves up and down. And the laces of a sandal. Clothes which are immersed when they have just been washed must be kept immersed until they bubble up; But if they are immersed when already dry, they must be kept immersed until they throw up bubbles and then cease to bubble up.","2909":"Any handles of vessels which are too long and which will be cut short, need only be immersed up to the point of their proper measure. Rabbi Judah says: they are unclean until the whole of them is immersed. The chain of a large bucket, to the length of four handbreadths, and a small bucket, to the length of ten handbreadths, and they need only be immersed up to the point of their proper measure. Rabbi Tarfon says: it is not clean unless the whole of the chain-ring is immersed. The rope bound to a basket is not counted as a connection unless it has been sewn on.","2910":"Bet Shammai say: hot water may not be immersed in cold, or cold in hot, foul in fresh or fresh in foul. But Bet Hillel say: it may be immersed. A vessel full of liquids which one immersed, it is as if it has not been immersed. If it was full of urine, this is reckoned as water. If it contained hatat waters, it is unclean unless the water of the mikveh which enters the vessel exceeds the hatat waters. Rabbi Yose says: even if a vessel with the capacity of a kor  contains but a quarter-log, it is as if it had not been immersed.","2911":"All foods combine together to make up the half of a half-loaf which makes the body unfit. All liquids combine together  to make up the quarter-log which makes the body unfit. This is more of a stringency in the case of one who drinks unclean liquids than in the case of the mikveh, for in this case they have made all other liquids like water.","2912":"If one ate unclean foods or drank unclean liquids and then he immersed and then vomited them up, they are still unclean because they did not become clean in the body. If one drank unclean water and immersed and then vomited it up, it is clean because it became clean in the body. If one swallowed a clean ring and then went into the tent of a corpse, if he sprinkled himself once and twice and immersed himself and then vomited it up, behold, it remains as it was before. If one swallowed an unclean ring, he may immerse himself and eat terumah. If he vomited it up, it is unclean and it renders him unclean. If an arrow was stuck into a man, it blocks so long as it is visible. But if it is not visible, he may immerse himself and eat terumah.","2913":"The signs of negaim are two which, in fact, are four. The bright spot is bright white like snow; secondary to it is the sign as white as the lime of the Temple. The rising is as white of the skin of an egg; secondary to it is the like white wool, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: the rising is white wool and secondary to it is like the white of the skin of an egg.","2914":"The variegation of the snow-like whiteness is like wine mixed with snow. The variegation of the lime-like whiteness is like blood mixed with milk, the words of Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: the reddishness in either of them is like wine mixed with water, only that in the snow-like whiteness the color is bright while in that of lime-like whiteness it is duller.","2915":"These four colors combine with each other to declare free from uncleanness, to certify or to shut up. \"To shut up\" one who is at the end of the first week; \"To declare free from uncleanness\", one who is at the end of the second week. \"To certify\", one in which a discoloration or white hair arose, by the end of the first week, by the end of the second week or after it had been declared free from uncleanness. \"To certify\", when a spreading arose in it by the end of the first week, by the end of the second week or after it had been declared free from uncleanness. \"To certify\", when all one's skin turned white after it had been declared free from uncleanness; \"To declare free from uncleanness\u2019, when all one's skin turned white after the sign had been certified unclean or after it had been shut up. These are the colors of signs of negaim upon which depend all decisions concerning negaim.","2916":"Rabbi Hanina, the vice-chief of priests, says: the colors of negaim are sixteen. Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas says: the colors of negaim are thirty-six. Akaviah ben Mahalalel says: seventy-two. Rabbi Hanina the vice-chief of priests says: negaim may not be inspected for the first time at the end of Shabbat, since the end of that week will fall on Shabbat; Nor on a Monday, since the end of the second week will fall on Shabbat; Nor on a Tuesday, in the case of houses, since the end of the third week will fall on Shabbat. Rabbi Akiva says: they may be inspected at all times, and if the time for the second inspection falls on Shabbat it is postponed to after Shabbat; and this procedure leads sometimes to a leniency and sometimes to a stringency.","2917":"How does it lead to a leniency?If the nega had two white hairs and one white hair disappeared. If there were two white hairs and they turned black. If one hair was white and the other black and both turned black. If they were long and then they became short. If one was long and the other short and both became short. If a boil adjoined both hairs or one of them. If the boil surrounded both hairs or one of them. Or if they were separated from each other by a boil, the quick flesh of a boil, a burning, or the quick flesh of a burning, or a white scurf. If it had undiscolored flesh and this undiscolored flesh disappeared. If it was square and then became round or elongated. If it was encompassed and then moved to the side. If it was united and then it was dispersed. Or a boil appeared and made its way into it. If it was encompassed, parted or lessened by a boil, the quick flesh of a boil, a burning, the quick flesh of a burning, or a white scurf; If it had a spreading and then the spreading disappeared; Or the first sign itself disappeared or was so lessened that both are less than the size of a split bean; Or if a boil, the quick flesh of a boil, a burning, the quick flesh of a burning, or a  white scurf, formed a division between the first sign and the spreading Behold these lead to a leniency in the law.","2918":"How does it lead to a stringency?If it had no white hairs and then white hairs appeared; If they were black and then turned white; If one hair was black and the other white and both turned white; If they were short and they became long; If one was short and the other long and both became long. If a boil adjoined both hairs or one of them, if a boil encompassed both hairs or one of them or if they were parted from one another by a boil, the quick flesh of a boil, a burn, or the quick flesh of a burn, or white scurf, and then one of these things disappeared. If it had no quick flesh and then quick flesh appeared. If it was round or long and then became four sided; If it was at the side and then it became encompassed. If it was dispersed and then it became united or a  boil appeared and made its way into it. If it was encompassed, parted or lessened by a boil, the quick flesh of a boil, a burn, the quick flesh of a burn or white scurf, and then they disappeared; If it had no spreading and then a spreading appeared; If a boil, the quick flesh of a boil, a burn, the quick flesh of a burn, or white scurf formed a division between the first sign and the spreading and then they disappeared. Behold all of these lead to a stringency.","2919":"The bright spot in a German appears as dull white, and the dull white spot in an Ethiopian appears as bright white. Rabbi Ishmael says: the children of Israel are like boxwood, neither black nor white but of an intermediate shade. Rabbi Akiva says: painters have materials with which they portray figures in black, in white, and in an intermediate shade; let, therefore a paint of an intermediate shade be brought and applied around the outside of the nega, and it will then appear as on skin of intermediate shade. Rabbi Judah says: in determining the colors of negaim the law is to be lenient and not stringent; let,therefore, the negaim of the German be inspected on the color  of his own body  so that the law is lenient, and let that of the Ethiopian be inspected as if it were on the intermediate shade so that the law is also lenient. The sages say: both are to be treated as if the nega was on the intermediate shade.","2920":"Negaim may not be inspected in the early morning or in the evening, nor in a house, nor on a cloudy day, because then the dull white appears like bright white; nor may they be inspected at noon, because then the bright white appears like dull white. When are they to be inspected? During the third, fourth, fifth, eighth or ninth hour, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah ruled: during the fourth, fifth, eighth or ninth hour.","2921":"A priest who is blind in one eye or the light of whose eyes is dim should not inspect negaim; for it says, \"Wherever the priest's eyes can see\" (Leviticus 13:12). In a dark house one may not open up windows in order to inspect his nega.","2922":"What is the posture of examining negaim?A man is inspected in the posture of one that hoes or one that gathers olives. And a woman is inspected in the posture of one who is arranging dough and one who nurses her child, and one that weaves at an upright loom if the nega was in the right armpit. Rabbi Judah says: also in the posture of one that spins flax if it was within the left armpit. Just as is the posture for examining for the nega, so too is the posture for shaving hair.","2923":"All negaim may be examined by a person, except his own. Rabbi Meir ruled: not even the negaim of his relatives. All vows may be released by a person, except his own. Rabbi Judah says: not even those vows of his wife that affect relationships between her and others. All firstlings may be examined by a person, except his own firstlings.","2924":"Everyone can become impure from negaim, except for a non-Jew and a resident alien. All are qualified to inspect negaim, but only a priest may declare them unclean or clean. He is told, \"Say: 'unclean,'\" and he repeats \"unclean,\" or \"Say: 'clean,'\" and he repeats \"clean.\" Two negaim may not be inspected simultaneously whether in one man or in two men; rather he inspects one first and isolates him, certifies him as unclean or pronounces him clean, and then he inspects the second. One who is isolated may not be isolated again nor may one who is certified unclean be certified unclean again. One who is certified unclean may not be isolated nor may one who is isolated be certified unclean. But in the beginning, or at the end of a week, he may isolate on account of the one nega and isolate him on account of another one; he may certify him unclean on account of one sign and also certify him unclean on account of another sign; he may isolated the one sign and declare the other clean, or certify the one unclean and declare the other clean.","2925":"A bridegroom on whom a nega has appeared is given the seven days of the marriage feast in which he is not examined; This grace period is given to him, and to his house and to his clothing. Similarly during a festival, one is granted exemption from inspection during all the days of the festival.","2926":"The skin of the flesh becomes unclean for two weeks and by one of three signs: by white hair or by quick flesh or by a spreading. \"By white hair or by quick flesh\" in the beginning, at the end of the first week, at the end of the second  week, or after it had been pronounced clean. \"Or by a spreading,\" at  the end of the first week, at the end of the second week,   or after it had been pronounced clean.

None of the leprosy signs is for less than a week or for more than three weeks.","2932":"There are laws that apply to the white hair that do not apply to the spreading, while others apply to the spreading and do not apply to the white hair. That white hair causes uncleanness at the beginning, it causes uncleanness whatever the state of its whiteness, and it is never a sign of cleanness. There are laws that apply to the spreading, for the spreading causes uncleanness however small its extent, it causes uncleanness for all negaim and even when it is outside the nega, and these laws do not apply to the white hair.","2933":"There are laws that apply to the quick flesh that do not apply to the spreading, while other restrictions apply to the spreading  and do not apply to the quick flesh. That quick flesh causes uncleanness at the beginning, it causes uncleanness whatever its color, and it is never a sign of cleanness. There are laws that apply to the spreading, for the spreading causes uncleanness however small  its extent, it causes uncleanness in all forms of negaim and also where it is outside the leprosy sign, and these laws do not apply to the quick flesh.","2934":"There are laws that apply to white hair that do not apply to quick flesh, while others apply to quick flesh and not to white hair. White hair causes uncleanness in a boil and in a burn, whether growing together or dispersed, and whether encompassed or unencompassed. There are laws that apply to quick flesh, for quick flesh causes uncleanness in scalp baldness and in forehead baldness, whether it was turned or was not turned, it prevents the cleanness of one who is turned all white, and causes uncleanness whatever its color, and these do not apply to white hair.","2935":"If the two hairs were black at the root and white at the tip he is clean. If they were white at the root and black at the tip he is unclean. How much whiteness must there be? Rabbi Meir says: any amount. Rabbi Shimon says: enough to be cut with a pair of scissors. If it was single at the root but split at the tip, and it looks like two hairs, he is clean. If a bright spot had two white hairs or black hair he is unclean, for we are not concerned that the place of the black hair lessened the space of the bright spot, since the former is of no consequence.","2936":"If a bright spot was of the size of a split bean and a string extended from it, if it was two hairs in breadth, it is subject to the restrictions in respect of white hair and spreading, but not to that in respect of its quick flesh. If there were two bright spots and a streak extended from one to the other, if it was two hairs in breadth, it combines them; but if not, it does not combine them.","2937":"If a bright spot the size of a split bean had within it quick flesh the size of a lentil and there was white hair within the quick flesh: if the quick flesh disappeared the spot is unclean on account of the white hair; if the white hair disappeared it is unclean on account of the quick flesh. Rabbi Shimon makes it clean, since it was not the bright spot that caused it the hair to turn white. If a bright spot together with the quick flesh in it was of the size of a split bean and there was white hair within the spot: if the quick flesh disappeared the bright spot is unclean on account of the white hair; if the white hair disappeared it is unclean on account of the quick flesh. Rabbi Shimon says that it is clean, since it was not a bright spot the size of a split bean that caused the hair to turn white. He agrees that if where the white hair was, was the size of a split bean, that it is impure.","2938":"A bright spot which had quick flesh and a spreading: if the quick flesh disappeared it is unclean on account of the spreading; if the spreading disappeared it is unclean on account of the quick flesh. So also in the case of white hair and a spreading. If it the bright spot disappeared and appeared again at the end of the week, it is regarded as though it had remained as it was. If it reappeared after it had been pronounced clean, it must be inspected as a new one. If it had been bright white but was now dull white, or if it had been dull white but was now bright white, it is regarded as though it had remained as it was, provided that it does not become less white than the four principal colors. If it contracted and then spread, or if it spread and then contracted: Rabbi Akiva rules that it is unclean; But the sages rule that it is clean.","2939":"A bright spot the size of a split bean, and it spreads to the extent of half a split bean, while of the original spot there disappeared as much as half a split bean: Rabbi Akiba says: it must be inspected as a new one, But the sages say: it is clean.","2940":"A bright spot the size of a split bean that spread to the extent of half a split bean and a little more, while as much as half the size of a split bean disappeared from the original spot: Rabbi Akiva says that it is unclean, But the sages say that it is clean.

A bright spot the size of half a split bean with one hair and then there appeared another spot of the size of a half a split bean with one hair, this is to be isolated. A bright spot the size of half a split bean with two hairs and another spot of the size of half a split bean appeared with one hair, this is to be isolated.","2942":"A bright spot the size of a split bean and there was nothing else, and then there appeared a bright spot of the size of half a split bean having two hairs, this one is declared unclean. Because they said: if the bright spot preceded the white hair he is unclean; if the white hair preceded the bright spot he is clean; and if it is doubtful he is unclean. Rabbi Joshua regards this as unsolvable.","2943":"Any doubtful nega is regarded as clean, except this case and one other. Which is that? If he had a bright spot of the size of a split bean and he was isolated, and by the end of the week it was as big as a sela, and it is doubtful whether it is the original one or whether another came in its place, he must be regarded as unclean.","2944":"If one had been certified unclean on account of white hair, and the white hair disappeared and other white hair appeared, And so also in the case of quick flesh or a spreading, Whether this occurred in the beginning, at the end of the first week, at the end of the second week, or after he had been released from uncleanness, he is regarded as being in the same position as before. If he had been certified unclean on account of quick flesh, and the quick  flesh disappeared and other quick flesh appeared, And so also in the case of white hair and spreading, Whether this occurred in the beginning, at the end of the first week, at the end of the second week, or after the man had been released from uncleanness, he is regarded as being in the same position as before. If he had been certified unclean on account of a spreading, and the spreading disappeared and another spreading appeared, And so also in the case of white hair, Whether this occurred at the end of the first week, at the end of the second week, or after the man had been released from uncleanness, he is in the same position as before.","2945":"Deposited hair: Akaviah ben Mahalalel holds it is unclean. But the sages hold it to be clean. What is \"deposited hair\"? If one had a bright spot with white hair in it, and the bright spot disappeared leaving the white hair in position and then it reappeared: Akaviah ben Mahalalel holds it to be unclean, But the sages hold it to be clean. Rabbi Akiva said: in this case I agree that he is clean; But what is \"deposited hair\"?   If one had a bright spot of the size of a split bean with two hairs in it, and a part the size of a half a split bean disappeared leaving the white hair in the place of the white spot and then it reappeared. They said to him: just as they rejected the ruling of Akaviah so is there no validity in your ruling.","2946":"Any doubt in negaim in the beginning is regarded as clean before uncleanness has been established, but after uncleanness has been established a doubt is regarded as unclean. How is this so? If two men came to a priest one having a bright spot the size of a split bean and the other having one of the size of a sela, and at the end of the week each had one the size of a sela, and it is not known on which of them the spreading had occurred, Whether this occurred with one man or with two men, each is clean. Rabbi Akiva said: if one man is involved he is unclean, but if two men are involved each is clean.","2947":"\"But after uncleanness has been established a doubt is regarded as unclean.\" How so? If two men came to a priest, one having a bright spot of the size of a split bean and the other having one of the size of a sela and at the end of the week each was of the size of a sela and a little more, both are unclean; And even though both returned to be the size of a sela both are unclean, and remain unclean until they return to the size of a split split bean. They is what they meant when they said, \"but after uncleanness has been established a doubt is regarded as unclean.\"","2948":"The minimum size of a bright spot must be that of a Cilician split bean squared. The space covered by a split bean equals that of nine lentils. The space covered by a lentil equals that of four hairs; It turns out that the size of a bright spot must be no less than that of thirty-six hairs.","2949":"If a bright spot was of the size of a split bean and in it there was quick flesh of the size of a lentil: If the bright spot grew larger it is unclean, but if it grew smaller it is clean. If the quick flesh grew larger it is unclean, and if it grew smaller it is clean.","2950":"A bright spot the size of a split bean and in it there was quick flesh less than the size of a lentil: If the bright spot grew larger it is unclean, but if it grew smaller it is clean. If the quick flesh grew larger it is unclean, but if it grew smaller, Rabbi Meir rules that it is unclean; But the sages rule that it is clean, since a nega cannot spread within itself.","2951":"If a bright spot was larger in size than a split bean and in it there was quick flesh larger than a lentil, irrespective of whether they increased or decreased, they are unclean, provided that they do not decrease to less than the prescribed minimum.","2952":"If a bright spot was the size of a split bean and quick flesh the size of a lentil encompassed it, and outside the quick flesh there was another bright spot, the inner one must be isolated and the outer one must be certified unclean. Rabbi Yose says: the quick flesh is not a sign of uncleanness for the outer one, since the inner bright spot is within it. If it decreased or disappeared: Rabban Gamaliel says: if its destruction was on its inner side it is a sign of spreading of the inner bright spot while the outer one is clean, but if its destruction was on its outer side, the outer one is clean while the inner one must be isolated. Rabbi Akiva says: in either case it is clean.","2953":"Rabbi Shimon said: when is this the case?  When the quick flesh was exactly the size of a lentil. But if it was larger than a lentil, the excess is a sign of spreading of the inner one, and the outer one is unclean. If there was white scurf less that the size of a lentil, it is a sign of the spreading of the inner bright spot but it is not a sign of spreading of the outer one.","2954":"There are twenty-four tips of limbs in the human body that do not become unclean on account of quick flesh: the tips of the fingers and the toes, the tips of the ears, the tip of the nose, the tip of the penis; and also the nipples of a woman.

All these: Do not become unclean on account of negaim Do not combine with other negaim, A nega is not considered to spread into them, Do not become unclean on account of quick flesh, And they do not act to prevent a person from being considered to have turned completely white. If subsequently a bald spot arose in the head or beard, or if a boil, a burn or a blister formed a scar: They may become unclean by negaim, But they do not combine with other negaim, A nega is not considered to spread into them, And they do not become unclean on account of quick flesh. But they do act to prevent a person from being considered to have all turned white. The head and the beard before they have grown hair, and warts with thin necks on the head or the beard, are treated as the skin of the flesh.","2956":"The following bright spots are clean:Those that one had  before the Torah was given, Those that a non-Jew had when he converted; Or a child when it was born, Or those that were in a crease and were subsequently uncovered. If they were on the head or the beard, on a boil, a burn or a blister that is festering, and subsequently the head or the beard became bald, and the boil, burn or blister turned into a scar, they are clean. If they were on the head or the beard before they grew hair, and they then grew hair  and subsequently became bald, or if they were on the body before the boil, burn or blister before they were festering and then these formed a scar or were healed: Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob said that they are unclean since at the beginning and at the end they were unclean, But the sages say: they are clean.","2957":"If their color changed, whether to be lenient or stringent: How is it \"to be lenient\"? If it was white like snow and it became white like the lime of the Temple, or like wool or like the skin of an egg, or as white as the second shade of a rising or the second shade of bright white. How is it \"to be stringent\"? If it was the color of the skin of an egg and it became like white wool, the lime of the Temple or like snow. Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah rules that they are clean. Rabbi Eliezer Hisma says:  if the change was to be lenient it is clean, but if it was one to be stringent it must be inspected as if it were a new one.

And as regards cleanness: If they were plucked out before he came to the priest, he is clean; But if after he had been certified as unclean, he remains unclean.

When does he attain cleanness after he has been certified unclean? Rabbi Eliezer says: after another nega arises in him and he has attained cleanness  after it. But the sages says: only after another nega has spread over his whole body or after his bright spot has been reduced to less than the size of a split bean.","2960":"If one had a bright spot and it was cut off, he becomes clean; If he cut it off intentionally: Rabbi Eliezer says: he is clean only after another nega arises in him and he has attained cleanness after it. But the sages say: only after it has spread over all his body. If it was on the tip of one's foreskin, he should be circumcised.","2961":"If a nega broke out completely upon one who was unclean, he becomes clean; If the ends of his limbs reappeared, he becomes unclean until the bright spot is reduced to less than the size of a split bean. If it broke out completely upon him when he was clean, he becomes unclean; If the ends of his limbs reappeared, he remains unclean until his bright spot resumes its former size.","2962":"A bright spot the size of a split bean in which there was quick flesh the size of a lentil and then it broke out covering a person's entire skin and then the quick flesh disappeared, or if the quick flesh disappeared and then the bright spot broke out covering all his skin, he is clean.

A bright spot in which there was a spreading and then it broke out covering his entire skin, he is clean. But in all of these cases if even the ends of the his limbs reappeared in their natural color, he is unclean. If it broke out covering a part of his skin he is unclean; If it broke out covering all his skin he is clean.","2964":"In all cases of breaking out and covering the ends of the limbs whereby the unclean have been pronounced clean, if they reappeared they become unclean again.

If subsequently they become uncovered these are unclean, even if this occurs a hundred times.","2965":"Any part of the body that can be subject to the uncleanness of a bright spot nega can prevent the effectiveness of the breaking out over the entire body, and any part that cannot be subject to the uncleanness of a bright spot nega does not prevent the effectiveness of the breaking out abroad. How so? If it broke out covering all of his skin, but not on the head or the beard, or on a festering boil, burn or blister, and then the head or the beard became bald, or the boil, burn or blister turned into a scar, he is clean. If it broke out covering all of his skin, except a spot of the size of half a lentil near the head or beard, or near a boil, burn or blister, and then the head or the beard became bald, or the boil, burn or blister turned into a scar, even though the place of the quick flesh became a bright spot, he is unclean unless it breaks out covering all his body.","2966":"If there were two bright spots, one unclean and the other clean, and they broke out from one to the other, and then a nega broke out covering all of his skin, he is clean. If the bright spots were on his upper lip and lower lip, or on two of his fingers, or on his two eyelids, even though they cleave together and appear as one, he is clean. If it broke out covering all his skin except white scurf, he is unclean. If the ends of his limbs reappeared in the color of white scurf, he is clean. If the ends of his limbs reappeared to the extent of less than a lentil: Rabbi Meir rules that he is unclean, But the sages rule that a piece of white scurf less in size than a lentil, is a sign of uncleanness in the beginning, but it is not a sign of uncleanness at the end.","2967":"One who came in front of the priest with all his body white is isolated. If white hair grew, he is certified unclean. If both hairs or one of them turned black, If both or one of them became short, If a boil adjoined both or one of them, If a boil surrounded both or one of them, Or if a boil, the quick flesh of a boil, a burn, the quick flesh of a burn, or white scurf divided them he is pure. If quick flesh or white hair arose, he is unclean; But if neither quick flesh nor white hair arose he is clean. In all these cases if the ends of his limbs reappeared he remains as he was before. If the nega broke out, covering a part of him, he is unclean. If it broke out covering all of them, he is clean.","2968":"If it broke out covering all of his skin all at once: If this originated in a condition of cleanness, he is unclean; But if it originated in a condition of uncleanness, he is clean. One who becomes clean after having been isolated is exempt from the uncovering his head and rending his clothes, from shaving his hair and from bringing the birds. If he becomes clean after he had been certified unclean, he is liable to all these. Both convey uncleanness by entering.","2969":"If one came with his whole body white, and on it there was quick flesh to the extent of a lentil, and then the nega spread out covering all his skin, and then the ends of his limbs reappeared: Rabbi Ishmael says: this is the same as when the ends of the limbs reappear in that of a large bright spot. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah ruled: as when the ends of the limbs  reappeared in a small bright spot.","2970":"There is one who shows his nega to the priest and thereby gains advantage, while there is one who shows and loses. How so? If one was certified unclean and the signs of his uncleanness disappeared, and before he could show it to the priest the nega broke out covering all his skin, he is clean; whereas if he had shown it to the priest he would have been unclean. If he had a bright spot in which there was nothing else, and before he could show it to the priest it broke out covering all his skin, he is unclean; whereas if he had shown it to the priest he would have been clean.","2971":"A boil or a burn may become unclean in a week and by two signs: by white hair or by a spreading. What is a \"boil\"? An injury received from wood, stone, peat, or the waters of Tiberias, of from any other object whose heat is not due to fire is a  boil. What exactly is a \"burn\"? A burn caused by a live coal, hot embers, or any object whose heat is due to fire is a burning.","2972":"A boil and a burn do not combine, nor do they spread from one to the other, nor do they spread from there to the skin of the flesh, nor does a nega on the skin of the flesh spread to them. If they were festering they are clean. If they formed a scale as thick as garlic peel, such is the scar of the boil that is spoken of in the Torah. If they were subsequently healed, even though there was a mark in their place, they are regarded as the skin of the flesh.","2973":"They asked R. Eliezer: \"What is the ruling concerning one who had a bright spot the size of a sela form on the inside of his hand and it covered up the scar of a boil?\" He replied: \"He should be isolated.\" They said to him: \"Why? Since it is neither capable of growing white hair nor can it effectively spread nor does quick flesh cause it to be unclean?\" He replied, \"It is possible that it will contract and then spread again.\" They said to him, \"But what about when its only the size of a split bean?' He said to them: I have not heard anything. Rabbi Judah ben Batera said to him, \"Can I teach something about this?\" He replied, \"If you would thereby confirm the ruling of the sages, go ahead.\" He said, \"Lest another boil would arise outside it and spread into it. He replied: \"You are a great scholar for you have confirmed the words of the sages.\"","2974":"Scalls may become unclean for two weeks and by two signs: by thin yellow hair and by spreading. By thin yellow hair: means stunted and short, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said: even though it is long. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said: what is the meaning of the expression when people say, \"This stick is thin,\" or \"This reed is thin\"? Does \"thin\" imply that it is stunted and short and not stunted and long? Rabbi Akiva replied: before we learn from the reed let us learn from hair, for they say \"So and so's hair is thin\": \"thin\" means that it is stunted  and short and not stunted and long.","2975":"Yellow thin hair causes uncleanness whether it is clustered together or dispersed, whether it is encompassed or unencompassed, or whether it came after the scall or before it, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Shimon says: it causes uncleanness only when it came after the scall. Rabbi Shimon said: Is it not logical: if white hair, against which other hair affords no protection, causes uncleanness only when it comes after the nega, how much more should yellow thin hair, against which other hair does afford protection, cause uncleanness only when it comes after the scall? Rabbi Judah says: Whenever it was necessary to say, \"it turns\" Scripture says, \"it turns.\" But the scall, since about it Scripture says, \"there is no yellow hair in it,\" it causes uncleanness whether it came before or after it.","2976":"Black hair that sprouts up affords protection against yellow hair and against a spreading, whether it was clustered together or dispersed, whether it was encompassed or unencompassed. And that which is left over from before the scall affords protection against yellow hair and against a spreading, whether it is clustered together or dispersed, and also when encompassed, but it affords no protection where it is at the side unless it is distant from the standing hair by the place of two hairs. If one hair was yellow and the other black, or if one was yellow and the other white, they afford no protection.","2977":"Yellow hair that preceded a scall is clean. Rabbi Judah says that it is unclean. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: it neither causes uncleanness nor does it afford protection. Rabbi Shimon says: anything in a scall that is not a sign of uncleanness is a sign of cleanness.","2978":"How does one shave who has a scall? He shaves outside it and leaves next to it two hairs in order to determine whether it spreads. If he was certified unclean on account of yellow hair, and then the yellow hair disappeared and other yellow hair appeared, and so also if there was a spreading,   irrespective of whether the certification took place at the beginning, at the end of the first week, at the end of the second week or after his release from uncleanness, behold he remains as he was before. If he was certified unclean on account of a spreading, and the spreading disappeared and then reappeared, and so also if there was yellow hair, irrespective of whether the certification took place at the end of the first week, at the end of the second week or after his release from uncleanness, he remains as he was before.","2979":"Two scalls side by side and a line of hair separating between them: If a gap opened up in one place he is unclean, But if it opened up in two places he is clean. How big should the gap be?  The space of two hairs. If there was a gap in one place, even though it is as big as a split bean, he is unclean.","2980":"Two scalls one within the other and a line of hair separating between them: If there appeared a gap in one place the inner one is unclean, But if in two places it is clean. How big must the gap be?  The space of two hairs. If there was a gap in one place of the size of a split bean he is clean.","2981":"One who has a scall with yellow hair within it is unclean. If subsequently black hair grew in it, he is clean; even if the black hair disappeared again he remains clean. Rabbi Shimon ben Judah says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: any scall that has once been pronounced clean can never again be unclean. Rabbi Shimon says: any yellow hair that has once been pronounced clean can never again be unclean.","2982":"If one had a scall the size of a split bean and it spread over all his head he becomes clean. The head and the beard do not prevent one another, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Shimon says: they do prevent. Rabbi Shimon said: Is there not a logical inference: if the skin of the face and the skin of the body, between which something intervenes, do prevent one another, the head and the beard, between which nothing intervenes, should they not also prevent one another? The head and the beard do not combine, nor is a spreading from one to the other effective. What exactly counts as the beard? From the joint of the jaw to the thyroid cartilage.","2983":"Scalp baldness or forehead baldness may become unclean in two weeks and by two signs: by quick flesh or by spreading. What constitutes baldness? If one ate neshem or smeared himself with neshem or had a wound from which hair can no longer grow. What is the extent of scalp baldness? From the crown sloping backwards to the protruding cartilage of the neck. What is the extent of forehead baldness? From the crown sloping forwards to the region facing the hair above. Scalp baldness and forehead baldness cannot be combined, nor is spreading from one to the other effective. Rabbi Judah says: if there is hair between them they cannot be combined, but if there is none they must be combined.","2984":"All garments can contract the uncleanness of negaim except those of non-Jews. One who buys garments with signs of negaim from non-Jews they must be inspected as if the signs had then first appeared. The hides of animals of the sea do not contract the uncleanness of negaim. If one joined to them anything which grows on land, even if it is only a thread or a cord, as long as it is something that is susceptible to uncleanness, they also become susceptible to uncleanness.","2985":"Camel's wool and sheep's wool that have been hackled together: If the majority is camel's hair, they are not susceptible to negaim; But if the majority is sheep's wool they are susceptible to negaim. If it is half and half they are susceptible to negaim. And the same law applies also to linen and hemp that have been hackled together.","2986":"Colored hides and garments are not susceptible to negaim. Houses whether they are colored or not colored, are susceptible to negaim, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: hides are like houses. Rabbi Shimon says: those that are naturally colored are susceptible to uncleanness but those that are artificially dyed are not susceptible to uncleanness.","2987":"A garment whose warp was colored and whose woof was white, or whose woof was colored and whose warp was white, all depends on what is most visible. Garments contract uncleanness if they are an intense green or an intense red. If the nega was green and it spread out red, or if it was red and it spread out green, it is unclean. If its color changed and then it spread, or if it changed and it did not spread, it is regarded as if it had not changed. Rabbi Judah says: let it be inspected as if it then appeared for the first time.","2988":"A nega that remained unchanged during the first week must be washed and isolated. One that remains unchanged during the second week must be burned. One that spread during the first or the second week must be burned. If it becomes dimmer in the beginning: Rabbi Ishmael says: it should be washed and isolated. But the sages say: he is not required to do so. If the nega became dimmer during the first week it must be washed and isolated. If it became dimmer during the second week it must be torn out, and that which is torn out must be burnt, and it is necessary for a patch to be put on. Rabbi Nehemiah says: a patch is not necessary.","2989":"If the nega reappears on the garment, the patch is protected. If it reappears on the patch the garment must be burned. One who makes a patch from a garment that was isolated and then pronounced pure, and then the nega reappeared on the garment, the patch must be burned. If it reappeared on the patch, the first garment must be burned, and the patch serves the second garment while the two signs are under observation.","2990":"A screen that had colored and white stripes, a nega may effectively spread from one to the other. They asked Rabbi Eliezer: But the white stripe is separate? He replied: I have heard no ruling on this question. Rabbi Judah ben Batera said to him: Shall I derive the answer? He replied: If this would confirm the words of the sages, then yes! He said back: It is possible that it would remain on it in an unchanged condition for two weeks, and that which remains unchanged on garments for two weeks is unclean. He said to him: You are a great sage, for you have confirmed the words of the sages. A spreading that is close to the original nega is effective however small it may be. One that is distant is effective only if it is of the size of a split bean. And one that reappears is effective only if it is of the size of a split bean.","2991":"The warp and the woof can contract the uncleanness of negaim immediately. Rabbi Judah says: the warp, only after it has been boiled, but the woof immediately. And bundles of flax after they have been bleached. How much must there be in a coil for it to be capable of contracting the uncleanness of negaim? Enough to weave from it a piece of three fingerbreadths square, either warp  or woof, even if it is all warp or all woof. If it consisted of broken threads it does not contract the uncleanness of negaim. Rabbi Judah says: even if the thread was broken only in one place, and he knotted together, it does not contract the uncleanness of negaim.","2992":"One who winds a thread from one coil to another, or from one spool to another, or from the upper beam to the lower beam, and so also in the case of the two sides of a shirt, if a nega appears on the one, the other remains clean. If it appears on the shedded woof or on the standing warp, they become susceptible to the uncleanness of negaim immediately. Rabbi Shimon says: the warp may contract uncleanness only if it is closely ordered.","2993":"If a nega appeared on the standing warp, the already woven cloth remains clean. If it appeared on the already woven cloth, the standing warp remains clean. If it appeared on a sheet, he must also burn the fringes. If it appeared on the fringes the sheet remains clean. A shirt on which a nega appeared affords protection to its hems, even though they are of purple wool.","2994":"Any object that is susceptible to corpse uncleanness, though not susceptible to midras uncleanness, is still susceptible to negaim uncleanness. For instance: the sail of a ship, a curtain, the forehead band of a hair-net, the wrappings of scrolls, a coiled belt, the straps of a shoe or sandal that are at least as wide as a split bean, Behold these are susceptible to the uncleanness of negaim. A thick cloak on which a nega appeared: Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: unless it appears on the texture and on the stuffing. A skin bottle or a shepherd's leather wallet are inspected in the position in which they are used, and a nega may effectively spread from its inner side to its outer side and from its  outer side to its inner side.","2995":"If a garment that had been isolated was mixed up with others, all are clean. If it was cut up and made into shreds, it is clean, and benefit may be derived from it. But if a garment that had been certified unclean was mixed up with others, all are unclean. If it was cut up and made into shreds it also remains unclean and it is forbidden to have any benefit from it.","2996":"All houses may contract negaim uncleanness, except those of non-Jews. If one bought houses from non-Jews, any it must be inspected as if they had then first appeared. A round house, a triangular house, or a house built on a ship, on a raft or on four beams, is not susceptible to negaim uncleanness. But if it was four-sided, even if it was built on four pillars, it is susceptible to uncleanness.","2997":"A house, one of whose walls was covered with marble, with rock, with bricks or with earth, is pure. A house that did not have in it stones, wood or earth, and a nega appeared in it and  afterwards stones, wood and earth were brought into it, it remains clean. So also a garment in which there was no woven part that was three fingerbreadths square and a nega appeared in it and afterwards there was woven into it a piece of cloth three fingerbreadths square, it remains clean. A house does is not susceptible to negaim uncleanness unless there are in it stones, wood and earth.","2998":"And how many stones must there be in it for it to be susceptible to negaim? Rabbi Ishmael says: four. Rabbi Akiva says: eight. For Rabbi Ishmael used to say: a nega is not a cause of uncleanness unless it appeared in the size of two split beans on two stones or on one stone. Rabbi Akiva say: unless it appears in the size of two split beans on two stones, and not on one stone. Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Shimon says: unless it appears in the size of two split  beans, on two stones, on two walls in a corner, Its length being that of two split beans and its breadth that of one split bean.","2999":"And how much wood must be in the wall for it to susceptible? Enough to be set under the lintel. Rabbi Judah says: it must suffice to make the support at the back of the lintel. And how much earth must be in the wall for it to susceptible? Such as would suffice to fill up the space between one row of stones and another. The walls of a cattle-trough or the walls of a partition are not susceptible to the uncleanness of negaim. A house in Jerusalem or in any place outside the land of Israel is not susceptible to the uncleanness of negaim.","3000":"What is the procedure for the inspection of a house? \"The owner of the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, \"Something like a plague has appeared upon my house\" (Leviticus 14:35). Even if he is a learned sage and knows that it is definitely a nega, he may not speak with certainty saying, \"A plague has appeared upon my house,\" but rather, \"Something like a plague has appeared upon my house.\" \"The priest shall order the house cleared before the priest enters to examine the plague, so that nothing in the house may become unclean; after that the priest shall enter to examine the house.\" Even bundles of wood and even bundles of reeds must be removed, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Shimon said: clearing keeps him occupied. Rabbi Meir said: But which of his goods could become unclean? If you were to say, his articles of wood, of cloth or of metal, he could immerse them and they will become clean. What is it that the Torah has spared? His earthenware, even his cruse and his bucket. If the Torah thus spared a man's humble possessions, how much more so would it spare his cherished possessions! If for his material possessions, how much more so for the life of his sons and daughters! If for the possessions of a wicked man, how much more so for the possessions of a righteous one!","3001":"The priest must not go into his own house to isolate it, nor may he stand within the house in which there is a nega. Rather, he must stand at the door of the house in which is there is a nega, and isolate it from there, as it is said, \"The priest shall come out of the house to the entrance of the house, and close up the house for seven days\" (Leviticus 14:38). He comes again at the end of the week and inspects the sign to see if it spread. \"The priest shall order the stones with the plague in them to be pulled out and cast outside the city into an unclean place\" (v.. \"They shall take other stones and replace those stones with them, and take other dirt and plaster the house\" (v.. He must not take stones from the one side and bring them to the other; nor earth from the one side and bring it to the other; nor lime from anywhere. He must not bring one stone to replace two, nor two to replace one. But he can bring two to replace two or to replace three or to replace four. From here they have said: Woe to the wicked, woe to his neighbor. Both must take out the stones, both must scrape the walls, and both must bring the new stones. He alone, however, brings the earth, as it is said, \"And he shall take other coating and plaster the house.\"  His neighbor need not join with him in the plastering.","3002":"He comes again at the end of the week and inspects the nega. If it has returned, \"He shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them out of the city into an unclean place\" (Leviticus 14:45). A spreading that adjoins the original nega is effective however small it may be; One that is distant must be no less than the size of a split bean. And a nega that returns in houses must be no less than the size of two split  beans.","3003":"There are ten laws concerning the negaim in houses:(1 + If during the first week a nega became faint or disappeared, it must be scraped and is then clean. (3 + If during the second week it became faint or disappeared, it must be scraped and the owner must bring the birds. If it spread during the first week, the stones must be taken out and the wall scraped and plastered, and another week must be allowed. If it then returned the entire house must be pulled down; If it did not return, the birds must be brought. If it remained unchanged during the first week but spread during the second week, the stones must be taken out and the wall scraped and plastered, and another week must be allowed. If it then returned, the house must be pulled down; If it did not return the birds  must be brought. If it remained unchanged in both weeks, the stones must be taken out, and the wall scraped and plastered, and a week must be allowed. If it then returned the house  must be pulled down; If it did not return, the birds  must be brought. If before cleanness was attained through the birds a new nega appeared, the house must be pulled down; But if it appeared after cleanness through the birds had been attained, it must be inspected as if it had appeared for the first time.","3004":"In the case of a stone in a corner, when the stone is taken out it, he must take it all out; But when the house is torn down he tears down his own part and leaves that which belongs to his neighbor. Thus it follows that there is a greater stringency for taking out than for tearing down. Rabbi Eliezer says: if a house is built of rows of head stones and small stones, and a nega appears on a head stone, all of it must be taken out; but if it appeared on the  small stones, he takes out his stones and leaves the others.","3005":"A house in which a nega appeared if it had an upper chamber above it, the beams are considered part of the upper chamber. If the nega appeared in the upper chamber the beams are considered part of the lower room. If there was no upper chamber above it, its stones and wood and earth must be torn down with it. He may save the frames and the window lattices. Rabbi Judah says: a frame that is built over the house must be torn down with it. Its stones and wood and earth convey uncleanness if they are of the minimum size of an olive. Rabbi Eliezer Hisma says: whatever their size.","3006":"A house that has been isolated conveys uncleanness from its inside; And one that has been certified unclean, both from its inside and from its outside. Both convey uncleanness  if one enters in.","3007":"If one who builds in cleanliness with stones from a house that was isolated and the nega returned to the former house, the stones must be taken out. If it returned to the stones, the first house must be torn down, and the stones serve the second house while the signs are under observation.","3008":"If a house overshadowed a house with a nega and so also if a tree overshadowed a house with a nega, anyone who enters the outer of the two remains clean, the words of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah. Rabbi Eliezer said:  if one stone of it causes uncleanness by entering, should not the house itself cause uncleanness by entering?","3009":"If an unclean person stood under a tree and a clean person passed by, the latter becomes unclean. If a clean person stood under a tree and an unclean one passed by, the former remains clean. If the latter stood still, the former becomes unclean. Similarly in the case of a leprous stone he remains clean. But if it was set down he becomes unclean.","3010":"If a person who was clean put his head and the greater part of his body inside an unclean house, he becomes unclean. And if an unclean man put his head and the greater part of his body inside a clean house he causes it to be unclean. If he put three fingerbreadths square of a clean cloak into an unclean house, the cloak becomes unclean; And if he put even the size of an olive of an unclean cloak into a clean house, the house becomes unclean.","3011":"If a person entered a house afflicted with a nega, carrying his clothes upon his shoulders, and his sandals and rings in his hands, both he and they become unclean immediately. If, however, he was wearing his clothes and had his sandals on his feet and his rings on his hands, he becomes unclean immediately, but they remain clean, unless he stayed as much time as is required for the eating of half a loaf of wheat bread and not of barley bread, while in a reclining posture and eating with some condiment.","3012":"If he was standing inside, and he stretched his hands outside, with his rings on his hands, if he stayed inside as much time as is required for the eating of half a loaf, they become unclean. If he was standing outside, stretching his hands inside, with his rings on his hands: Rabbi Judah says that they are unclean immediately, But the sages say: only after he leaves them there as much time as is required for the eating of half a loaf. They said to Rabbi Judah: if when all his body is unclean he does not render that which is on him unclean unless he stayed there long enough to eat half a loaf, when all of his body is not unclean, is it not logical that he should not render that which is on him unclean unless he stayed there long enough to eat half a loaf?","3013":"If a metzora entered a house all the vessels in it, even up to the roof beams, become unclean. Rabbi Shimon says: only up to a height of four cubits. Vessels become unclean immediately. Rabbi Judah says: only if the metzora stayed there as much time as is required for the lighting of a lamp.","3014":"If he enters a synagogue, a partition ten handbreadths high and four cubits wide must be made for him. He should enter first and come out last. Any vessel that affords protection by having a tightly fitting cover in the tent of a corpse affords protection by a tightly fitting cover in the house of one afflicted by a nega, And whatsoever affords protection when covered in the tent of a corpse affords protection when covered in the house of one afflicted with a nega, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says:  any vessel that affords protection by having a tightly fitting cover in the tent of a corpse affords protection when covered in the house of one afflicted with a nega; and whatsoever affords protection when covered in the tent of  a corpse remains clean even when uncovered in a leprous house.","3015":"How would they purify a metzora?A new earthenware flask and a quarter of a log of living water was put in it. Two undomesticated birds are also brought. One of these was slaughtered over the earthenware vessel and over the living water. A hole was dug and it was buried in his presence. Cedarwood, hyssop and scarlet wool were taken and bound together with the remaining ends of the strip of wool. Near to these were brought the tips of the wings and the tip of the tail of the second bird. All were dipped together, and sprinkled upon the back of the metzora's hand seven times. Some say that the sprinkling was done upon his forehead. In the same manner one would sprinkle on the lintel of a house from the outside.","3016":"He now comes to set free the living bird. He does not turn his face towards the sea or towards the city or towards the wilderness, for it is said, \"But he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field\" (Leviticus 14:53). He now comes to shave off the hair of the metzora. He passes a razor over the whole of his skin, and he the metzora washes his clothes and immerses himself. He is then clean so far as to not convey uncleanness by entrance, but he still conveys uncleanness as does a sheretz. He may enter within the walls of Jerusalem, but must keep away from his house for seven days, and he is forbidden to have intercourse.","3017":"On the seventh day he shaves off his hair a second time in the manner of the first shaving, he washes his garments and immerses  himself. He is clean in so far as not to convey uncleanness as a sheretz, but he was still like a tevul yom. He may eat second tithe. After sunset he may eat terumah. After he had brought his offering of atonement, he may also eat sacred things. Thus there are three grades in the  purification of a metzora and three grades in the purification of a woman after child birth.","3018":"There are three who must shave their hair, and their shaving of it is a commandment: the nazirite, the metzora, and the Levites. If any of these cut their hair but not with a razor, or if they left even two remaining hairs, their act is of no validity.","3019":"With regard to the two birds: the commandment is that they be alike in appearance, in size and in price; and they must be purchased at the same time. But even if they are not alike they are valid; And if one was purchased on one day and the other the next they are also valid. If after one of the birds had been slaughtered it was found that it was not wild, a partner must be purchased for the second, and the first may be eaten. If after it had been slaughtered it was found to terefah, a partner must be purchased for the second and the first may be made use of. If the blood had been spilled out, the bird that was to be let go must be left to die. If the one that was to be let go died, the blood must be spilled out.","3020":"The mitzvah of the cedarwood is for it to be one cubit in length, and in thickness a quarter of that of the leg of a bed, when one leg is divided into two halves and these two into four. The mitzvah of the hyssop is that it should be neither ezovyon nor blue hyssop nor Roman hyssop nor wild hyssop nor any kind of hyssop that has an accompanying name.","3021":"On the eighth day he would bring three beasts: a sin-offering, a guilt-offering and a whole burnt-offering. And a poor man would bring a sin-offering of a bird and a burnt-offering of a bird.","3022":"He comes to the guilt-offering and he puts his two hands on it. He then slaughters it. Two priests receive its blood, one in a vessel and the other in his hand. He who received it in the vessel proceeded to sprinkle it on the wall of the altar. The one who received it in his hand would approach the metzora. The metzora had in the meantime immersed himself in the chamber of the metzoraim. He would come and stand at the Nikanor gate. Rabbi Judah says: he did not require immersion.","3023":"The metzora put in his head inside and the priest applied the blood to the tip of his ear; He put in his hand and the priest applied the blood to the thumb of his hand. He put in his foot and the priest applied the blood to the big toe of his foot. Rabbi Judah says: he put in all three at the same time. If he had no thumb on his hand or no big toe on his foot or no right ear he could never become clean. Rabbi Eliezer says: the blood is applied to the place where they were. Rabbi Shimon says: if he applied it to the left side, the obligation has been fulfilled.","3024":"The priest then took some of the contents of the log of oil and poured it into his colleague's hand; And if he poured it into his own hand, the obligation is fulfilled. He then dipped his right forefinger in the oil and sprinkled it seven times towards the Holy of Holies, dipping it for every sprinkling. He then approached the metzora, to the same places that he applied the blood he now applied the oil, as it is said, \"Over the same places as the blood of the guilt offering; 29 and what is left of the oil in his palm the priest shall put on the head of the one being cleansed, to make expiation for him before the Lord.\" (Leviticus 14:28-29). If he \"put upon,\" he has made atonement, but if he did not \"put upon,\" he did not make atonement, the words of Rabbi Akiba. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: these are but the remainders of the mitzvah. Whether he \"put upon\" or did not \"put upon,\" atonement is made, only it is accounted to him as if he did not make atonement.

Consequently, she may touch the vessel, as second-degree ritual impurity does not render a vessel impure.

But the stone that serves as buttress to the buttressing stone is clean.","3119":"These are clean if they are deficient:An olive-sized portion of a corpse; An olive-sized portion of nezel, A ladleful of corpse-mold, A quarter of a log of blood, A bone of the size of a barley-corn, And a limb severed from a living person, the bone of which limb is deficient.","3120":"A backbone or a skull made up from the bones of two corpses, A quarter of a log of blood from two corpses, A quarter of a kav of bones from two corpses, A limb of a corpse from two corpses, And a limb severed from a living person, such a limb being made up from two persons, Rabbi Akiva declares the all unclean But the sages declare them clean.","3121":"A bone the size of a barley-corn that is divided into two: Rabbi Akiva declares it unclean But Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri declares it clean. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: they did not say 'bones\u2019 the size of a barley-corn, but \u2018bone\u2019 the size of a barley-corn. A quarter of a kav of bones crushed fine, and there is not a single bone the size of a barley-corn: Rabbi Shimon declares it clean But the sages unclean. A limb severed from a living person which has been divided into two is clean. Rabbi Yose declares it unclean; But he agrees that if it is taken from a living person by halves it is clean.","3122":"All objects that defile by overshadowing which were divided and then brought into a house: Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas declares clean. But the sages declare it unclean. What is the case? One who touches two pieces of nevelah,  each the size of half an olive, or carries them, Or, in the case of a corpse, if he touches a piece the size of half an olive and overshadows another piece the size of half an olive, Or if he touches a piece the size of half an olive and another piece the size of half an olive overshadows him, Or if he overshadows two pieces, each the size of half an olive, Or if he overshadows a piece the size of half an olive and another piece the size of half an olive overshadows him: Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas declares him clean, And the sages declare him unclean. But if he touches a piece the size of half an olive and another object  overshadows him and another piece the size of half an olive, Or if he overshadows a piece the size of half an olive and another object overshadows him and another piece the size of half an olive, he is clean. Rabbi Meir says: Even here Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas declares him clean and the sages declare him unclean. Every case is unclean  except a case of contact combined with carriage or of carriage combined with overshadowing. This is the general principle:  every object whose defilement proceeds from one cause is unclean, from two causes is clean.","3123":"If a ladleful of corpse-mold was scattered about in a house, the house is unclean But Rabbi Shimon declares it clean. If a quarter of a log of blood was absorbed in the ground of a house, the house is clean. If it was absorbed by a garment: if the garment is washed and a quarter of a log of blood emerges from it, it is unclean, if not, it is clean, since anything absorbed that cannot emerge is clean.","3124":"Blood which was poured out in the air: If the place where it fell was an incline and a person or vessel overshadowed part of it, he remains clean. If it was a cavity, or if the blood congealed,  he becomes unclean. If it was poured out on a threshold: If it inclined either inwards or outwards and the house overshadowed it that which is in the house is clean. If there was a cavity, or if it congealed, that which is in the house becomes unclean. Every part of a corpse is unclean except the teeth, hair and nails; But when they are joined to the corpse, they are all unclean.","3125":"How so? If the corpse was outside and its hair inside, the house is unclean. With regard to a bone which had upon it an olive-sized portion of flesh, if one brought part of it within so that the house was overshadowing it, the house is unclean. With regard to two bones which had upon them two pieces of flesh, each the size of half an olive, if one brought part of them within so that the house was overshadowing them, the house is unclean. But if the pieces of flesh were set into the bone by a person, the house is clean since connections created by human agency are not regarded as connections.","3126":"What is \u2018mixed blood? The blood of a corpse of which an eighth of a log came out during his lifetime and an eighth after death, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Ishmael says: a quarter of a log during his lifetime and a quarter after death. If a quarter of a log is taken from both of these: Rabbi Elazar bar Judah says: both of these are as water. What then is \u2018mixed blood\u2019? It is that of a crucified person whose blood is streaming forth and under whom is found a quarter of a log of blood it is unclean. However a corpse whose blood drips forth and under whom is found a quarter of a log of blood, the blood is clean. Rabbi Judah says: not so, but that which streams forth is clean and that which drips forth   is unclean.","3127":"For an olive-sized portion of a corpse, an opening in the room in which it is found of one handbreadth square, and for a whole corpse, an opening of four handbreadths square, is enough to prevent the uncleanness from spreading to the other openings; But for allowing the uncleanness to go out, an opening of one handbreadth square is enough. A portion greater than the size of an olive is as a whole corpse. Rabbi Yose says: only the spine and the skull are as a whole corpse.","3128":"An object one handbreadth square and one handbreadth high conveys uncleanness and blocks uncleanness. How does it block uncleanness? In the case of a covered drain beneath a house, if it has a space a handbreadth wide and its outlet was a handbreadth wide, and there is uncleanness inside it, the house remains clean; And when there is uncleanness in the house, that which is within the drain remains clean, for the manner of the uncleanness is to go out and not to go in. If it had a space one handbreadth wide but its outlet was not one handbreadth wide, when there is uncleanness in it, the house becomes unclean; But when there is uncleanness in the house, that which is within it remains clean, for the manner of the uncleanness is to go out and not to go in. If it did not have a space one handbreadth wide and its outlet was not one handbreadth wide, when there is uncleanness within it, the house becomes unclean; And when there is uncleanness in the house, it also becomes unclean. It makes no difference if the cavity was carved out by water or by a sheretz or if it had been eaten out by salt. And similarly if it is in a row of stones or a pile of beams. Rabbi Judah says: any \"tent\" not made by a person is not considered a tent\u2019. But he agrees that crevices and crags can be considered as \u2018tents\u2019.","3129":"A cupboard  standing in the open air: If there is uncleanness within it, vessels in the niches in the thickness of its walls remain clean. If there is uncleanness in the niches in its thickness, vessels inside the cupboard remain clean. Rabbi Yose says: half and half. When it is standing inside a house: If there is uncleanness inside the cupboard, the house is unclean; If there is uncleanness in the house that which is within the cupboard remains clean, for the manner of uncleanness is to go out and not to go in. Vessels which are between the cupboard and the ground, or between it and the wall, or between it and the roof-beams: If there is a space of one cubic handbreadth there, they become unclean. If not they remain clean. If there is uncleanness there, the house becomes unclean.","3130":"With regard to a drawer of the cupboard, which is one cubic handbreadth, but whose outlet is not a square handbreadth, if there is uncleanness inside it, the house becomes unclean; But if there is uncleanness in the house, that which is within the drawer remains clean, for the manner of uncleanness is to go out and not to go in. Rabbi Yose declares the house clean, since he can remove the uncleanness by halves or burn it where it stands.","3131":"In the case where the cupboard is standing in the doorway and is opened outward, if there is uncleanness inside it, the house remains clean. If there is uncleanness in the house, that which is within the cupboard becomes unclean, for the manner of uncleanness is to go out and not to go in. If its wheeled base protruded three fingerbreadths behind it and there was uncleanness inside it under the roof-beams, the house remains clean. When does this ruling apply? When there is a space of one cubic handbreadth,   when it is not easily detachable,   and when the cupboard is of the stipulated size.","3132":"With regard to an oven which stood in a house, with its outlet curved to the outside of the house, and those burying a corpse overshadowed it: Bet Shammai says: all becomes unclean. Bet Hillel says: the oven becomes unclean, but the house remains clean. Rabbi Akiva says: even the oven remains clean.","3133":"With regard to a hatch  between the house and the upper story, if there was a pot placed over it and it was perforated by a hole of sufficient size to admit liquid: Bet Shammai says: all becomes unclean. Bet Hillel says: the pot becomes unclean but the upper story remains clean. Rabbi Akiva says: all remains clean.","3134":"If the pot was whole:Bet Hillel says: it protects all from uncleanness.A vessel of earthenware can protect everything in it from contracting impurity, according to Beth Hillel. Bet Shammai says: it protects only food, drink and earthenware vessels.But Beth Shammai says: \u201cIt protects only food and liquids and other vessels of earthenware.\u201d Bet Hillel changed their opinion and taught as Bet Shammai.Beth Hillel said to them: \u201cWhy?\u201d Beth Shammai said to them:  \u201cBecause it is itself impure with respect to an ignoramus, and no impure vessel can screen against impurity.\u201d Beth Hillel said to them:  \u201cAnd did you not pronounce pure the food and liquids inside it?\u201d Beth Shammai said to them:  \u201cWhen we pronounced pure the food and liquids inside it, we pronounced them pure for him the ignoramus only, but when you pronounced the vessel pure you pronounced it pure for yourself and for him.\u201d Then Beth Hillel changed their mind and taught according to the opinion of Beth Shammai.","3135":"With regard to a flagon that is full of pure liquid, the flagon is defiled with seven days' impurity but the liquid remains clean. But if one poured it out into another vessel, it becomes unclean. If a woman was kneading in the upper story at a trough, the woman and the trough become unclean with seven days impurity, but the dough remains clean But if one turned it out into another vessel, it becomes unclean. Bet Hillel changed their opinion and taught as Bet Shammai.","3136":"If lying over the hatch there were vessels made of dung, vessels of stone, or vessels of unbaked earth, everything in the upper story remains clean. If it was a vessel known to be clean for holy things or for the water of purification, everything remains clean, since everyone is trusted with regard to matters of purification. For clean vessels and earthenware vessels that are known to be clean protect with the walls of \u2018tents'.","3137":"How so? If there was a cistern or a cellar in a house and a large basket was placed over it, the contents of the cistern or cellar remain clean. But if it was a well with its upper edge level with the ground or a deficient   beehive upon which the basket was placed, the contents become unclean. If it was a smooth board or netting without rims, the contents remain clean. For vessels cannot protect along with walls of an ohel unless they themselves have walls. How much must the wall be? A handbreadth. If there was half a handbreadth on one side and half a handbreadth on the other, it is not considered a wall, as there must be a whole handbreadth on one object.","3138":"Just as they protect inside so they protect outside. How so?  In the case of a large basket supported on pegs on the outside of an ohel, If there was uncleanness beneath it, vessels in the basket remain clean. But if it was next to the wall of a courtyard or of a garden, it does not protect. In the case of a beam placed across from one wall to an other, with a pot hanging from it, if there was uncleanness beneath it, Rabbi Akiva declares the vessels inside it to be clean, But the sages declare them unclean.","3139":"Both persons and vessels can form \u2018tents\u2019 to bring uncleanness, but not to protect objects so that they remain clean. How so? There are four people carrying a chest: If there is uncleanness beneath it, vessels upon it become unclean. If there is uncleanness upon it, vessels beneath it become unclean. Rabbi Eliezer declares them clean. If the chest is placed upon four vessels, even if they are vessels made of dung, vessels of stone, or vessels of unbaked earth, If there is uncleanness beneath the chest, vessels upon it become unclean. If there is uncleanness beneath it, vessels upon it become unclean. If the chest is placed on four stones or on any living creature, If there is uncleanness beneath it, vessels upon it remain clean. If there is uncleanness upon it vessels beneath it remain clean.","3140":"If corpse-bearers were passing along a portico and one of them shut a door and   locked it with a key, If the door can remain in its position on its own,the contents of the house remain clean, But if not, they become unclean. Similarly in the case of a barrel of dried figs or a basket of straw placed in a window, If the dried figs or the straw can remain in their position on their own, the contents of the room remain clean, But if not they become unclean. In the case of a house partitioned off by wine-jars, which had been plastered with clay, If the clay can remain in its position on its own, the space partitioned off remains clean, But if not, it becomes unclean.","3141":"A wall serving a house is treated as if it was separate halves. How so? A wall serving an open space, that has uncleanness within it: If it is in the inward half, the house is unclean, But what is above the wall   remains clean. If it is in the outward half, the house remains clean, But what is above the wall becomes unclean. If it is exactly in the middle, the house becomes unclean, And as for what is above, Rabbi Meir declares it unclean, But the sages declare it clean. Rabbi Judah says: the whole of the wall belongs to the house.","3142":"In the case of a wall between two houses and there is uncleanness within it, The house nearer to the uncleanness is unclean, And the house nearer to the clean part is clean. If the uncleanness is in the middle, both are unclean. If there is uncleanness in one of the houses and there are vessels in the thickness of the wall: Those in the half nearer the uncleanness are unclean, Those in the half nearer the clean house are clean, And those in the middle are unclean. With regard to the plaster-work between the house and the upper story, and there is uncleanness in it: If it is in the lower half, the house below is unclean and the upper story is clean If it is in the upper half, the upper story is unclean and the house is clean: If it is in the middle, both are unclean. If there is uncleanness in either the house or the upper story and there are vessels inside the plaster-work, Those in the half nearer the uncleanness are unclean, And those in the half nearer the clean space are clean. If they are in the middle, they are unclean. Rabbi Judah says: all the plaster-work is considered as part of the upper story.","3143":"In the case of uncleanness among the roof-beams, with a covering beneath it thin as thin as garlic-skin, If there is a space within of a cubic handbreadth, everything becomes unclean. If there is not a space of a cubic handbreadth, the uncleanness is considered plugged up. If the uncleanness was visible within the house, in either case the house becomes unclean.","3144":"A house serving a wall is subject to the principle of garlic-skin. How so? In the case of a wall between two tomb-niches or two caverns, If there is uncleanness in them and vessels in the walls, and there is a covering thin as garlic-skin over them, they remain clean. If the uncleanness is in the wall and the vessels are in them, and there is a covering thin as garlic-skin over the uncleanness, they remain clean. If there is uncleanness beneath a pillar, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards.","3145":"Vessels beneath the flowerlike top of a pillar remain clean. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri declares them unclean. In the case of the uncleanness and the vessels being together beneath the flowerlike top of a pillar: If there is a space of one cubic handbreadth there, the vessels become unclean; If not, they remain clean. In the case of two wall-cupboards, one beside the other, or one above the other, if one of them was opened, both it and the house become unclean, but its companion remains clean. The wall-cupboard is considered as if it is plugged up, and it is subject to the principle of halves for conveying uncleanness into the house.","3146":"If there is uncleanness in a wall, in a space of one cubic handbreadth, all upper stories above it, even if there are ten of them, are unclean. If there was a single upper story built over two houses, that one becomes unclean but all upper stories above it remain clean. In a beach- wall, uncleanness cleaves upwards and downward. With regard to a solid tomb monument,  a person who touches it from the side remains clean, since its uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards. But if there was a free space of a cubic handbreadth in the place where the uncleanness was, a person touching it anywhere becomes unclean, because it is like a closed grave. If he supported sukkot on the monument they become unclean. Rabbi Judah declares them clean.","3147":"All sloping parts of \u2018tents\u2019 are reckoned like \u2018tents.' A \u2018tent\u2019 whose sides sloped downwards and finished off one fingerbreadth from the ground: If there is uncleanness in the \u2018tent\u2019, vessels beneath the slope become unclean. If there is uncleanness beneath the slope, vessels in the \u2018tent\u2019 become unclean. If there is uncleanness within, a person who touches the tent from the inside acquires a seven days\u2019 defilement,   but from the outside, a defilement lasting till evening. If there had been uncleanness outside, a person who touches the \u2018tent\u2019 from the outside acquires a seven days\u2019 defilement, but from the inside, a defilement lasting till evening. If there was a portion of uncleanness the size of half an olive touching it from inside and half an olive from the outside, a person who touches the \u2018tent\u2019 either from within or without acquires a defilement lasting till evening. If a part of the \u2018tent\u2019 side trailed along the ground, when there is uncleanness beneath or above this part, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards. In the case of a \u2018tent\u2019 erected in an upper story, with a portion of its side trailing over the hatch between the house and the upper story: Rabbi Yose says it does protect. Rabbi Shimon says: it does not protect unless it put up in the usual manner of erecting tents.","3148":"If a corpse is in a house in which there are many doors, they all become unclean. If one of them was opened, that one becomes unclean but all the rest remain clean. If he intended to carry out the corpse through one of them or through a window of four hand breadths square, he protects all the other doors. Bet Shammai says: the intention must have been formed before the person died. Bet Hillel say: even after he died. If a door was blocked up and it was decided to open it: Bet Shammai says: it is effective   as soon he opens a a space four handbreadths square. Bet Hillel says: as soon as the process has begun. They agree, however, that when making an opening for the first time, four handbreadths must be opened up.","3149":"If a woman was having great difficulty giving birth and they carried her out from one house to another, the first house is doubtfully unclean and the second is certainly unclean. Rabbi Judah said: When is this so? When she is carried out supported by the armpits, but if she was able to walk, the first house remains clean, for after the \"tomb\" has been opened there is no possibility of walking, For stillborn children are not deemed to have opened the \"tomb\" until they present a head rounded like a spindle-knob.","3150":"If at the birth of twins the first came out dead and the second came out alive, the live one is clean. If the first was alive and the second dead, the live child is unclean. Rabbi Meir says: if they were in one sac, the live child is unclean,  but if there were two sacs, it remains clean.","3151":"If a woman is having trouble giving birth, they cut up the child in her womb and brings it forth limb by limb, because her life comes before the life of the child. But if the greater part has come out, one may not touch it, for one may not set aside one person's life for that of another.","3152":"Some things bring forth uncleanness and also a protect against it; Some things bring forth uncleanness but do not protect against it; Some things protect but do not bring forth; Some things do not bring forth nor do they protect. The following bring forth and protect against impurity: A chest,  a box, a cupboard, a beehive of straw, a beehive of reeds, or the water-tank of an Alexandrian  ship, such of which objects have flat bottoms  and can contain at least forty seahs  liquid measure or two kors  dry measure. Also a curtain, a leather apron, a leather bedspread,  a sheet, a matting underlay  or a mat when made into tents. A herd of cattle, unclean or clean, packs  of wild animals or birds, a resting bird, a shady place that a woman makes for her son among the ears of corn; The iris, the ivy, squitting cucumber, Greek gourds   and clean foodstuffs. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri did not agree with regard to clean foodstuffs except in the case of a cake of dried figs.","3153":"Projections from a wall, balconies,   dovecotes, crevices and crags, grottoes,   overhanging pinnacles, interlaced boughs and protruding stones as long as they are cable of sustaining thin plasterwork, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say a medium plasterwork. What are interlaced boughs? A tree which casts shade over the ground. Protruding stones? Stones that project from a wall.","3154":"The following bring impurity but do not protect against it: A chest, a box, a cupboard, a beehive of straw, a beehive of reeds, or the water tank of an Alexandrian ship, such of which objects have flat bottoms but cannot contain forty se'ahs of liquid measure or two kors dry measure. A curtain, a leather apron, a leather undercover, a sheet, a matting underlay or a mat when not made into tents. Cattle or wild animals when they are dead, and foodstuffs that are liable to become unclean. In addition to these, a human-powered mill.","3155":"The following protect against impurity but do not bring it: A loom with the woof spread out, the ropes of a bed, waste baskets, and window-lattices.","3156":"The following neither bring impurity nor protect against it:Seeds, plants still attached to the ground, except for the plants mentioned above, A lump of hail, snow, frost, ice and salt. Anything that hops from one place to another, or leaps from one place to another, a flying bird. A loosely-flapping garment, or a ship floating freely on the water. If the ship were tied with something that can keep it steady, or a stone were placed so as to hold down the garment, it can bring uncleanness. Rabbi Yose says: a house on a ship cannot bring uncleanness.","3157":"Two earthenware jars in which there are two pieces of corpse the size of half an olive, sealed with tightly fitting lids, lying in a house, they remain clean, but the house becomes unclean. If one of them was opened, that jar and the house become unclean, but the other remains clean. A similarly with to two rooms that open into a house.","3158":"A beehive lying in the doorway with its mouth pointing outside:If an olive-sized portion of a corpse were placed below the part of the hive which is outside the house, Everything directly below or above that olive-sized portion becomes unclean; But everything that is not directly below or above that olive-sized portion, or that which is within the hive or within the house, remains clean.

When the uncleanness is directly below the hatchway, if he placed his leg above it, Rabbi Meir declares him unclean, But the sages say: if the uncleanness was in position before his leg, he becomes unclean, but if his leg was in position before the uncleanness, he remains clean. Rabbi Shimon says: in the case where two men's legs, one above the other, were in position before the uncleanness, if the first person withdrew his leg and the other person's leg was still there, the second remains clean, because the first person's leg was in position before the uncleanness.","3176":"If part of the uncleanness is in the house and part directly below the hatchway, the house becomes unclean, and what is directly above the uncleanness becomes unclean, the words of Meir. Rabbi Judah says: the house becomes unclean but what is directly above the uncleanness remains clean. Rabbi Yose says: if there is sufficient of the uncleanness for it to be divided so that one part defiles the house and the other part defiles what is directly above the uncleanness, both spaces become unclean; if not, the house becomes unclean but what is directly above the uncleanness remains clean.","3177":"If there are multiple hatchways, one above the other,  and they each have an opening of one handbreadth square, if there is uncleanness in the house,  what is directly below the hatchways remains clean. If the uncleanness is directly below the hatchways, the house remains clean. In the case where the uncleanness is either in the house or directly below the hatchways, if something susceptible to uncleanness was placed either in the upper or the lower hatchway, everything becomes unclean. If the article is insusceptible to uncleanness, what is below becomes unclean, but what is above remains clean.","3178":"In a case where the hatchways do not have an opening of a square handbreadth:If there is uncleanness in the house, what is directly below the hatchways remains clean. If there is uncleanness directly below the hatchways, the house remains clean. In the case where the uncleanness is in the house, if an article whether susceptible to uncleanness or insusceptible to uncleanness was placed either in the upper or the lower hatchway, nothing becomes unclean except the lower story. In the case where the uncleanness is directly below the hatchways, if an article susceptible to uncleanness was placed either in the upper or lower hatchway, everything becomes unclean. If the article is insusceptible to uncleanness, whether it is placed in the upper or lower hatchway, nothing becomes unclean except the lower story.","3179":"In the case of a hatchway in a house with a pot placed below it that, if it was raised, its rims would not touch the edges of the hatchway: If there is uncleanness below, within or above the pot, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards. In the case where the pot was one handbreadth high off the ground, if there is uncleanness below it or in the house, what is below it and in the house becomes unclean, but what is within the pot or above it, remains clean. If the uncleanness is within or above the pot, everything becomes unclean.","3180":"In the case where the pot was placed on the side of the threshold of the house such that if it was raised it would touch the lintel over a space of a square handbreadth: If there is uncleanness below, within or above the pot, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards. In the case where it was one handbreadth high off the ground: If there is uncleanness below it or in the house, what is below it and in the house becomes unclean. If the uncleanness is within or above the pot, everything becomes unclean. In the case where the pot if raised would not touch the lintel over a space of a square handbreadth, or is joined to the lintel, if there is uncleanness below it, nothing is unclean except what is below the pot.","3181":"A house, which has been split into two: If there is uncleanness in the outer part, vessels in the inner part remain clean. If the uncleanness is in the inner part, vessels in the outer are clean: Bet Shammai says: when the split is four handbreadths wide; But Bet Hillel says: when the split is of any size. Rabbi Yose says in the name of Bet Hillel: when it is one handbreadth wide.","3182":"A portico which has been split into two: If there is uncleanness on the one side, vessels on the other side remain clean. If a person placed his leg or a reed above the split,  he has combined with the roof to bring the uncleanness. If he placed the reed on the ground, it does not form a passage for the uncleanness until it is one handbreadth off the ground.","3183":"A thick woolen jacket or a thick wooden block does not bring uncleanness until they are one handbreadth high off the ground. If garments are folded one above the other they do not bring uncleanness until the uppermost is one handbreadth high off the ground. If a person were placed there under the split in the portico: Bet Shammai says: he does not bring the uncleanness. But Bet Hillel says: a person is hollow and his uppermost side brings the uncleanness.","3184":"If a person was looking out of a window and overshadowed a funeral procession: Bet Shammai says: he does not bring uncleanness. But Bet Hillel says: he does bring the uncleanness. They agree that if he was dressed in his clothes or if there were two persons, one above the other, they bring the uncleanness.","3185":"If a person was lying on the threshold and the funeral procession overshadowed him: Bet Shammai says: he does not bring the uncleanness. But Bet Hillel says: he does bring the uncleanness.","3186":"In the case where the uncleanness was in the house and clean persons overshadowed him: Bet Shammai declares them clean, But Bet Hillel declares them unclean.","3187":"A dog which had eaten the flesh of a corpse and then died   and was lying over the threshold:Rabbi Meir says: if its neck has a thickness of one handbreadth it can bring the uncleanness, but if not, it does not bring the uncleanness. Rabbi Yose says: we examine to see where the uncleanness is. If it is beneath the lintel and inwards, the house becomes unclean; if from the lintel and outwards, the house remains clean. Rabbi Eliezer says: if its mouth points inwards, the house remains clean; if its mouth points outwards, the house becomes unclean, since the uncleanness goes out through its hind. Rabbi Judah ben Batera says: in either case the house becomes unclean. How long can the uncleanness remain in its entrails? Three whole days. If in the entrails of fishes or birds, as long as it takes for the uncleanness to fall in the fire and be consumed, the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Judah ben Batera says: in the case of fishes or birds, twenty-four hours.","3188":"A cellar in a house with a candlestick in it, whose calyx protrudes and an olive-basket is placed such that if the candlestick was taken away the olive-basket would still remain over the mouth of the cellar: Bet Shammai says: the cellar remains clean but the candlestick becomes unclean. Bet Hillel says: the candlestick also remains clean. But they agree that if the olive-basket would fall into the cellar if the candlestick was removed, all would become unclean.","3189":"Vessels that are between the rims of the olive-basket and the rims of the cellar, even to the depths, remain clean. If there is uncleanness in the cellar, the house becomes unclean. If there is uncleanness in the house, vessels in the walls of the cellar   remain clean, if the place where they are has a content of one cubic handbreadth;   if not, they become unclean. If the walls of the cellar are wider apart than those of the house, in either case the vessels remain clean.","3190":"A board placed over the mouth of a new oven,  overlapping it on all sides to the extent of a handbreadth, If there is uncleanness beneath the board, vessels above it remain clean; If there is uncleanness above it, vessels beneath it remain clean. In the case of an old oven, they become unclean. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri declares them clean. If the board is placed over the mouth of two ovens, if there is uncleanness between them, they become unclean. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri declares them clean.","3191":"Netting  placed  over the mouth of an oven, so that it is closed with a sealed lid: If there is uncleanness below the netting or above it, everything becomes unclean; But what is directly above the air-space of the oven remains clean. If there is uncleanness directly above the air-space of the oven, everything directly above it even to the sky becomes unclean.","3192":"In a case where the board is placed over the mouth of an old oven projects from either end to the extent of one handbreadth but not from the sides: If there is uncleanness under one end of the board, vessels under the other end remain clean. Rabbi Yose declares them unclean. A betach  does not bring uncleanness. If there was a projection in it: Rabbi Eliezer says: it still does not bring uncleanness. Rabbi Joshua says: we look at the betach as if it is not there, and the projection above brings uncleanness.","3193":"With regard to the shoe of a cradle, for which a hole had been made in the ceiling to bring it into the house below, If the hole is one handbreadth square, everything   becomes unclean; But if it was not one handbreadth square its uncleanness is reckoned as one reckons with cases of contact with a corpse.","3194":"With regard to the roof beams of a house and of the upper story which have no plaster ceiling upon them and are in a line, the upper ones exactly above the lower: If there is uncleanness beneath one of them, all beneath that one becomes unclean. If it is between a lower and an upper beam what is between them becomes unclean. If it is above the upper roof beams, what is directly above to the sky becomes unclean. In the case where the upper roof beams were over the gaps between the lower roof beams: If there is uncleanness beneath one of them, what is beneath all of them becomes unclean; If above them, what is directly above to the sky becomes unclean.","3195":"With regard to a beam which is placed across from one wall to another and which has uncleanness beneath it: If it is one handbreadth wide, it conveys uncleanness to everything beneath it; If it is not one handbreadth wide, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards. How much must its circumference be so that its width should be one handbreadth? If it is round, its circumference must be three handbreadths; If square, four handbreadths, since a square has a circumference one quarter greater than that of a circle.","3196":"With regard to a pillar lying on its side in the open air, If its circumference is twenty-four handbreadths, it brings uncleanness to everything under its side; But if it is not, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards.","3197":"If an olive-sized portion of a corpse is stuck to the threshold: Rabbi Eliezer declares the house unclean. Rabbi Joshua declares it clean. If it was placed beneath the threshold, the case is judged by the half in which the uncleanness is found. If it is stuck to the lintel, the house becomes unclean. Rabbi Yose declares it clean. If it was in the house, a person touching the lintel becomes unclean. As for a person touching the threshold: Rabbi Eliezer declares him unclean. Rabbi Joshua says: if he touches it at a point below a handbreadth from the surface he remains clean; above that handbreadth he becomes unclean.","3198":"One who makes a new light hole, its minimum size is that of a hole made by the large drill of the Temple chamber. The remains of a light-hole the size is two fingerbreadths high by a thumb-breadth broad. The following is considered the remains of a light-hole: a window that a person had blocked up but had not been able to finish being blocked up. A hole that was bored by water, or by reptiles or eaten away by salt: the minimum size is that of a fist. If he intended to use it, its minimum size is one handbreadth square; For lighting its minimum size is that of a hole made by the drill. The holes in grating  or lattice-work  may be joined together to form an opening the size of a hole made by the drill, according to the opinion of Bet Shammai. Bet Hillel says: unless there is a hole of the size made by the drill in one place. The above applies for purposes of allowing the uncleanness to come in or to go out. Rabbi Shimon says: only for allowing the uncleanness to come in; but for allowing the uncleanness to go out the minimum size is one handbreadth square.","3199":"With regard to a window made for letting in air, its minimum size is that of a hole made by the drill. If a house was built outside it, its minimum size becomes one handbreadth square. If a roof was placed at the height of the middle of the window, the minimum size of the lower part is one handbreadth square and of the upper part that of a hole made by the drill.","3200":"With regard to a hole in the door: Its minimum size is that of a fist, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Tarfon says: one handbreadth square. If the carpenter had left a space at the bottom or the top of the door or if one had shut the door but not closed it tightly, or if the wind blew it open, the minimum size is that of a fist.","3201":"One who makes a place for a rod, for tongs, or a lamp, the minimum size is whatever is needful, according to the word of Bet Shammai. Bet Hillel says: one handbreadth square. If it was made for a peep-hole, for speaking through to his fellow, or for human use, the minimum size is one handbreadth square.","3202":"The following objects serve to reduce the area of a square handbreadth:A portion of less than an olive-size of flesh of a corpse reduces the opening for uncleanness that is caused by a quarter of a kav of bones from a corpse; A portion of less than a barley-corn size of bone reduces the opening for uncleanness that is caused by an olive-sized portion of flesh; Less than an olive-sized portion of a corpse, Less than an olive-sized portion of carrion, Less than a lentil-sized portion of sheretz; Less than an egg-sized portion of food; Produce growing next to the window, A cobweb having substance; The carcass of a clean bird that he did not intend to eat, And the carcass of an unclean bird that had been intended for food that had not been rendered susceptible to uncleanness, or which had been rendered susceptible to uncleanness but had not been intended for food.","3203":"The following do not reduce the area of the window: Bone does not reduce the area for other bones; Nor corpse flesh for other flesh; Nor an olive-sized portion of a corpse; Nor an olive-sized portion of carrion; Nor a lentil-sized portion of reptile; Nor an egg-sized portion of food; Nor produce growing in the windows; Nor a cobweb having no substance; Nor the carcass of a clean bird which had been intended for food; Nor the carcass of an unclean bird which had been intended for food and had been rendered susceptible to uncleanness; Nor warp and woof threads that have negaim; Nor a brick from a bet haperas, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: the brick can reduce, because the dust of the bet haperas is clean. This is the general rule: what is clean reduces the area, and what is unclean does not reduce it.","3204":"A projection brings uncleanness, whatever width it may be; But a balcony or rounded balcony when they are one handbreadth wide. What is a projection? That projection whose surface slopes downwards, And a balcony's surface slopes upwards. In what circumstances did they say that a projection brings uncleanness whatever width it may be? With regard to a projection which is three rows of stones, or twelve handbreadths, above the doorway. When higher than that, it brings uncleanness only if it is one handbreadth wide. Cornices  and carvings bring uncleanness when they are one handbreadth wide.","3205":"A projection that is above a doorway forms a passage for the uncleanness when it is one handbreadth wide; If above a window two fingerbreadths high or the size of a hole made by a drill, when of any width whatsoever. Rabbi Yose says: when of equal size to the particular window.","3206":"A rod above a doorway, even if one hundred cubits higher,  forms a passage for the uncleanness no matter its width, the words of Rabbi Joshua. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: don't be more stringent than the case of a projection.","3207":"In the case of a projection which goes all round the house, occupying space above the doorway to the extent of three fingerbreadths, if there is uncleanness in the house, vessels beneath the projection become unclean. If the uncleanness is beneath the projection: Rabbi Eliezer declares the house unclean, But Rabbi Joshua declares it clean. A similar rule applies to a courtyard surrounded by a portico.","3208":"With regard to two projections, one directly above the other, each having a width of one handbreadth and a space of one handbreadth between them: If there is uncleanness beneath them, what is beneath them becomes unclean; If it is between them, what is between them becomes unclean; Above them, everything directly above to the sky becomes unclean. If the upper projection overlapped the lower to the extent of one handbreadth: If there is uncleanness beneath or between them, what is beneath and between them becomes unclean; If it is above them, what is directly above to the sky becomes unclean. If the upper projection overlapped the lower to an extent of less than a handbreadth: If there is uncleanness beneath them, what is beneath and between them becomes unclean; If it is between them or beneath the overlapping part: Rabbi Eliezer says: what is beneath them and between them becomes unclean. Rabbi Joshua says: what is between them and beneath the overlapping part becomes unclean, but what is beneath the lower one remains clean.","3209":"If they had a width of a handbreadth but there was not a space of a handbreadth between them: If there is uncleanness beneath them, what is beneath becomes unclean; If it is between them or above them, everything directly above to the sky becomes unclean.","3210":"If they did not have a width of a handbreadth, whether there is a space of a handbreadth between them or whether there is not, if there is uncleanness beneath, between or above them, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards. A similar rule applies to two curtains, the lower one of which is one handbreadth high off the ground.","3211":"A thick woolen jacket or a thick wooden block does not bring uncleanness until they are one handbreadth high off the ground. If garments are folded one above the other they do not bring uncleanness until the uppermost is one handbreadth high off the ground. Tablets of wood placed one above the other do not bring uncleanness unless the uppermost is one handbreadth high off the ground; But if they were of marble, the uncleanness  cleaves upwards and downwards.","3212":"With regard to wooden tablets which touch each other at their corners, and are one handbreadth high off the ground: If there is uncleanness beneath one of them, a person touching the second tablet becomes defiled with seven-day defilement. Vessels under the first tablet become unclean; but those under the second remain clean. A table does not bring uncleanness unless it contains a square of at least one handbreadth.","3213":"With regard to jars standing on their bottoms or lying on their sides in the open air and touching one another to the extent of a handbreadth: If there is uncleanness beneath one of them, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards. When does this rule apply? When the jars are clean. But in the case where they were unclean  or one handbreadth high off the ground, if there is uncleanness beneath one of them, what is beneath all becomes unclean.","3214":"With regard to a house, sectioned off by boards or curtains from the sides or from the roof beams: If there is uncleanness in the house, vessels beyond the partition remain clean. If there is uncleanness beyond the partition, vessels in the house become unclean.  With regard to the vessels beyond the partition: If there is a space of a cubic handbreadth there, they become unclean, But if not, they are clean.","3215":"In the case where it was partitioned off from the floor: If there is uncleanness beneath the partition, vessels in the house become unclean. In the case where the uncleanness is in the house, vessels beneath the partition, If there is a space there of one cubic hand breadth, remain clean; But if not, they become unclean, since the floor of the house is reckoned as the house even to the nethermost deep.","3216":"With regard to a house filled with straw, without a space of a handbreadth being left between the straw and the roof beams: If there is uncleanness within the straw, vessels at the exit become unclean. In the case where the uncleanness was outside the area of the straw, with regard to the vessels within: If they are in a space of a cubic handbreadth, they remain clean, But if not they become unclean. If there is a space of a handbreadth between the straw and the roof beams, in either case the vessels become unclean.","3217":"With regard to a house filled with earth or pebbles which he decided to leave there, or similarly a heap of produce or a mound of pebbles even such as Akhan's mound, and even if the uncleanness is by the side of the vessels, the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards.","3218":"With regard to the courtyard of a tomb: A person standing in it remains clean as long as there is a space of four cubits square, according to the words of Bet Shammai. Bet Hillel says: four handbreadths. With regard to a roof beam which had been used as a covering stone for a tomb, whether it is standing upright or lying on its side, nothing becomes unclean except what touches opposite the opening of the grave. If the end of the beam were made the covering stone of a grave, only that part up to four handbreadths from the grave becomes unclean. This applies when the beam is going to be cut. Rabbi Judah says: all the beam is connected.","3219":"A jar full of clean liquid and sealed with a tightly fitting lid,  which had been made the covering stone of a tomb, a person touching it contracts seven-day uncleanness but the jar and the liquid remain clean. An animal that had been used as a covering stone, a person touching it contracts seven-day uncleanness. Rabbi Meir says: anything possessing the breath of life does convey uncleanness on account of its being used as a covering stone.","3220":"One who touches a corpse and touches vessels, one who overshadows a corpse and touches vessels, they the vessels are unclean. One who overshadows a corpse and overshadows vessels, one who touches a corpse and overshadows vessels, they the vessels are clean. If his hands are a handbreadth wide, they are unclean. Two houses, and in each there is a half an olive's worth of corpse and he puts one hand into each house: If his hands are a handbreadth wide, he brings uncleanness; But if not, he does not bring uncleanness.","3221":"All movable things convey uncleanness when they are of the thickness of an ox-goad. Rabbi Tarfon said: May I see the demise of my sons if this is not a demised halakhah  which someone heard and misunderstood. For a farmer was passing by and over his shoulder was an ox-goad, and one end overshadowed a grave. He was declared unclean on account of vessels that were overshadowing a corpse. Rabbi Akiva said: I can fix the halakhah so that the words of the sages can exist as they are: All movable things convey uncleanness to come upon a person carrying them, when they are of the thickness of an ox-goad; Upon themselves when they are of whatever thickness; And upon other men or vessels which they overshadow when they are one handbreadth wide.","3222":"How so? A spindle stuck into the wall, with a portion of corpse of half an olive-size above it and a portion of corpse of half an olive-size below it. Even though one portion is not directly above the other, the spindle becomes unclean. Hence it is found that a movable object conveys uncleanness to come upon itself whatever its thickness. A pot seller passes by a grave with a yoke over his shoulder, one end of which overshadows a grave, vessels on the other side remain clean. If the yoke is one handbreadth wide, they become unclean. Mounds which are near to a city or to a road, whether they are new or old, are unclean. As for those that are far away, new ones are clean but old ones are unclean. What counts as near? Fifty cubits. And old? Sixty years old, the words of Rabbi Meir. R. Judah says: Near means there is none nearer than it, and old means that no one remembers when it was made.","3223":"If one finds a corpse unexpectedly lying in its natural position, he may remove it along with the blood- saturated earth around it. If he finds two, he may remove them along with the blood- saturated earth around it. If he finds three, if there is a space of from four to eight cubits between the first and the last, that is, the space of a bier and its bearers, then it must be accounted a graveyard. He must search the ground for twenty cubits from that point. If he found another corpse at the end of those twenty cubits, he must search for a further twenty cubits from that place, since there are already grounds for belief   that this is a graveyard, in spite of the fact that if he had found this lone grave in the first case, he could have removed it with the blood- saturated earth around it.","3224":"One who searches, must search over a square cubit and then leave a cubit, digging down until he reaches rock or virgin soil. A priest carrying out earth from a place of uncleanness may eat his terumah mixed with hullin. But one who is clearing away a heap of stones, may not eat his terumah mixed with hullin.","3225":"If he was searching and came to a river bed, or a pool or a public road, he may end his search. A field in which men have been slain, he may gather the bones one by one, and all the area may be accounted clean. One who removes a grave from his field, he may gather the bones one by one, and all the area may be accounted clean. A pit into which they throw fetuses or people that had been slain, he may gather the bones one by one, and all the area may be accounted clean. Rabbi Shimon says: if it had been prepared as a grave in the first place, there is blood- saturated earth.","3226":"One who plows a grave into a field, behold he makes it a bet haperas. To what extent does he make it a bet haperas? For the length of a furrow of a hundred cubits, a space in which four se'ahs can grow. Rabbi Yose says: an area of five se'ahs. But when on an upward or downward slope: he puts a quarter of a kav of vetch seed on the knee of the plough, and the space where the last three vetches grow next to each other is a bet peras. Rabbi Yose says: a bet haperas is only made by a plough going downwards but not upwards.","3227":"If a person was plowing and struck against a rock or a fence, or if he shook the plowshare, he only makes a bet peras up until that spot. Rabbi Eliezer says: one bet peras can form another bet peras. Rabbi Joshua says: sometimes it can, but at other times it cannot. How so? If he plowed for half a furrow's length and then returned and plowed a further half, or similarly if he plowed to the side, he makes a bet peras. If he plowed a full furrow's length and then returned and plowed from that point beyond, he does not make this a bet peras.","3228":"If a person plows from a pit full of bones, or from a heap of bones, Or from a field in which a grave had been lost, Or in which a grave was subsequently found, Or if he plows a field which was not his own, Or if a non-Jew plowed, he does not make a bet peras. For the rule of bet peras does not apply even to Samaritans.","3229":"In the case where there was a bet peras above a pure field, if rain washed down soil from the bet peras to the pure field, even where this was reddish and the other soil turned it white, or where this was white and the other turned it red, this does not make it a bet peras.","3230":"With regard to a field in which a grave had been lost, and upon which a house had been built with an upper story above it: If the entrance of the upper room was directly above the entrance of the house, the upper story remains clean; But if not the upper story becomes unclean. With regard to soil from a bet peras, or soil from a foreign country that came in with vegetables, the pieces of the soil combine together to transmit impurity if they form a portion the size of a packing-bag seal, the words of Rabbi Eliezer; But the sages say: there must be one portion of the size of a packing-bag seal. Rabbi Judah says: It happened once that letters came from overseas for the sons of the high priests and they had on them about a se'ah or two se'ahs of seals of dirt,   but the sages were not concerned on account of uncleanness.","3231":"How does one harvest the grapes of a bet peras? They sprinkle hatat water on the harvesters and the vessels once and then a second time. Then they harvest the grapes and take them out of the bet peras. Others then receive the grapes and take them to the winepress. If the latter set of persons came into contact with the former, they become unclean, This is according to the words of Bet Hillel. Bet Shammai say: the gatherer holds the sickle with sinew-rope, or harvests the grapes with a sharp flint, lets the grapes fall into a basket, and then he takes them to the winepress. Rabbi Yose said: When do these rules apply? Only in the case of a vineyard which subsequently became a bet peras; but a person who plants vines in a bet peras must sell the grapes in the market.","3232":"There are three kinds of bet peras: A field in which a grave was plowed may be planted with any kind of plant, But must not be sown with any kind of seed, except with seed yielding produce which is reaped. If such produce were plucked, the threshing-floor must be piled up in the field itself, and the grain sifted through two sieves, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: grain must be sifted through two sieves, but pulse through three sieves. And he must burn the stubble and the stalks. Such a field conveys uncleanness by contact and carriage but does not convey uncleanness by overshadowing.","3233":"A field in which a grave has been lost may be sown with any kind of seed, But must not be planted with any kind of plant; Nor may any trees be permitted to remain there except shade-trees which do not produce fruit. Such a field conveys uncleanness by contact, carriage and overshadowing.","3234":"A kokhin field may neither be planted nor sown, but its earth is regarded as clean and ovens may be made of it for holy use. Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel agree that it a bet peras in which a grave was plowed over is examined  for one who wished to perform the pesah sacrifice,but is not examined for one who wants to eat terumah. And as for a nazirite: Bet Shammai say: it is examined, But Bet Hillel say: it is not examined. How does he examine it? He brings earth that he can move, and places it into a sieve with fine meshes, and crumbles. If a bone of barley-corn size is found there the person passing through the field is deemed unclean.","3235":"How is a bet haperas purified? They remove soil to a depth of three handbreadths, or soil to a height of three handbreadths is placed upon it. If they removed soil from a depth of three handbreadths from one half and upon the other half they placed three hand breadths of soil, it becomes clean. Rabbi Shimon says: even they removed one handbreadth and a half and placed upon it one handbreadth and a half from another place, it becomes clean. One who paves a bet peras with stones that cannot easily be moved, it becomes clean. Rabbi Shimon says: even if one digs up the soil of a bet peras and doesn\u2019t find any bones it becomes clean.","3236":"A person who walks through a bet peras on stones that cannot easily be moved, or who rides on a man or beast whose strength is great, remains clean. But if he walks on stones that can easily be moved, or rides upon a man or beast whose strength is lousy, he becomes unclean. A person who travels in the land of the gentiles over mountains or rocks, becomes unclean; But if he travels by the sea or along the strand, he remains clean. What is meant by \u2018the strand\u2019? Any place to which the sea rises when it is stormy.","3237":"If one buys a field in Syria near to the land of Israel: If he can enter it in cleanness, it is deemed clean and is subject to the laws of tithes and sheviit produce; But he cannot enter it in cleanness, it is deemed unclean, but it is still subject to the laws of tithes and sheviit produce. The dwelling-places of non-Jews are unclean. How long must the non-Jew have dwelt in the dwelling-places for them to require examination? Forty days, even if there was no woman with him. If, however, a slave or an Israelite woman watched over the dwelling-place, it does not require examination.","3238":"What do they examine? Deep drains and foul-smelling waters. Bet Shammai say: even garbage dumps and crumbled earth. Bet Hillel say: any place where a pig or a weasel can go requires no examination.","3239":"Colonnades  are not subject to the laws of non-Jewish dwelling places. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: a non-Jewish city that has been destroyed is not subject to the laws of non-Jewish dwelling-places. The east side of Caesaron and the west side of Caesaron are graveyards. The east side of Acre was doubtful, but the sages declared it clean. Rabbi and his law court voted to decide about Keni and declared it clean.","3240":"Ten places are not subject to the laws of non-Jewish dwelling-places:Arabs\u2019 tents, Field-huts (sukkot), Triangular field-huts, Fruit-shelters, Summer shelters, A gate-house, The open spaces of a courtyard, A bath-house, An armory, And the place where the legions camp.","3241":"That which serves as a handle but does not protect, both contracts uncleanness and conveys uncleanness; but it is not included. If it protects but is not a handle, it contracts and conveys uncleanness and is included. If it neither protects nor serves as a handle, it neither contracts nor conveys uncleanness.","3242":"Roots of garlic, onions or leeks that are still moist, or their top-parts, whether they are moist or dry, also the central stalk that is within the edible part, the roots of lettuce, the radish and the turnip, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: only the large roots of the radish are included, but its fibrous roots are not included. The roots of the mint, rue, wild herbs and garden herbs that have been uprooted in order to be planted elsewhere, and the spine of an ear of grain, and its husk. Rabbi Elazar says: also the earth covering of roots; All these things contract and convey impurity and are included.","3243":"The following are both defiled and defile, but do not join together together with the rest: Roots of garlic, onions or leeks when they are dry, the stalk that is not within the edible part, the twig of a vine a handbreadth long on either side, the stem of the cluster whatsoever be its length, the tail of the cluster bereft of grapes, the stem of the \u2018broom\u2019 of the palm-tree to a length of four handbreadths, the stalk of the ear of grain to a length of three handbreadths, and the stalk of all things that are cut, to the length of three handbreadths. In the case of those things not usually cut, their stalks and roots of any size whatsoever. As for the outer husks of grains, they defile and are defiled, but do not join together.","3244":"The following neither defile nor can they be defiled and they do not join together: The roots of cabbage-stalks, Young shoots of beet growing out of the root, and similar such turnip-heads, And produce whose roots that are ordinarily cut off but in this case were pulled up with their roots. Rabbi Yose declares them all susceptible to contract uncleanness, but he declares insusceptible cabbage-stalks and turnip-heads.","3245":"Stalks of all foods that have been threshed on the threshing-floor are clean. Rabbi Yose declares them unclean. A sprig of a vine when stripped of its grapes is clean, but if one grape alone is left on it, it is unclean. A twig of a date-tree stripped of its dates is clean, but if one date remains on it, it is unclean. Similarly, with beans, if the pods were stripped from the stem it is clean, but if even one pod alone remains, it is unclean. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah declares the stalk of the broad bean clean, but declares unclean the stalk of other beans, since it is of use when the pulse is handled.","3246":"Stems of figs and dried figs, kelusim, and carobs are both defiled and defile, and they join together. Rabbi Yose says: also the stalks of the gourd. The stems of pears and krutumelin pears, quinces, and crab-apples, the stalks of the gourd and the artichoke to the length of one handbreadth. Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says: two handbreadths; All these are defiled and defile; but do not join together. As for other stems, they are neither defiled nor do they defile.","3247":"Leaves of olives pickled together with the olives remain clean, for their pickling was only for the sake of appearances. The fibrous substance on a zucchini and the flower-like substance on it are clean. Rabbi Judah says: that as long as it is still before the merchant, it is unclean.","3248":"All kinds of pits can be defiled and defile but do not join together. The pits of fresh dates, even when detached from the edible part, do join together; but those of dried dates do not join together. Accordingly, the stems of dried dates do join together, but that of fresh dates do not join together. If only part of a pit is detached, then only that part near the edible portion joins together. Similarly with a bone on which there is flesh, only that part that is close to the edible part joins together. If a bone has flesh only upon one of its sides: Rabbi Ishmael says: we take it as though the flesh encompasses it like a ring; But the sages say: only that part close to the edible part is included as is the case for example with savory, hyssop and thyme.","3249":"If a pomegranate or melon has rotted in part, what is rotten does not join together. And if the fruit is sound at either end but has rotted in the middle, what is rotten does not join together. The stem of a pomegranate does join together, but the fibrous substance in it does not join together. Rabbi Elazar says: also the comb is not susceptible to uncleanness.","3250":"All kinds of peels defile and are defiled, and join together. Rabbi Judah says: an onion has three skins: the innermost one whether it is in its entire state or whether it be pierced with holes joins together; the middle one when it is in a whole state joins together, but when it is pierced with holes does not join together; the outermost skin is in either case insusceptible to uncleanness.","3251":"If one chops up fruit for cooking, even if the chopping had not been completely finished, it is not regarded as connected. If his intention had been to pickle or to boil it, or to set it on the table, then it is regarded as connected. If he began to take the pieces apart, only that part of the food which he began to take apart is not considered connected. Nuts that had been strung together, or onions that had been piled together, count as connected. If he began to take the nuts apart, or to strip the onions, they are not connected. Shells of nuts and almonds are considered connected with the edible part until they are crushed.","3252":"The shell of a roasted egg is considered connected until it is cracked. That of a hard-boiled egg is considered connected until it is entirely broken up. A marrow-bone serves as connected until it is wholly crushed. A pomegranate that has been divided into sections is connected until it has been knocked with a stick. Similarly, loose stitches of laundrymen or a garment that had been stitched together with threads of kilayim, are connected until one begins to loosen them.","3253":"The outer leaves of vegetables: if they are green they join together, but if they have whitened they not join together. Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says: the white leaves of cabbage join together because they are edible. So also those of lettuces, because they preserve the edible part.","3254":"Onion leaves or the offshoots of onions, if there is moisture in them they are to be measured as they are; if there is empty space within them, it must be squeezed tightly together. Spongy bread is measured as it is, but if there is empty space within it, it must be pressed firmly. The flesh of a calf which had swollen, or the flesh of an old beast that has shrunken in size, are measured in the condition they are in.","3255":"A cucumber planted in a pot which grew until it was out of the pot is pure. Rabbi Shimon said: what is its nature to make it clean? Rather, that which has already become unclean remains unclean, and only that which is pure can be eaten.","3256":"Vessels made of cattle dung or of earth through which the roots can penetrate, do not render the seeds susceptible. A perforated plant-pot does not render seeds susceptible; but if it has no hole, the seeds do become susceptible. What should be the hole's dimension? Such that a small root can push its way through. If it was filled with earth to its brim, it is deemed as a frame without an edge.","3257":"Some things need to be rendered susceptible to uncleanness but they do not need intention, Other things need intention and to be rendered susceptible. Other things need intention, but do not need to be rendered susceptible, And other things need neither to be rendered susceptible nor intention. Any food that is meant for people need to be rendered susceptible, but does not need intention.","3258":"That which has been severed from a human, beast, wild animal, bird, or from the carrion of an unclean bird, and the fat in villages. And all kinds of wild vegetables, except for truffles and mushrooms; Rabbi Judah says, except for field-leeks, purslane and ornithagolum. And Rabbi Shimon says: except for cynara sycaria. Rabbi Yose says: except for muscari comusum. Behold all these need both intention and to be rendered susceptible to uncleanness.","3259":"The carrion of an unclean beast at all places, and of a clean bird in villages, need intention but do not need to be rendered susceptible. The carrion of a clean beast in all places, and that of a clean bird and also fat in the market places, require neither intention nor to be rendered susceptible. Rabbi Shimon says: also the carrion of the camel, rabbit, hare or pig.","3260":"The aneth stalk after having given its taste to a dish is no longer subject to the laws of terumah, and also no longer imparts food uncleanness. The young sprouts of hawthorn, of lapidum, or leaves of the wild arum, do not impart food uncleanness until they are sweetened. Rabbi Shimon says: also the leaves of the colocynth are like them.","3261":"Costus, amomum, principal spices, roots of crowfoot, asafoetida, pepper and lozenges made of saffron may be bought with tithe money, but they do not convey food uncleanness, the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri to him: if they may be bought with second tithe money, then why should they not impart food uncleanness? And if they do not impart food uncleanness, then they should also not be bought with second tithe money?","3262":"Unripe figs or grapes: Rabbi Akiva says: they convey food uncleanness; Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: this is only when they have reached the season when they are liable to tithes. Olives and grapes that have hardened: Bet Shammai says: they are susceptible to uncleanness, Bet Hillel says: they are insusceptible. Black cumin: Bet Shammai says: is not susceptible, Bet Hillel says: it is susceptible. Similarly they dispute with regard to their liability to tithes.","3263":"The heart of a palm is like wood in every respect, except that it may be bought for second tithe money. Unripened dates are considered food, but are exempt from tithes.","3264":"When do fish become susceptible to uncleanness? Bet Shammai say: after they have been caught. Bet Hillel say: only after they are dead. Rabbi Akiva says: if they can still live. If a branch of a fig tree was broken off, but it was still attached by its bark: Rabbi Judah says: the fruit is still not susceptible to uncleanness. But the sages say: it all depends whether they could still live. Grain that had been uprooted, but is still attached to the soil even by the smallest of roots, is not susceptible to uncleanness.","3265":"The fat of the carcass of a clean beast is not regarded as unclean with carrion uncleanness; for this reason it must first be made susceptible. The fat of an unclean beast, however, is regarded as unclean with carrion uncleanness; for this reason it need not be made at first susceptible. As for unclean fish and unclean locusts, intention is required in villages.","3266":"A bee-hive: Rabbi Eliezer says: it is treated as if it were land; and one can write a prozbul on it security, it is also not susceptible to uncleanness as long as it remains in its own place, and the one who scrapes honey from it on Shabbat is liable to a sin-offering. But the sages say: it is not to be treated as if it were land, and one many not write a prozbul on its security; it is susceptible even if it remains in its own place; and the one who scrapes honey from it on Shabbat is exempt from a sin-offering.","3267":"When do honeycombs become susceptible to uncleanness on account of their being regarded as liquids? Bet Shammai says: from the moment he begins to smoke the bees out. But Bet Hillel says: once he breaks up the honeycomb.","3268":"Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: In the world to come the Holy One, Blessed be He, will make each righteous person inherit three hundred and ten worlds, for it is written: \"That I may cause those that love me to inherit yesh (numerical value of; and that I may fill their treasuries\" (Proverbs 8:21. Rabbi Shimon ben Halafta said: the Holy One, Blessed be He, found no vessel that could contain blessing for Israel save that of peace, as it is written: \"The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace\" (Psalms 29:11).","3269":"Rabbi Eliezer says: the heifer is no more than one year old and the cow no more than two years old. But the sages ruled: the heifer may be even two years old and the red cow even three or four years old. Rabbi Meir says: even five years old, though she is old. But they did not wait with it so long since it might in the meantime grow some black hairs and thus become invalid. Rabbi Joshua said: I only heard of a cow that was three years old shelashit. They said to him: What does \"shelashit\" mean? He replied: thus have I heard it without any explanation. Ben Azzai said: I will explain: if you say \"shelishit\" the meaning is \u2018the third\u2019 in number to others, but when you say \"shelashit\" the meaning is one that is three years old. Similarly they said a vineyard that is \"revai.\" They said to him: what does \"revai\" mean? He replied: thus have I heard it without any explanation. Ben Azzai said: I will explain: if you say \"revii\" the meaning is the fourth in number to others, but when you say \"revai\" the meaning is one that is four years old. Similarly it was ruled: if a man ate in an afflicted house half a loaf, three of which can be made from a kav, he becomes unclean. They said to him: say rather \"eighteen of which are made of a se'ah.\" He replied: thus have I heard it without any explanation. Ben Azzai said: I will explain: when you say, three of which are made of a kav it would not contain hallah, but if you say, eighteen of which are made of a se'ah, it has been reduced by its hallah.","3270":"Rabbi Yose the Galilean said: bulls must be no more than two years old, for it is said, \"And the second bull you shall take for a sin-offering\" (Numbers 8:8). But the sages say: they may be even three years old. Rabbi Meir says: even those that are four or five years old are valid, but old animals are not brought out of respect.","3271":"Lambs no more than one year old, And rams no more than two years old. And all these years are reckoned from day to day. One that is thirteen months old is not valid, neither as a ram nor as a lamb. Rabbi Tarfon called it palges. Ben Azzai called it noked. Rabbi Ishmael called it parakhrigma. If a man offered it he must bring for it the libation of a ram, but it is not counted as his offering. One that is thirteen months old behold it is a ram.","3272":"The sin-offerings of the congregation and their burnt-offerings, the sin-offering of an individual, the guilt-offering of a nazirite and the guilt-offering of a metzora are valid from the thirtieth day onwards, and also on the thirtieth day. If they were offered on the eighth day they are valid. Vow-offerings and freewill-offerings, firstlings and the tithe of cattle and the pesach are valid from the eighth day onwards, and also on the eighth day.","3273":"Rabbi Eliezer says: a red cow for the hatat that is pregnant is valid, But the sages say: it is invalid. Rabbi Eliezer says: it may not be bought from non-Jews, But the sages say: it is valid. And not only this, but all sacrifices of the congregation or the individual may be brought from the land of Israel and from outside the land, from new produce and from the old; Except the omer and the two loaves, which may be brought only from new produce and from within the land.","3274":"If the horns or the hoofs of the red cow are black they are chopped off. The eye ball, the teeth and the tongue cause do not invalidate the red cow. One that is dwarf-like is valid. If there was on it an extra digit and it was cut off: Rabbi Judah says that it is invalid. Rabbi Shimon says: wherever, if removed, no red hair grows in its place is it invalid.","3275":"One that is born from the side, the hire of a harlot or the price of a dog is invalid. Rabbi Eliezer says that it is valid, as it says, \"You shall not bring the hire of a harlot or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord your God,\" and this was not brought into the house. All blemishes that cause consecrated animals to be invalid cause also the red cow to be invalid. If one had ridden on it, leaned on it, hung on its tail, crossed a river by its help, doubled up its leading rope, or put one's cloak on it, it is invalid. But if one had only tied it up by its leading rope or made for it a sandal to prevent it from slipping or spread one's cloak on it because of flies, it is valid. This is the general rule: wherever anything is done for its own sake, it remains valid; but if for the sake of another, it becomes invalid.","3276":"If a bird rested on it, it remains valid. If a male beast mounted it, it becomes invalid. Rabbi Judah says: if the male was made to mount, it becomes invalid; but if it did so of itself, it remains valid.","3277":"If it had two black or white hairs growing within one follicle, it is invalid. Rabbi Judah said: within one kos; if they grew within two kosot that were adjacent to one another, it is invalid. Rabbi Akiva says: even if there were four or five but they were dispersed, they may be plucked out. Rabbi Eliezer says: even as many as fifty. Rabbi Joshua ben Batera says: even if it had but one on its head and one on its tail, it is invalid. If it had two hairs with their roots black and their tips red or with their roots red and their tips black, everything goes according to what is visible, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: by the root.","3278":"Seven days before the burning of the red cow they would separate the priest who was to burn the cow from his house to a chamber that was facing the north-eastern corner of the birah, and which was called the Stone Chamber. They would sprinkle upon him throughout the seven days with a mixture of all the sin-offerings that were there. Rabbi Yose said: they sprinkled upon him only on the third and the seventh days. Rabbi Hanina the vice-chief of the priests said: on the priest that was to burn the cow they sprinkled all the seven days, but on the one that was to perform the service on Yom Kippur they sprinkled on the third and the seventh days only.","3279":"Courtyards were built in Jerusalem over rock, and beneath them there was a hollow which served as a protection against a grave in the depths. And they used to bring there pregnant women, and there they gave birth to their children and there they raised them. And they brought oxen, upon whose backs were placed doors, and the children sat upon them with stone cups in their hands. When they reached the Shiloah spring they got down and filled the cups with water and then they ascended and sat again on the doors. Rabbi Yose said: each child used to let down his cup and fill it from his place.","3280":"They arrived at the Temple Mount and got down. Beneath the Temple Mount and the courts was a hollow which served as a protection against a grave in the depths. And at the entrance of the courtyard there was the jar of the ashes of the sin-offerings. They would bring a male from among the sheep and tie a rope between its horns, and a stick or a bushy twig was tied at the other end of the rope, and this was thrown into the jar. They then struck the male sheep was so that it started backwards. And a child took the ashes and put it enough so that it could be seen upon the water. Rabbi Yose said: do not give the Sadducees an opportunity to rule! Rather, a child himself took it and mixed it.","3281":"One may not bring a sin-offering by virtue of the purifications made for another sin-offering, nor one child by virtue of the preparations made for another. The children had to be sprinkle on each other, the words of Rabbi Yose the Galilean. Rabbi Akiva says: they did not need to sprinkle.","3282":"If they did not find the residue of the ashes of the seven red cows they performed the sprinkling with those of six, of five, of four, of three, of two or of one. And who prepared these? Moses prepared the first, Ezra prepared the second, and five were prepared from the time of Ezra, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: seven from the time of Ezra. And who prepared them? Shimon the Just and Yohanan the high priest prepared two; Elihoenai the son of Ha-Kof and Hanamel the Egyptian and Ishmael the son of Piabi prepared one each.","3283":"They made a ramp from the Temple Mount to the Mount of Olives, being constructed of arches above arches, each arch placed directly above each foundation of the arch below as a protection against a grave in the depths, whereby the priest who was to burn the cow, the cow itself and all who aided in its preparation went forth to the Mount of olives.","3284":"If the cow refused to go out, they may not take out with it a black one lest people say, \"They slaughtered a black cow\" nor another red cow lest people say, \"They slaughtered two.\" Rabbi Yose says: it was not for this reason but because it is said \"And he shall bring her out\" by herself. The elders of Israel used to go first by foot to the Mount of Olives, where there was a place of immersion. The priest that was to burn the cow was made unclean on account of the Sadducees so that they should not be able to say, \"It can be done only by those on whom the sun has set.\"","3285":"They laid their hands upon him and said, \"My Lord the high priest, perform immersion once.\" He went down and immersed himself and came up and dried himself. Different kinds of wood were set in order there: cedar wood, pine, spruce and the wood of smooth fig trees. They made it in the shape of a tower and opened air holes in it; and its foreside was turned towards the west.","3286":"They bound it with a rope of reed and placed it on the pile with its head towards the south and its face towards the west. The priest stood in the east with his face towards the west. He slaughtered with his right hand and received the blood with his left. Rabbi Judah said: he received the blood with his right hand and put it in his left hand. He sprinkled with his right. Seven times he dipped his finger in the blood and sprinkled it towards the Holy of Holies, dipping once again for each sprinkling. When he finished the sprinkling he wiped his hand on the body of the cow, came down and kindled the fire with wood chips. Rabbi Akiva said: with dry branches of palm-trees.","3287":"It burst and he stood outside its pit and he took the cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool. He said to them, \"Is this cedarwood? Is this cedarwood?\" \"Is this hyssop? Is this hyssop?\" \"Is this scarlet wool? Is this scarlet wool?\" Three times he repeated each question and they answered him \"Yes, yes\"   three times to each question.","3288":"He then wrapped them together with the remains of the strip of wool and cast them into the fire. When it was burnt up they would beat it with sticks and then sift it with sieves. Rabbi Ishmael says: this was done with stone hammers and stone sieves. If there was a black coal on which there were some ashes they would crush it but if there were no ashes they would leave it. A bone was crushed in either case. It was then divided into three parts: one part was deposited on the hel, one on the Mount of Olives, and one was divided among the priestly watches.","3289":"If a hatat cow was slaughtered not for its own name, or if its blood was received or sprinkled not for its own name, or if this was done for its own name and for some other name, or for some other name and for its name, it is invalid. Rabbi Eliezer rules it valid. If the service was performed by one whose hands or feet were unwashed, it is invalid. Rabbi Eliezer rules that it is valid. If it was performed by one who was not the high priest, it is invalid. Rabbi Judah rules that it is valid. If it was performed by one who was not wearing all the prescribed garments, it is invalid. And in white garments it was to be prepared.","3290":"If it was burnt outside its pit, or in two pits, or if two cows were burnt in the same pit, it is invalid. If the blood was sprinkled but not in the direction of the entrance of the Holy of Holies, it is invalid. If he made the seventh sprinkling out of the sixth and then sprinkled again a seventh time, it is invalid. If he sprinkled an eighth time out of the seventh and then sprinkled again an eighth time, it is valid.","3291":"If he burned it without wood, or with any kind of wood, and even if only with straw or stubble, it is valid. If he flayed it and cut up, it is valid. If he slaughtered it with the intention of eating its flesh or drinking its blood, it is valid. Rabbi Eliezer rules: no intention can invalidate the red cow.","3292":"All who are occupied with the preparation of the red cow from the beginning until the end, defile their clothing, and they also render it invalid by doing other work. If some invalidity occurred while it was being slaughtered, it does not defile clothing. If it occurred while the blood was being sprinkled, for all who were occupied with it before the invalidity occurred, it defiles their clothing, but for those who were occupied with it after it had become invalid it does not defile their clothing unclean. Thus it follows that the stringency turns into a leniency. It is always subject to the rules of trespassing. Wood may be added to the fire. The service must be performed by day and by a priest. Work renders it invalid. All of this is only until it becomes ashes And work causes the water to be invalid until the ashes are put into it.","3293":"He who brings the earthen vessel for the hatat must immerse, and spend the night by the furnace. Rabbi Judah says: he may also bring it from the house and it is valid, for all are deemed trustworthy in regard to the hatat. In the case of terumah one may open the furnace and take out the vessel. Rabbi Shimon says: from the second row. Rabbi Yose says: from the third row.","3294":"If one immersed a vessel for the hatat in water that is not fit for the mixing he must dry it; If in water that is fit for the mixing he need not dry it. But if he intended to collect in it water that was already mixed with the ashes, he must dry it in either case.","3295":"If a pumpkin shell was immersed in water that was not fit for the mixing, it is permissible to mix in it the ashes with the water, as long as it had not been defiled. If it has been defiled, one cannot mix in it the ashes with the water. Rabbi Joshua says: if one is allowed to mix in it the ashes and water at the beginning, one should also be allowed to do so at the end; and if one is not allowed to do this at the end one should not be allowed to do it at the beginning. In either case it is not permissible to collect in it water that has already had ashes mixed in.","3296":"A reed pipe that was cut for use as a container for the hatat: Rabbi Eliezer says: it must be immersed immediately. Rabbi Joshua ruled: he defiles it and then immerses it. All are eligible to prepare the mixture, except a deaf mute, an imbecile and a minor. Rabbi Judah says a minor is eligible, but disqualifies a woman and a hermaphrodite.","3297":"They can make the mixture in all kinds of vessels, even in vessels made of cattle dung, of stone or of earth. The mixture may also be prepared in a boat. It may not be prepared in the walls of vessels, or in the sides of a large jug, or in the stopper of a jar, or in one's cupped hands, for one does not fill up, or mix in, or sprinkle the hatat with anything but a vessel. Only on a vessel does tightly fitting cover afford protection, for only in vessels is protection afforded against uncleanness within an earthen vessel.","3298":"A potters\u2019 egg is fit as a vessel. Rabbi Yose rules that it is unfit. A hen's egg: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Judah rule it is fit as a vessel; But the sages rule that it is unfit.","3299":"It is not permissible to collect the water in a trough set in the stone, nor is it permissible to prepare the mixture in it, nor may the sprinkling be done from it, nor does it require a tightly fitting cover, nor does it render a ritual bath invalid. If it was first a movable vessel and then was subsequently joined to the ground with lime, it is permissible to collect the water in it, to prepare the mixture in it and to sprinkle from it. And it needs a tightly fitting cover and renders a ritual bath invalid. If there was a hole in it below, and he stopped it up with a rag, the water in it is invalid since it is not wholly enclosed by the vessel. If the hole was in the side and it was stopped up with a rag, the water in it is valid since it is wholly enclosed by the vessel. If he made a rim of clay for the vessel and the water had risen to that spot, it is invalid; But if it was solid enough for the vessel to be moved with it, the water is valid.","3300":"If there were two troughs in one stone and the mixture was prepared in one of them, the water in the other is not prepared. If a hole of the size of the spout of a water skin passed from one to the other, or if the water overflowed both, even if only to a depth of the thickness of garlic peel, and the mixture was prepared in one of them, the water in the other is also prepared.","3301":"If one placed two stones close to one another and made them into a trough, and so also in the case of two kneading troughs, and so also in the case of a trough that was split, the water between them is not deemed to be prepared. If they were joined together with lime or gypsum and they can be moved together, the water between them is deemed to have been prepared.","3302":"If one was about to mix the ashes with the water and the ashes fell upon his hand or upon the side of the trough and then fell into the trough, the mixture is invalid. If they fell from the tube into the trough, the mixture is invalid. If he took the ashes from the tube and then covered it, or shut a door, the ashes remain valid but the water becomes invalid. If he put it up erect on the ground, the water becomes invalid. If in his hand, the water is valid, since it is impossible otherwise","3303":"If the ashes floated on the water: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon rule: one may take some of them and use them in another preparation; But the sages say: with any ashes that have touched water no other mixture may be prepared from them. If he emptied out the water and some ashes were found at the bottom: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon rule: one may dry them and then use them for another preparation; But the sages rule: with any ashes that have touched water no other mixture may be prepared.","3304":"One who mixes the water in a trough while a bucket was in it, even though its neck was narrow as can be, the waters in it are prepared. If there was a sponge in the trough, the water in it is invalid. What should he do? He should empty out the water until he gets to the sponge. If one touched the sponge, however much the water that washes over it, the water becomes invalid.","3305":"If he placed his hand or his foot or leaves of vegetables in such a manner as to enable the water to run into a jar, the water is invalid. If he used leaves of reeds or leaves of nuts the water is valid. This is the general rule: water passing over that which is susceptible to uncleanness is invalid, but water passing over that which is not susceptible to uncleanness is valid.","3306":"One who diverts a spring into a wine vat or into pools, the water is invalid for zavim and metzoraim. And also for the preparation of the hatat water. Because it was not drawn into a vessel.","3307":"If five men filled five jars to prepare with them five mixtures, and then they changed their minds to prepare one mixture from all of them, or if they filled the jars to prepare with them one mixture and then they changed their minds to prepare with them five mixtures, all the water remains valid. If one man filled five jars intending to prepare five separate mixtures, even though he changed his mind to prepare one mixture from all of them, only the last is valid. If he intended to prepare one mixture from all of them and then he changed his mind to prepare five separate mixtures, only the water in the one that was mixed first is valid. If he said to another man, \"Prepare mixtures from these for yourself,\" only the first is valid; But if he said, \"Prepare a mixture from these for me,\" all are valid.","3308":"One who filled the water with one hand and did some other work with the other hand, or filled the water for himself and for another man, or filled two jars at the same time, the water of both is invalid, for work causes invalidity whether one acts for oneself or for another person.","3309":"One who prepared the mixture with one hand and did some other work with the other hand, the mixture is invalid if he prepared it for himself, but if he prepared it for another man, it is valid. If he prepared a mixture both for himself and for another man, his is invalid and that of the other man is valid. If he prepares mixtures for two men simultaneously, both are valid.","3310":"If one said to another \"Prepare the mixture for me and I will prepare the one for you,\" the first is valid. If he said, \"Fill the water for me and I will fill the water for you,\" that of the latter is valid. If he said, \"Prepare the mixture for me and I will draw the water for you,\" both mixtures are valid. If he said, \"Fill the water for me and I will prepare the mixture for you\u2019, both mixtures are invalid.","3311":"One who is drawing water for his own use and for the mixture of the hatat, he must draw for himself first and fasten the bucket to the carrying pole and then he can draw the water for the hatat. If he drew first the water for the hatat and then he drew the water for himself, it is invalid. He must put his own behind him and that for the hatat before him, and if he put that for the hatat behind him it is invalid. If both were for the hatat, he may put one before him and one behind him and both are valid, since it is impossible to do otherwise.","3312":"One who carries the rope in his hand, If in his usual manner, the mixture is valid; But if not in his usual manner, it is invalid. The question was sent on to Yavneh on three festivals and on the third festival, it was ruled that the mixture was valid, as a temporary measure.","3313":"If a man coils the rope around his hand little by little, the mixture is valid; But if he coiled it afterwards, it is invalid. Rabbi Yose said: this also had been ruled to be valid as a temporary measure.","3314":"One who puts the jar away in order that it shall not be broken, or if he inverted it in order to dry it, If he did one of these things so that he might draw more water with it, the water he had already drawn is valid; But if he intended to carry in it the ashes, it is invalid. One who cleared potsherds from a trough: If in order that it may hold more water, the water is valid; But if he intended that they should not hinder him when he pours out the water, it is invalid.","3315":"One was carrying his water on his shoulder and he ruled in a matter of law, or showed others the way, or killed a snake or a scorpion, or picked up food in order to store it, it the water is invalid; But if he picked up food to eat, it is valid. And if he killed a snake or a scorpion that hindered him, it remains valid. Rabbi Judah said: this is the general rule: If the act was is in the nature of work, the mixture is invalid whether the man stopped or not, If it was not in the nature of work: If he stopped, it is invalid; But if he did not stop it remains valid.","3316":"If one gave over his water to someone who was unclean, it is invalid. But if to a clean one it is valid. Rabbi Eliezer says: even if it was entrusted to an unclean man it is valid, provided the owner did no other work in the meantime.","3317":"Two men who were drawing water for the hatat and one assisted the other to raise it or one pulled out a thorn for the other: For one mixture, it is valid; For two mixtures, it is invalid. Rabbi Yose says: even if there are to be two mixtures it is valid if they had made a mutual agreement between them.","3318":"One who broke down a fence even with the intention of putting it up again, the water remains valid; But if he put a fence up, the water becomes invalid. If he ate figs intending to store some of them, the water is valid; But if he stored figs it is invalid. If he was eating figs and, leaving some over, threw what was in his hand under the fig tree or among drying figs in order that it shall not be wasted, the water is invalid.","3319":"Two men were guarding a trough: If one of them became unclean, the water remains valid, since it is in the domain of the other. If the first became clean and the other became unclean the water is still valid since it is in the domain of the first. If both became unclean simultaneously the water becomes invalid. If one of them did some work, the water remains valid since it is in the domain of the second. If the first stopped doing work and the other did some work, the water still remains valid since it is in the domain of the first. If both did some work at the same time the water becomes invalid.","3320":"One who prepares the mixture of the hatat should not wear his sandals, for were some of the liquid to fall on his sandal it would become unclean and the sandal would defile him. Behold he would say to the sandal, \"That which defiled you did not defile me, but you did defile me.\" If some of the liquid fell on his skin he remains clean. If it fell on his garment it becomes unclean and defiles him. Behold he would say to the garment, \"That which defiled you did not defile me, but you did defile me.\"","3321":"The one who burns the red cow or bulls and he that leads away the scapegoat, defile garments. The red cow and the bulls and the scapegoat do not themselves defile garments. Behold the garment would say to the person, \"That which defiled you did not defile me, but you did defile me.","3322":"One that eats of the carrion of a clean bird, while it is yet in his throat, causes garments to be unclean; But the carrion itself does not cause garments to be unclean. Behold the garment would say to the person, \"That which defiled you did not defile me, but you did defile me.","3323":"Any derived uncleanness does not defile vessels, but it does defile a liquid. If a liquid became unclean it defiles them. Behold the vessel would say to the liquid, \"That which defiled you did not defile me, but you did defile me.","3324":"An earthenware vessel does not defile another such vessel, but it does defile a liquid. And when the liquid becomes unclean it defile the vessel. Behold the vessel would say to the liquid, \"That which defiled you did not defile me, but you did defile me.\"","3325":"Whatever causes terumah to be invalid causes liquid to become unclean in the first grade so that it can convey uncleanness at one remove, and render unfit at one other remove, except for a tevul yom. Behold the food would say to the liquid, \"That which defiled you did not defile me, but you did defile me.\"","3326":"All seas are equivalent to a ritual bath of the waters He called the seas\" (Genesis 1:10), the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: only the Great Sea is equivalent to a ritual bath, for it says \"seas\" only because there are in it many kinds of seas. Rabbi Yose says: all seas afford cleanness when running, and yet they are unfit for zavim and metzoraim and for the preparation of the hatat waters.","3327":"Spoiled waters are unfit. The following are spoiled waters: those that are salty or lukewarm. Waters that disappoint are unfit. The following are waters that disappoint: those that disappoint even once in a seven year cycle. Those that disappoint only in times of war or in years of drought are fit. Rabbi Judah says: they are unfit.","3328":"The waters of the Karmiyon and the waters of Pugah are unfit, because they are marsh waters. The waters of the Jordan and the waters of the Yarmuk are unfit, because they are mixed waters. And the following are mixed waters: a fit kind and an unfit kind that were mixed together. If two kinds that are fit were mixed together both remain fit: Rabbi Judah says that they are unfit.","3329":"Ahab's well and the pool in Banias cave are fit. Water that has changed its color and the change arose from itself, remains fit. A water channel that comes from a distance is fit, as long as it is watched so that no one cuts it off. Rabbi Judah says: the presumption is that it is permitted. If some clay or earth fell into a well, one must wait until it becomes clear, the words of Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi Akiba says: he need not wait.","3330":"If the smallest amount of water fell into a flask: Rabbi Eliezer says: the sprinkling must be done twice; But the sages say that the mixture is invalid. If dew dropped into it: Rabbi Eliezer says: let it be put out in the sun and the dew will rise. But the sages say that the mixture is invalid. If a liquid or fruit juice fell into it, all the contents must be poured away and it is also necessary to dry the flask. If ink, gum or sulphate of copper, or anything that leaves a mark, fell into it, the contents must be poured away but it is not necessary to dry the flask.","3331":"If insects or creeping things fell into it, and they burst apart or the color of the water changed, the contents become invalid. A beetle causes invalidity in any case, because it is like a tube. Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob ruled: a maggot or a weevil of the grain causes no invalidity, because they contain no moisture.","3332":"If a domesticated beast or a wild animal drank from it, it becomes invalid. All birds cause invalidity, except the dove since it only sucks up the water. All creeping things do not cause invalidity, except the weasel since it laps up the water. Rabban Gamaliel ruled: the snake also because it vomits. Rabbi Eliezer ruled: the mouse also.","3333":"If one intended to drink the hatat water: Rabbi Eliezer says: it becomes invalid. Rabbi Joshua says: only when one tips the flask. Rabbi Yose said: To what does this apply? To water that had not yet been prepared, But in the case of water that had been prepared: Rabbi Eliezer says: it becomes invalid only when one tips the flask; And Rabbi Joshua says: only when one drinks. And if it was poured directly into one's throat, it remains valid.","3334":"Hatat water that became invalid, it may not be mixed into the mud since it might become a snare for others. Rabbi Judah says: it becomes neutralized. A cow that drank of the hatat water, its flesh becomes unclean for twenty-four hours. Rabbi Judah says: it becomes neutralized in its bowels.","3335":"Hatat waters and hatat ashes one may not carry them across a river on a ship, nor may one float them upon the water, nor may one stand on the bank on one side and throw them across to the other side. One may, however, cross over with the water up to his neck. He that is clean for the hatat may sail across a river carrying in his hands an empty vessel that is clean for the hatat or water that has not yet been prepared.","3336":"If valid ashes were mixed up with wood ashes, we follow the majority with regard to uncleanness, but the mixture may not be prepared with it. Rabbi Eliezer says: the mixture may be prepared with all of them.","3337":"Hatat waters that have been invalidated still defile one who is clean for terumah by contact with his hands or with his body. And one who is clean for the hatat they defile neither by contact with his hands nor by contact with his body. If they become unclean, they defile one who is clean for terumah by contact either with his hands or with his body, And one who is clean for the hatat they defile by contact with his hands but not by contact with his body.","3338":"If valid ashes were put on water that was unfit for the preparation, the latter defiles one that is clean for terumah by contact with his hands or with his body, But to one who is clean for the hatat it conveys uncleanness neither by contact with his hands nor with his body.","3339":"Any object that is susceptible to midras uncleanness is for the purpose of the hatat waters deemed to have madaf uncleanness, whether it was otherwise unclean or clean. A person too is subject to the same rule. Any object that is susceptible to corpse uncleanness, whether it is otherwise unclean or clean: Rabbi Eliezer says: it does not have madaf uncleanness. Rabbi Joshua says: it has madaf uncleanness; And the sages say: that which was unclean has madaf uncleanness, and that which was clean does not have madaf uncleanness.","3340":"One who was clean for the hatat waters who touched something that has madaf uncleannes, he becomes unclean. A flask that was designated for the hatat waters that touched something that has madaf uncleanness, it becomes unclean. One who was clean for the hatat waters who touched food or liquids with his hand, he becomes unclean, but if he did it with his foot he remains clean. If he moved them with his hand: Rabbi Joshua says that he becomes unclean, And the sages say that he remains clean.","3341":"A jar of hatat waters that touched a dead sheretz, remains clean. If the jar was put on it: Rabbi Eliezer rules that it remains clean, And the sages rule that it becomes unclean. If the jar touched foods or liquids or the Holy Scriptures, it remains clean. If it was put on them: Rabbi Yose rules that it remains clean; And the sages say that it becomes unclean.","3342":"One who was clean for the hatat waters and then touched an oven: With his hand becomes unclean, With his foot he remains clean. If he stood on an oven and put out his hand beyond the oven with the flask in his hand, And so also in the case of a carrying-yoke which was placed over the oven and from which two jars were suspended one at either end: Rabbi Akiva says that they remain clean; But the sages say that they are unclean.","3343":"If he was standing outside an oven and he stretched out his hand to a window and he took a flask and passed it over the oven: Rabbi Akiva says that it is unclean, And the sages say that it is clean. But he who was clean for the hatat waters may stand over an oven while holding in his hand an empty vessel that is clean for the hatat waters or one filled with water that has not yet been mixed with the ashes of the red cow.","3344":"A flask containing hatat waters that touched a vessel containing consecrated food or terumah: that containing the hatat waters becomes unclean, but the one containing the consecrated food or the terumah remains clean. If he held the two vessels one in each of his two hands, both become unclean. If they were both wrapped in separate papers, they remain clean. If the vessel of the hatat waters was wrapped in a paper while that of the terumah was held in his hand, both become unclean. If the one containing the terumah was wrapped up in paper while that containing the hatat waters was held in his hand, both remain clean. Rabbi Joshua says: that containing the hatat waters becomes unclean. If both were placed on the ground and he touched them, that of the hatat waters becomes unclean but that of the consecrated food or terumah remains clean. If he shifted it without touching it: Rabbi Joshua says that it is unclean, And the sages rule that it is clean.","3345":"A flask that one has left uncovered and on returning found it to be covered, is invalid. If one left it covered and on returning found it to be uncovered, it is invalid if a weasel could have drunk from it or, according to the words of Rabban Gamaliel, a snake, or if it was possible for dew to fall into it in the night. The hatat waters are not protected by a tightly fitting cover; But water that had not yet been mixed with the ashes is protected by a tightly fitting cover.","3346":"Anything that is doubtfully pure in the case of terumah is regarded as clean in the case of the hatat waters. Anything that is \"suspended\" where terumah is concerned, the hatat waters are poured out. If clean things were handled on account of it, they must be \"suspended.\" Wooden lattice work is clean in respect of holy food, terumah, and the hatat waters. Rabbi Eliezer says: Loosely connected wood is unclean in respect of hatat waters.","3347":"Pressed figs of terumah which fell into hatat waters and were taken out and eaten: If the amount is the size of an egg, whether the figs were clean or unclean the water becomes unclean, and he who eats the figs is liable for death; If their size is less than the size of an egg, the water remains clean but he who eats them is liable for death. Rabbi Yose says: if they were clean the water remains clean. If one who was clean for the hatat waters puts his head and the greater part of his body into the hatat waters, he becomes unclean.","3348":"All that require immersion in water according to the rulings of the Torah defile consecrated things, terumah, unconsecrated food, and second tithe; And he is forbidden to enter the sanctuary. After immersion but before the sun sets he defiles holy things and invalidates terumah, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages ruled: he invalidates consecrated things and terumah. But he is permitted to unconsecrated food and second tithe. And if he entered the sanctuary, whether before or after his immersion, he incurs guilt.","3349":"All that require immersion in water according to the words of the scribes defile consecrated things and invalidate terumah to be unfit, but they are permitted to unconsecrated food and second tithe, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages forbid second tithe. After immersion but before the sun sets he is permitted to all these. And if he entered the sanctuary, whether before or after his immersion, he incurs no guilt.","3350":"All that require immersion in water, whether according to the words of the Torah or according to the words of the scribes, defile hatat waters, hatat ashes, and the one who sprinkled the hatat waters, either through contact or through carrying. And they defile hyssop that has been rendered susceptible to uncleanness, and water that had not yet been prepared, and an empty vessel that is clean for the hatat through contact and carrying, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: only by contact but not by carrying.","3351":"Any hyssop that has an accompanying name is invalid. \"This\" hyssop is valid. Ezovyon hyssop, blue hyssop, Roman hyssop or wild hyssop is invalid. That of unclean terumah is invalid. That of clean terumah should not be used for sprinkling, but if one had used it for sprinkling it is valid. The sprinkling must not be done either with the young shoots or with the berries. He is not liable after the sprinkling had been done with young shoots for entering the sanctuary. Rabbi Eliezer says: also not if it was done with the berries. The following are regarded as young shoots: the stalks before the buds have ripened.","3352":"The hyssop that was used for sprinkling the hatat waters is also fit for cleansing the metzora. If it was gathered for firewood, and liquid fell upon it, it may be dried and it becomes fit. If it was gathered for food, and liquid fell upon it, even though it was dried, it is invalid. If it was gathered for the sprinkling of the waters of the hatat, it is subject to the same law as if it were gathered for food, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah, Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon ruled: as if it were gathered for firewood.","3353":"The mitzvah of the hyssop: it should have three stalks bearing three buds. Rabbi Judah says: each stalk should have three buds. Hyssop that consists of a growth of three stalks should be cut apart and then bound together. If the stalks were cut apart but were not bound together, or if they were bound together but were not cut apart, or if they were neither cut apart nor bound together, they are nevertheless valid. Rabbi Yose says: the mitzvah of the hyssop is that it should have three stalks, and on them three buds, but its remnants need only have two, while its stumps may be of the smallest size.","3354":"Hyssop that is too short may be lengthened with a thread and a spindle-reed. He then dips it and brings it up again. He grasps the hyssop itself and sprinkles with it. Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Shimon say: just as the sprinkling must be done with the hyssop itself so to must the dipping be done with the hyssop itself.","3355":"If a person sprinkled and it is doubtful whether the water came from the thread or the spindle-reed or the buds, the sprinkling is invalid. If he sprinkled upon two vessels and it is doubtful whether he sprinkled on both or whether some water from the one dripped on to the other, it is invalid. If a needle was on a piece of earthenware and one sprinkled upon it, and it is doubtful whether he sprinkled on the needle or whether some water dripped on it from the earthenware, his sprinkling is invalid. A flask with a narrow mouth, one may dip in and draw out in the usual way. Rabbi Judah says: this may be done only for the first sprinkling. Hatat waters which were diminished, one may dip only the tips of the buds and sprinkle, provided the hyssop does not absorb any of the moisture on the sides of the flask. If one intended to sprinkle in front of him and he sprinkled behind him, or behind him and he sprinkled in front of him, his sprinkling is invalid. If he intended to sprinkle in front of him and he sprinkled to the sides in front of him, his sprinkling is valid. It is permitted to sprinkle upon a person with his knowledge or without his knowledge. It is permitted to sprinkle upon a person and vessels even though there are a hundred of them.","3356":"If he intended to sprinkle upon a thing that is susceptible to uncleanness and he sprinkled upon something that is not susceptible to uncleanness, if any of the water still remained on the hyssop he should not sprinkle with it again. If he intended to sprinkle upon a thing that is not susceptible to uncleanness and he sprinkled on that which is susceptible to uncleanness, even though there was still some water on the hyssop, he can sprinkle with it again. If he intended to sprinkle upon a man and he sprinkled upon a beast, if any of the water remained on the hyssop he should not sprinkle with it again; But if he intended to sprinkle upon a beast and he sprinkled upon a man, even though there was still some water on the hyssop, he can sprinkle with it again. The water that drips off is valid, and therefore it conveys uncleanness as the usual hatat waters.","3357":"If one was sprinkling from a window in a public domain and a man who was thus sprinkled upon entered the sanctuary, and the water was found to be invalid, he is exempt; But if the sprinkling was done from a private window and a man who was thus sprinkled upon entered the sanctuary, and the water was found to be invalid, he is liable. A high priest, however, is exempt, whether the sprinkling upon him was done from a private window or from one in a public domain, for a high priest is never liable for entering the sanctuary. The people used to slip before a certain window in a public domain, and nevertheless they trod on that spot and did not refrain from entering the sanctuary, because they said that hatat waters whose mitzvah had been performed do not defile.","3358":"A clean person may hold in the corner of his garment an unclean axe and sprinkle upon it; And even though there is on it enough water for a sprinkling he remains clean. How much water is necessary for sprinkling? Sufficient for the tops of the buds to be dipped and for the sprinkling to be performed. Rabbi Judah ruled: they are regarded as though they were on a hyssop of brass.","3359":"One who sprinkles with unclean hyssop: if the hyssop was the amount of an egg the water becomes invalid, and the sprinkling is invalid. If it was less than the amount of an egg, the water remains valid but the sprinkling is invalid. It also defiles other hyssop, and that other hyssop to other, even if they be a hundred.","3360":"If the hands of a man who was clean for the hatat waters became unclean, his body also becomes unclean, and he conveys uncleanness to his fellow, and his fellow to his fellow, even if they be a hundred.","3361":"A flask for hatat waters whose outer part has become unclean, its inner part also becomes unclean, and it conveys uncleanness to another flask, and the other to another, even if they are a hundred. A bell and a clapper are regarded as connected. In the case of a spindle stick used for coarse material, one should not sprinkle on its stick or ring, but if he sprinkled on one, both are regarded as having been sprinkled upon. A spindle stick used for flax they are regarded as connected. If a leather cover of a crib is fastened to its knobs, both are regarded as connected. The base is not regarded as connected either in respect of uncleanness or cleanness. All drilled handles of utensils are regarded as connected. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: also those that are wedged into holes in the utensils.","3362":"The baskets of a pack-saddle, the bed of a barrow, the iron corner of a bier, the drinking horns of travelers, a key chain, the loose stitches of washermen, and a garment stitched together with kilayim are regarded as connected in respect of uncleanness but not in that of sprinkling.","3363":"The lid of a kettle which is joined to a chain: Bet Shammai say: these are regarded as connected in respect of uncleanness but not in respect of sprinkling. Bet Hillel say: if he sprinkled on the kettle, it is the same as if the lid also was sprinkled upon; but if he sprinkled on the lid only it is not the same as if the kettle also was sprinkled upon. All are eligible to sprinkle, except a tumtum, a hermaphrodite, a woman, and a child that is without understanding. A woman may assist a man while he sprinkles, and hold the water for him while he dips and sprinkles. If she held his hand, even if only at the time of sprinkling, it is invalid.","3364":"If he dipped the hyssop during the day and he sprinkled during the day, it is valid. If he dipped it during the day and sprinkled at night, or dipped at night and sprinkled on the following day, it is invalid. But he himself may immerse at night and then sprinkle on the following day, for sprinkling is not allowed until the sun is risen. And if any of these was done as early as the rise of dawn it is valid.","3365":"Thirteen rulings govern the carrion of a clean bird:There must be intention; It need not be rendered susceptible; It conveys food uncleanness if its minimum bulk is that of an egg; And it conveys uncleanness  when in one's gullet  if its minimum bulk is that of an olive; He that eats of it must wait  until sunset to be clean; Guilt is incurred on account of it for entering the sanctuary; Terumah is burned on account of it; He who eats a limb of it while it is alive suffers forty lashes; Slaughtering it or nipping off its neck cleanses it even if it is terefah, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: they do not cleanse it. Rabbi Yose says: the slaughtering  does cleanse it but nipping does not.","3366":"The large feathers and the down contract uncleanness and  convey uncleanness  but do not combine with the flesh to constitute the prescribed minimum. Rabbi Ishmael says: the down does combine with the flesh. The beak and the claws contract uncleanness  and  convey uncleanness and also combine with the flesh to constitute the prescribed minimum. Rabbi Yose says: also the ends  of the wings and the end  of the tail combine with the flesh to constitute the minimum since they are left unplucked on fattened birds.","3367":"The carrion of an unclean bird requires intention; and it must be rendered susceptible; It conveys food uncleanness  if its minimum bulk is that of an egg; The consumption of a half of half a loaf's bulk of it renders one's person unfit to eat terumah; There is no rule that an olive's worth defiles in the gullet; He who eats of it need not wait for sunset; No guilt is incurred on account of it for entering the sanctuary; But on account of it terumah must be burnt. He who eats a limb of it while it is alive is not subject to the penalty of forty stripes; Slaughtering it does not render it fit. The large feathers and the down contract uncleanness and convey uncleanness and combine with the flesh to constitute the prescribed minimum. The beak and the claws contract uncleanness and convey uncleanness and combine with the flesh to make up the prescribed minimum.","3368":"The hide, meat juice, sediment, dried-up meat, bones, sinews, horns and hooves join together to make up the minimum quantity in order to convey food-uncleanness, but not to make up the minimum quantity in order to convey nevelah-uncleanness. Similarly, if a man slaughtered an unclean animal for a Gentile and it still has convulsions, it can convey food-uncleanness, but it conveys nevelah-uncleanness only after it is dead, or its head has been chopped off. Scripture has thus made more cases that convey food-uncleanness than those that convey nevelah-uncleanness.","3369":"Food that contracted uncleanness from a \"father of uncleanness\" and one that contracted uncleanness from a derived uncleanness   may be combined together   to convey uncleanness according to the lighter grade of the two. How so? If the amount of half an egg of food that has first grade uncleanness and the amount of half an egg of food that has second grade uncleanness were mixed together, the two are regarded having second grade uncleanness. And if the amount of half of an egg of food that has second grade uncleanness and the amount of half an egg of food that has third grade uncleanness were mixed together, the two are regarded as having third grade of uncleanness. If the amount of an egg of food having first grade uncleanness and the amount of an egg of food having second grade uncleanness were mixed together, both are regarded   as having first grade uncleanness; But if they were then divided, each part is regarded as having second grade uncleanness. If each part separately fell on a loaf of terumah, they cause it to become unfit. But if the two fell together they cause it to have second grade uncleanness.","3370":"An egg's worth of food that has second degree uncleanness and an egg's worth of food that has third decree uncleanness that were mixed together are regarded as having second degree uncleanness. If they were then divided, each part is regarded as having only third degree uncleanness. If each part separately fell on a loaf of terumah they do not render it invalid. But if the two fell together they convey to it third degree uncleanness. An egg's worth of food that has first degree uncleanness and an egg's worth of food that has third degree uncleanness that were mixed together are regarded as having first degree uncleanness. If they were then divided, each part is regarded as having only second grade uncleanness, for even the third grade that touched the first has become only a second grade. If two eggs worth of food that have first degree uncleanness and two eggs worth of food that have second degree uncleanness were mixed together they are regarded as having first degree uncleanness. If they were then divided, each part is still regarded as having first degree uncleanness. But if they were divided into three or four parts, each is regarded as having second grade. If two eggs worth of food having second degree uncleanness and two eggs worth of food having third degree uncleanness were mixed together, they are regarded as having second degree uncleanness. If they were then divided, each part is still regarded as having second degree uncleanness. But if they were divided into three or four parts, each is regarded as having only third degree uncleanness.","3371":"Pieces of dough which are stuck to each other  or loaves stuck to each other, if one of them was defiled from a sheretz, they all become unclean in the first degree; If they were then separated they are still regarded as having first degree uncleanness. If one of them was defiled by a liquid they all have second degree uncleanness; If they were then separated they are still regarded as have second degree uncleanness. If one of them was defiled from the hands, they all become have third degree uncleanness; If they were then separated they are still regarded as having third degree of uncleanness.","3372":"A piece of dough that had first degree uncleanness, and then others became stuck to it, they all become unclean in the first degree. If they were separated, it still remains unclean in the first degree but all the others are have only second degree uncleanness. If the original piece had second degree uncleanness and then others became stuck to it, they all become unclean in the second degree; If they were separated, it still remains unclean in the second degree but all the others are only unclean in the third degree. If the original piece had third degree uncleanness, and then other became stuck to it, it remains unclean in the third degree but all the others remain clean, whether they were subsequently separated from it or whether they were not separated.","3373":"Holy loaves  in whose hollows there was holy water, if one contracted uncleanness from a sheretz, they all become unclean. In the case of loaves of terumah, uncleanness is conveyed to two loaves and one is invalidated. If there was dripping liquid between them, even in the case of terumah all become unclean.","3374":"A woman who  was preserving vegetables  in a pot and touched  a leaf outside the pot on a dry spot, even though the leaf had an egg's bulk of volume, it alone becomes unclean  while all the rest  remains clean. If she touched it at a wet spot: If there was an egg's bulk in the leaf, everything becomes unclean. If there was not an egg's bulk in it, it alone becomes unclean but all the rest remains clean. If it is returned into the pot, everything becomes unclean. If the woman was unclean due to contact with one who had corpse uncleanness, and she touched the leaf either at a wet spot or at a dry spot: If there was an egg's bulk in the leaf, everything becomes unclean; If there was not an egg's bulk in it, it alone becomes unclean but all the rest remains clean. If a woman who was a tevulat yom emptied out the pot with unwashed hands, and she observed some liquid on her hands, and it is uncertain whether it was splashed from the pot or whether a stalk had touched her hands, the vegetables are invalid   but the pot remains clean.","3375":"Rabbi Eliezer says: he who eats food with first degree uncleanness contracts first decree uncleanness; He who eats food with second degree uncleanness  contracts second degree uncleanness; With third degree uncleanness contracts third degree uncleanness. Rabbi Joshua says: he who eats food with first degree or with second degree uncleanness contracts second degree uncleanness; With third degree uncleanness, he contracts second degree uncleanness in regard to holy things but not in regard to terumah. All this applies to common food that was prepared in condition of cleanness that is appropriate for terumah.","3376":"First degree uncleanness in common food is unclean and conveys uncleanness; Second degree uncleanness invalidates but does not convey uncleanness. And third degree uncleanness may be eaten in a dish mixed with terumah.","3377":"First degree and second degree uncleanness in terumah are unclean and convey uncleanness; Third degree uncleanness causes invalidity but does not convey uncleanness. And fourth degree uncleanness may be eaten in a dish containing holy food.","3378":"First, second and third degrees of uncleanness in holy foods are unclean and convey uncleanness; Fourth degree of uncleanness is invalid and causes no uncleanness; And fifth degree of uncleanness   may be eaten in a dish containing holy food.","3379":"Second degree uncleanness in common food conveys uncleanness to unconsecrated liquids and causes invalidity to terumah food. Third degree of uncleanness in terumah conveys uncleanness to consecrated liquids and causes invalidity to holy food that was prepared in conditions of cleanness appropriate to holy food; But if it was only prepared under conditions of cleanness appropriate to terumah, it conveys uncleanness at a first and at a second remove, and causes invalidity to holy food at one additional remove.","3380":"Rabbi Eliezer says: the three of them are equivalent.The first degree of uncleanness in holy food, in terumah or in common food: conveys uncleanness at two removes  and causes invalidity at one additional remove in the case of holy food; conveys uncleanness at one remove and causes invalidity at one additional remove in the case of terumah; and causes invalidity in common food. The second degree of uncleanness in the case of all of them: conveys uncleanness at one remove  and causes invalidity at one additional remove  in the case of holy food; it conveys uncleanness to common liquids and causes invalidity of terumah food. The third degree of uncleanness in the case of all them: conveys uncleanness to holy liquids and causes invalidity to holy food.","3381":"If one eats food with second degree uncleanness   he must not work in an olive-press. Common food that was prepared under conditions proper to the cleanness of consecrated food is still regarded as common food. Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says: it is regarded as terumah to convey uncleanness at two removes and to render terumah invalid at one additional remove.","3382":"Sauce, bean-mash and milk, when in a condition of fluidity, are unclean in the first degree. If  they turned solid they become unclean in the second degree. If they again melted: If their bulk was exactly that of an egg, they are clean. But if it was more than the bulk of an egg they remain unclean, for as soon as the first drop issued forth it became unclean by contact with an egg's bulk.","3383":"Rabbi Meir says: oil always remains unclean in the first degree. And the sages say: honey also. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: also wine. A mass of olives that fell into an oven that was heated: If the olives were exactly the size of an egg it the oven remains pure; But if it was more than that of an egg the oven becomes unclean, for as soon as the first drop came out it became unclean by contact with an egg's bulk. If the olives were separated even if there was a se'ah of them, it remains clean.","3384":"A man who had corpse uncleanness who pressed olives or grapes: If its bulk was exactly that of an egg, the juice remains clean provided he does not touch the place on which the liquid is; But if the bulk was more than that of an egg, the juice becomes unclean, for as soon as the first drop came out, it became unclean by contact with an egg's bulk. If the person was a zav or a zavah the juice becomes unclean even if only one berry was pressed out, for as soon as the first drop came out it became unclean by carrying. If a zav milked a goat, the milk becomes unclean, for as soon as the first drop comes out it becomes unclean by carrying.","3385":"If an egg's bulk of food was left in the sun and it was lessened,  and so also in the case of an olive's bulk of corpse, an olive's bulk of carrion, a lentil's bulk of a sheretz, an olive's bulk of piggul, an olive's bulk of notar, or an olive's bulk of forbidden fat they become clean; Nor is one liable on account of these for transgressing the law of piggul, notar or forbidden fat. If they were then left out in the rain and they swelled, they become unclean and guilt is incurred on account of them for transgressing the law of piggul, notar or forbidden fat.","3386":"All cases of uncleanness are determined according to their appearance at the time they are found: If they were then unclean they are assumed to have been unclean all the time; And if clean they are assumed to have been clean all the time. If they were then covered they are assumed to have been covered all the time; And if uncovered they are assumed to have been uncovered all the time. If a needle was found full of rust or broken it is clean, for all doubtful cases of uncleanness are determined according to their appearance at the time they are found.","3387":"If a deaf-mute, a person not of sound senses, or a minor was found in an alley way   that contained something that was unclean, he is presumed to be clean. But any one of sound senses is presumed to be unclean. And anyone\/anything that lacks understanding to be inquired of is in a case of doubtful uncleanness presumed to be clean.","3388":"A child who was found at the side of a graveyard with lilies in his hand, and the lilies grew only in a place of uncleanness, he is nevertheless clean, for I could say that another person gathered them and gave them to him. So also a donkey that was in a graveyard, his harness remains clean.","3389":"A child  was found next to dough with a piece of dough in his hand: Rabbi Meir says that the dough  is clean; But the sages say that it is unclean, since it is the nature of a child to slap dough. Dough that bears traces of hens\u2019 pickings and there is unclean liquid in the same house: if there was distance enough between the liquid and the loaves for the hens to dry their mouths on the ground, the dough is clean. And in the case of a cow or a dog, if there was distance enough for it to lick its tongue. And in the case of all other beasts, if there was distance enough for their tongue to dry. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob holds the dough to be clean in the case of a dog who is smart; for it is not its habit to leave food and go after the water.","3390":"One who throws an unclean  object from one place to another: for instance a loaf  among keys  or a key  among loaves,  that which was clean remains clean. Rabbi Judah  says: if a loaf  was thrown among keys  the former becomes unclean, but if a key was thrown among loaves  the latter remain clean.","3391":"A dead sheretz that was held in the mouth of a weasel that was passing over loaves of terumah and it is doubtful whether the sheret did or did not touch them, in such condition of doubt the loaves are clean.","3392":"A weasel that had in its mouth a dead sheretz or a dog that had carrion in its mouth and they passed between clean persons or if clean persons passed between them,   their condition of doubt is deemed clean, since the uncleanness , had no resting place. If they were picking at them while these   lay on the ground,   and a person stated, \"I went to that place but I do not know whether I did or did not touch it,\"   his condition of doubt is deemed unclean, since the uncleanness had a resting place.","3393":"An olive's bulk of corpse was held in a raven's mouth and it is doubtful whether it overshadowed a person or vessels in a private domain: The person's condition of doubt is deemed to be unclean But the vessels\u2019 condition of doubt is deemed clean. One who drew water in ten buckets   and a dead sheretz was found in one of them,   it alone is deemed unclean but all the others remain clean. If one poured out from one vessel into another and a dead sheretz was found in the lower vessel, the upper one remains clean.","3394":"On account of six doubtful cases of uncleanness terumah is burned: On account of the doubt of a bet ha-peras grave area, On account of earth about which there is doubt whether it came from the land of the gentiles, On account of a doubt about the garments of an \u2018am ha-arez; On account of a doubt about found vessels found by chance; On account of found spit, On account of a doubt about human urine that was near the urine of a beast. On account of a certainty of having touched these which causes the doubtful uncleanness, terumah is burned. Rabbi Yose says: also on account of their doubtful contact in a private domain; But the sages say: in a private domain the terumah is only held in suspense and in a public domain it is deemed clean.","3395":"Two kinds spittle, one of which was possibly unclean and the other was definitely clean: Terumah is to be held in suspense if touched by one who touched or carried or shifted one of the two kinds of spittle while they were in a private domain; Or who touched one of them in a public domain while it was still moist; Or who carried it whether it was moist or dry. If there was but one kind of possibly unclean spittle and a person touched, carried or shifted it in a public domain, terumah is burned on account of it; And one does not even need to say that this is the case if it was in a private domain.","3396":"These are the cases of doubtful uncleanness that the sages declared to be clean:A doubt concerning drawn water for a mikveh, A doubt concerning an object of uncleanness that floated upon the water. A doubt concerning liquids as to whether they have contracted uncleanness it is deemed unclean, but if it was whether uncleanness has been conveyed it is deemed clean. A doubt concerning the hands as to whether they have contracted uncleanness, have conveyed uncleanness or have attained cleanness, they are deemed clean.

How so? If a pigeon fell into a wine-press and one intended to pick it out for an idolater, it becomes susceptible to uncleanness; but if he intended it for a dog it is not susceptible to uncleanness. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri rules that it is susceptible to uncleanness. If a deaf mute, one not of sound senses or a minor intended it as food, it remains insusceptible. But if they picked it up it becomes susceptible; since only an act of theirs is effective while their intention is of no consequence.","3437":"The outer parts of vessels that have contracted uncleanness from liquids: Rabbi Eliezer says: they defile liquids but they do not disqualify foods.

Rabbi Dosa says: crumbled food cannot be combined together.","3439":"If a stick is completely covered with unclean liquid, as soon as it has touched the water in the mikveh, it becomes clean, the words of Rabbi Joshua. But the sages say: only when the whole of it is immersed. A flow from one vessel to the other or a slope of dripping moisture does not serve as a connective either for uncleanness or for cleanness. A pool of water serves as a connective in respect both of uncleanness and cleanness.","3440":"At what stage do olives become susceptible to uncleanness?When they exude the moisture produced by their lying in the vat  but not the one produced while they are still in the basket, according to the words of Bet Shammai. Rabbi Shimon says: the minimum time prescribed for proper exudation is three days. Bet Hillel says: as soon as three olives stick together. Rabban Gamaliel says: as soon as their preparation is finished, and the sages agree with his view.","3441":"If he finished the gathering but intended to buy some more, or if he had finished buying but intended to borrow some more, or if  a time of mourning, a wedding feast or some other hindrance befell him then even if zavim and zavot trampled over them   they remain clean. If any unclean liquids fell upon them, only the place where it touched them becomes unclean. Any liquid that comes out of them is clean.","3442":"When their preparation is finished behold they are susceptible to uncleanness. If an unclean liquid fell upon them they become unclean. The sap that issues from them: Rabbi Eliezer says it is clean, But the sages say that it is unclean. Rabbi Shimon says: they did not dispute the ruling that sap that issues from olives is clean. But about what did they dispute? About that which comes from the vat: That Rabbi Eliezer says is clean And the sages say is unclean.","3443":"One who had finished the gathering of his olives and put aside one basketful, let   him put it in the container in front of a  priest, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: he must hand him over the key immediately. Rabbi Shimon says:   within twenty-four hours.","3444":"One who put his olives in a basket that they might be softened so that they will be easy to press, they become susceptible to uncleanness; If he put them in a basket to be softened so that they may be salted: Bet Shammai says: they become susceptible. Bet Hillel says: they do not become susceptible. One who splits his olives with unwashed hands, he causes them to be unclean.","3445":"If one put his olives on a roof to dry, even though they are piled up to the height of a cubit, they do not become susceptible to uncleanness. If he put them in the house to putrify, even though he intends to take them up on the roof, or if he put them on the roof so that they might open so that they could be salted,  they become susceptible to uncleanness. If he put them in the house while he secured his roof or until he could take them elsewhere, they do not become susceptible to uncleanness.","3446":"If one wants to take from them a quantity sufficient for one pressing or for two pressings:Bet Shammai says: he may scrape off what he requires in a condition of uncleanness, but he must cover up what he takes in a condition of cleanness. Bet Hillel says: he may also cover it up in a condition of uncleanness. Rabbi Yose says: he may dig out what he requires with metal axes and carry it to the press in a condition of uncleanness.","3447":"If a dead sheretz was found in the milling stones, only the place that it has touched becomes unclean. But if moisture was running, all become unclean. If it was found on the leaves, the olive-press men shall be asked whether they can say, \"we did not touch it.\" If it touched the mass of olives, even by as little as the bulk of a barley grain, the mass becomes unclean.","3448":"If it was found on broken off pieces but it touched as much as an egg's bulk, the entire mass becomes unclean. If it was found on broken off pieces that lay upon other broken off pieces, even though it touched as much as an egg's bulk, only the place it touched becomes unclean. If it was found between the wall and the olives, they remain clean. If it was found on olives that were lying on the roof, the olives in the vat remain clean. If it was found in the vat, the olives on the roof are also regarded as unclean. If it was found burnt upon the olives, and so also in the case of a rag that was completely worn out, the olives remain clean, because all cases of uncleanness are determined in accordance with their appearance at the time they are found.","3449":"If one locked in olive-workers in the olive-press and there were objects in there that had midras uncleanness: Rabbi Meir says: the olive-press is deemed to be unclean. Rabbi Judah says: the olive-press remains clean. Rabbi Shimon says: if they regard them  as clean, the olive-press is deemed unclean;  but if they regard them as unclean,the olive-press remains clean. Rabbi Yose: why are they unclean?  Only because the am haaretz is not an expert in the laws of hesset.","3450":"If the olive-workers in an olive-press went in and out, and in the olive-press there was unclean liquid, if there is space enough on the ground between the liquid and the olives for their feet to be dried on the ground, the olive workers remain clean. If something unclean was found in front of olive-workers in the olive-press or grape harvesters, they are believed to say, \"We have not touched it.\" And the same law applies also to the young children among them. They may go outside the door of the olive-press and relieve themselves behind the wall, and still be deemed clean. How far may they go and still be deemed clean? As far as they can be seen.","3451":"If the olive-workers or the grape harvesters were only brought within the domain of the cavern, it is sufficient, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says: he should stand over them until they immerse. Rabbi Shimon say: if they regard the vessels as clean, one must stand over them until they immerse; but if they regard them as unclean, it is not necessary to stand over them until they immerse.","3452":"One who puts his grapes into the wine-press from the baskets or from what was spread out on the ground: Bet Shammai says: he must put them in with clean hands, and if he puts them in with unclean hands he defiles them. Bet Hillel says: he may put them in with unclean hands and then he may set aside his terumah in a condition of cleanness. If they are taken from the grape-pot or from what was spread out on leaves, all agree that they must be put in with clean hands, and if they are put in with unclean hands they become unclean.","3453":"One who eats grapes out of the baskets or from what is spread out on the ground, even though they burst and dripped into the wine-press, the wine-press remains clean. If he eats the grapes out of a grape-basket or from what was spread out on leaves, and a single berry dropped into the vat: If it has a seal all in the vat remains clean; But if it has no seal, all in the vat becomes unclean. If he dropped some of the grapes and trod upon them in an empty part of the wine-press: If the bulk of the grapes was exactly that of an egg, the contents remain clean; But if it was more than the bulk of an egg, the contents become unclean, for so soon as the first drop came out it contracted uncleanness from the remainder whose bulk is that of an egg.","3454":"One who was standing and speaking by the edge of the cistern and some spittle squirted from his mouth, and there arises the doubt whether it reached the cistern or not, the condition of doubt is regarded as clean.","3455":"If one is emptying out the cistern into jars and a dead sheretz was found in the first jar, all the other jars are deemed unclean; but if it was found in the last, only that one is unclean but all the others remain clean. When does this apply? When the wine was drawn directly with each jar, but if it was drawn with a ladle and a dead creeping thing was found in one of the jars, it alone is unclean. When does this apply? Only when the man examined the jars but did not cover them up or covered them up but did not examine them; But if he both examined them and covered them up and a dead creeping thing was found: If in one jar, all the contents of the cistern are deemed unclean. If it was found in the cistern, all its contents are deemed unclean And if it was found in the ladle all the contents of the cistern   are deemed unclean.","3456":"The space between the rollers and grape skins is regarded  as a public domain. A vineyard in front of the grape harvesters is deemed  to be a private domain and one which is behind the harvesters  is deemed   to be a public domain. When is this so? When the public enter at one end and go out at the other. The vessels of the olive-press, the wine-press and the basket-press, if they are of wood, need only be dried  and they become clean; But if they are of reed grass they must be left unused for twelve months, or they must be scalded in hot water. Rabbi Yose says: if he put them  in the current of the river, it is sufficient.","3457":"If one had collected hallah  portions with the intention of keeping them separate, but in the meantime they had become stuck together: Bet Shammai say: they are connected in the case of a tevul yom. But Bet Hillel say: they are not connected. Pieces of dough of terumah  that had become stuck together, Or loaves  that had become joined, or one who bakes a batter-cake on top of another batter-cake before it could form a crust in the oven, or the froth  on the water that was bubbling, or the first scum  that rises when boiling groats of beans, or the scum of new wine (r. Judah says: also that of rice): Bet Shammai say: they are connected  in the case of a tevul yom. But Bet Hillel say: they are not connected. They agree that they serve as connectives if they come into contact with other kinds of uncleanness, whether they be of minor or major grades.","3458":"If one had collected pieces of hallah without the intention of separating them afterwards, or a batter-cake that had been baked on another after a crust had formed in the oven, or froth had appeared in the water prior to its bubbling up, or the second scum that appeared in the boiling of groats of beans, or the scum of old wine, or that of oil of all kinds, or of lentils, Rabbi Judah says: also that of beans; All these are defiled when touched by a tevul yom. And there is no need to say, this is the case if touched by other sources of uncleanness.","3459":"The nail shaped knob   on the back of the loaf, or the small globule of salt,   or the burnt crust less than a finger's breadth: Rabbi Yose says: whatever is eaten with the loaf becomes unclean when touched by the tevul yom. And one doesn't need to say, this is so when touched by other unclean things.","3460":"A pebble in a loaf or a large globule of salt, or a lupine, or a burnt crust larger than a finger's breadth Rabbi Yose says: whatever is not eaten with the loaf remains clean even when touched by a father of impurity; And it isn't even necessary to say is this so when touched by a tevul yom.","3461":"Unshelled barley or spelt, root of crowfoot, asafoetida,  silphium--Rabbi Judah says: even black beans remain clean even when coming into contact with a \u2018father of uncleanness\u2019, and there is no need to say if touched by a tevul yom, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: they are clean if touched by a tevul yom, but unclean when touched by other sources of impurity. Shelled barley or spelt, or wheat whether shelled or unshelled, or black cumin, or sesame or pepper Rabbi Judah says: also white beans become unclean even when touched by a tevul yom, and there is no need to say when they have come into contact with other sources of impurity.","3462":"Liquids that come out of a tevul yom are like those which he has touched: neither of them causes defilement. With regard to all others that are unclean, be they of minor  or major  degree, the liquids that come out of them are like those they touch; both have first degree impurity. Except for liquid that is a \"father of impurity.\"","3463":"A pot which was full of liquid and a tevul yom touched it: If it is terumah, the liquid is disqualified, but the pot is clean. But if the liquid is non-sacred hullin then all remains clean. If his hands were defiled and he touched the liquids in the pot, all becomes unclean. This is a case defiled hands are treated more stringently than a tevul yom. But a greater stringency is applied to a tevul yom than to defiled hands, since a doubtful tevul yom disqualifies terumah, but doubts with regard to defiled hands are clean.","3464":"If the porridge was of terumah and the garlic or oil it contained was of hullin, and a tevul yom touched part of them, he has disqualified the whole thing; But if the porridge was of hullin and the garlic or oil it contained was of terumah, and a tevul yom touched part of them, he disqualifies only the part he has touched. If the greater part was garlic then they go after the majority. Rabbi Judah said: When is this so? When it formed one cohesive mass in the pot, but if it was scattered small in the mortar, then it is clean, since he wishes that it should be scattered. Similarly with all other mashed foods which were mashed with liquids. But those which are usually mashed with liquids and yet were mashed without liquids, though they formed one cohesive mass in the pot, are regarded as a cake of preserved figs.","3465":"If the porridge and batter-cake were of hullin and oil of terumah was floating above them, and a tevul yom touched the oil, he disqualifies only the oil. If he stirred it altogether, all the places where the oil goes are disqualified.","3466":"Sanctified meat over which the porridge crusted, and a tevul yom touched the crust, the slices of meat are permitted. But if he touched one of the slices, that slice and all the crust that comes up with it form a connective the one with the other. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: the two of them serve as connectives to each other. Similarly, with cooked beans that have formed a layer over pieces of bread. Beans or other foods cooked in a pot: when they are still separate, do not serve as connectives; but when they become a solid pulp, they do act as connectives. If they formed several solid masses, they are to be counted. If oil floats on wine and a tevul yom touched the oil, only the oil is disqualified. But Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: each serves as a connective with the other.","3467":"A jug which sunk into a cistern containing wine, and a tevul yom touched it: If he touched it from the rim and inwards, it serves as a connective; If from the rim and outwards, it does not serve as a connective. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: even though the level of wine in the cistern is the height of a man above the sunken jar, and he touched the wine directly above the mouth of the jar, it serves as a connective.","3468":"If a jug had a hole either at its neck, bottom or sides, and a tevul yom touched it at the hole, it becomes unclean. Rabbi Judah says: if the hole is at its neck or bottom it becomes unclean; but if on its sides, on this side or on that, it remains clean. If one poured liquid from one vessel into another, and a tevul yom touched the stream, and there was something within the vessel, then whatsoever he touches is neutralized in a hundred and one.","3469":"A bubble on a jug which was pierced with holes on its inner side and on its outer side, whether above or below: If the holes are opposite one another, it becomes unclean if touched by a \"father of uncleanness\" and it becomes unclean if it is in a tent in which there is a corpse. If the inner hole is below and the outer above, it becomes unclean if touched by a \"father of uncleanness,\" and it becomes unclean in a tent in which there is a corpse. If the inner hole is above and the outer below, it remains clean if touched by a \"father of uncleanness,\" but it becomes unclean in a tent in which there is a corpse.","3470":"Handles to food, which count as connectives when touched by a \"father of uncleanness,\" also count as connectives when touched by a tevul yom. If a food was divided into two yet a small part was still attached: Rabbi Meir says: if one takes hold of the larger part and the smaller part is pulled away with it, behold it is like it. Rabbi Judah says: if one takes hold of the smaller part and the greater is also pulled away with it, then behold it is like it. Rabbi Nehemiah says: this refers to the case of the clean portion. But the sages say: it refers to the unclean portion. In the case of all other foods, those usually held by the leaf should be taken by the leaf, and those usually held by the stalk should be taken by the stalk.","3471":"If a beaten egg was on top of vegetables of terumah, and a tevul yom touches the egg, then he disqualifies only that stalk of the vegetables that is opposite the part of the egg he touched. Rabbi Yose says: the entire upper layer. But if it was arranged like a cap  it does not serve as a connective.","3472":"The streak of an egg that had become congealed on the side of a pan and a tevul yom touched it: If within the rim of the pan it serves as a connective; But if outside the rim, it does not serve as a connective. Rabbi Yose says that the streak and the part that can be peeled away with it serves as a connective. The same applies to beans that had congealed on the rim of the pot.","3473":"Dough that had been mixed with dough of terumah or that had been leavened with yeast of terumah, is not disqualified by tevul yom. Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon declare it unfit. Dough that had become susceptible to uncleanness by a liquid, and it was kneaded with produce juice, and later touched by a tevul yom: Rabbi Elazar ben Judah of Barthotha says in the name of Rabbi Joshua: he disqualifies all of it. Rabbi Akiva says in his name: he disqualifies only the part that he touched.","3474":"Vegetables of hullin were cooked with oil of terumah and a tevul yom touched it: Rabbi Elazar ben Judah of Bartota says in the name of Rabbi Joshua: he has disqualified the whole thing. Rabbi Akiva says in his name: he disqualifies only the part that he touched.","3475":"A clean person who chewed food and it fell on his garments and on a loaf of terumah, it the loaf is not susceptible to uncleanness. If he ate crushed olives or moist dates, or if his intention was to suck out the pit, and it fell on his garments and on a loaf of terumah, it is susceptible to uncleanness. If he ate dried olives, or dried figs or it was not his intention to suck out the pit, and they fell on his garments and on a loaf of terumah, it is not susceptible to uncleanness. This is the case irrespective of whether it was a clean person or a tevul yom who was eating. Rabbi Meir says: in either case it becomes susceptible to uncleanness in the case of a tevul yom, since liquids issuing from unclean persons render anything susceptible whether it was to his liking or not. But the sages say: a tevul yom is not regarded as an unclean person.","3476":"If food that was tithe had been rendered susceptible to impurity by a liquid, and a tevul yom or one with unwashed hands touched it, terumah of tithe  may still be removed from it in purity, since it only has third degree uncleanness, and third degree uncleanness counts as clean in hullin.","3477":"A woman who is a tevulat yom may knead dough, cut off the hallah, and set it apart, and she should arrange it on an Egyptian basket,  or on a tray, and then bring it near  and call it by its name. For it the dough has third degree uncleanness and third degree uncleanness is clean in hullin.","3478":"A trough which is a tevulat yom, one may knead dough in it and cut off the portion for hallah and bring it near and call it by name as hallah; for it the trough has third degree uncleanness and third degree uncleanness is clean in hullin.","3479":"A flagon was a tevul yom and they filled it from a cask containing tithes from which terumah had not yet been taken: If one said, let this be terumah of tithe after nightfall, it becomes terumah of tithe. But if he said: let this be the food for the eruv, he has said nothing. If the cask was broken, the contents of the flagon still remain tithe from which terumah had not yet been taken. If the flagon was broken, then what is in the cask still remains tithe from which terumah had not yet been taken.","3480":"Originally they said: one may redeem second tithe for the produce of an am ha-arez. Later they reconsidered and said: also for money of his.Originally they said that if a man was being led out to execution and said, \u201cWrite a get for my wife\u201d, they may write a get and give it to her. Later they reconsidered and said, even if he were leaving on a sea voyage or on a caravan journey. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: even if he were dangerously ill.","3481":"If Ashkelon grappling-irons were broken but their hooks remained, they remain susceptible to impurity. If a pitch-fork, winnowing-fan, or rake, and the same applies to a hair-comb, lost one of its teeth and it was replaced by one of metal, it is susceptible to impurity. And concerning all these Rabbi Joshua said: the scribes have here introduced a new principle of law, and I have no explanation to offer.","3482":"If one was taking terumah from a cistern and said: \"Let this be terumah provided it comes up safely,\" it is implied that he meant safely from being broken or spilled,   but not from becoming impure; But Rabbi Shimon says: also from impurity. If it were broken, it does not render the contents of the cistern subject to the restrictions of terumah. How far away can it be broken and still not make the contents of the cistern subject to terumah restrictions?  Only so far that if it rolls back, it can reach the cistern. Rabbi Yose says: even if one had the intention of making such a stipulation, but did not do so, and it broke, it does not make the contents of the cistern subject to terumah restrictions, for this is a stipulation laid down by the court.","3483":"A minimum of a quarter of a log of water must be poured over the hands for one person and even for two. A minimum of half  a log must be poured over the hands for three or four persons. A minimum of one log is sufficient for five, ten, or one hundred persons. Rabbi Yose says: as long as there is not less than a quarter of a log left for the last person among them. More water may be added to the second water, but more may not be added to the first water.","3484":"Water may be poured over the hands out of any kind of vessel, even out of vessels made of animal dung, out of vessels made of stone or out of vessels made of clay. Water may not be poured from the sides of broken vessels or from the bottom of a ladle or from the stopper of a jar. Nor may one pour water over the hands of his fellow out of his cupped hands. Because one may not draw, nor sanctify, nor sprinkle the water of purification,   nor pour water over the hands except in a vessel. And only vessels closely covered with a lid protect their contents from uncleanness. And  only vessels protect their contents from uncleanness inside earthenware vessels.","3485":"Water which had become so unfit that it could not be drunk by a beast: If it was in a vessel it is invalid, But if it was in the ground  it is valid. If there fell into the water, dye, or gum or sulphate of copper and its color changed, it is invalid. If a person did any work with it or soaked his bread in it, it is invalid. Shimon of Teman says: even if he intended to soak his bread in one water and it fell into another water the water is valid.","3486":"If he cleansed vessels with the water or scrubbed  measures with it, the water is invalid. If he rinsed with it vessels which had already been rinsed or new vessels, it is valid. Rabbi Yose declares the water invalid if they were new vessels.","3487":"Water in which the baker dips his loaves is invalid; But if he moistened his hands in the water it is valid. All are fit to pour water over the hands, even a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor. A person may place the jug between his knees and pour out the water Or he may turn the jug on its side and pour it out. A monkey may pour water over the hands. Rabbi Yose declares these latter two cases invalid.","3488":"If he poured water over one of his hands with a single rinsing his hand becomes clean. If over both his hands with a single rinsing: Rabbi Meir declares them to be unclean until he pours a minimum of a quarter of a log of water over them. If a loaf of terumah fell on the water the loaf is clean. Rabbi Yose declares it to be unclean.","3489":"If he poured the first water over his hands while standing in one place, and the second water over his hands while standing in another place, and a loaf of terumah fell on the first water, the loaf becomes unclean. But if it fell on the second water it remains clean. If he poured the first and the second water while standing in one place, and a loaf of terumah fell onto the water, the loaf becomes unclean. If he poured the first water over his hands and a splinter or a piece of gravel is found on his hands, his hands remain unclean, because the latter water only makes the first water on the hands clean. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: if any creature from the water was on the hands while they are being cleaned they are clean.","3490":"Hands become unclean and are made clean as far as the joint. How so? If he poured the first water over the hands as far as the joint and poured the second water over the hands beyond the joint and the latter flowed back to the hands, the hands are clean. If he poured the first and the second water over the hands beyond the joint and they flowed back to the hands, the hands remain unclean. If he poured the first water over one of his hands and then changed his mind and poured the second water over both his hands, they are unclean. If he poured the first water over both his hands and then changed his mind and poured the second water over one of his hands, his one hand becomes clean. If he poured water over one of his hands and rubbed it on the other hand it remains unclean. If he rubbed it on his head or on the wall it is clean. Water may be poured over the hands of four or five persons, each hand being by the side of the other, or being one above the other, provided that the hands are held loosely so that the water flows between them.","3491":"If there was a doubt whether any work has been done with the water or not, A doubt whether the water contains the requisite quantity or not, A doubt whether it is unclean or clean, In these cases the doubt is considered to be clean because they have said in a case of doubt concerning hands as to whether they have become unclean or have conveyed uncleanness or have become clean, they are considered to be clean. Rabbi Yose says: in a case of doubt as to whether they have become clean they are considered to be unclean. How so? If his hands were clean and there were two unclean loaves before him and there was a doubt whether he touched them or not; Or if his hands were unclean and there were two clean loaves before him and there was a doubt whether he touched them or not; Or if one of his hands was unclean and the other clean and there were two clean loaves before him and he touched one of them and there was a doubt whether he touched it with the unclean hand or with the clean hand; Or if his hands were clean and there were two loaves before him one of which was unclean and the other clean and he touched one of them and there was a doubt whether he touched the unclean one or the clean one; Or if one of his hands was unclean and the other clean and there were two loaves before him one of which was unclean and the other clean, and he touched both of them, and there is a doubt whether the unclean hand touched the unclean loaf or whether the clean hand touched the clean loaf or whether the clean hand touched the unclean loaf or whether the unclean hand touched the clean loaf The hands remain in the same state as they were before and the loaves remain in the same state as they were before.","3492":"If a person puts his hands inside a house with scale disease, his hands have first degree uncleanness, the words of Rabbi Akiba. But the sages say: his hands have second degree uncleanness. Whoever defiles garments: at the time when he touches the uncleanness, he defiles hands so that they have first degree uncleanness, the words of Rabbi Akiba. But the sages say: such that they have second degree of uncleanness. They said to Rabbi Akiba: where do we find anywhere that hands have first degree uncleanness? He said to them: but how is it possible for them to become unclean with first degree uncleanness without his whole body becoming unclean? Only in these cases can they have first degree uncleanness. Foods and vessels which have been defiled by liquids convey second degree of uncleanness to the hands, the words of Rabbi Joshua. But the sages say: that which has been defiled by a father of uncleanness conveys uncleanness to the hands, but that which has been defiled by an offspring of uncleanness does not defiled the hands. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said: it happened that a certain woman came before my father and said to him, \"My hands went into the air-space inside an earthenware vessel.\"  He said to her: \"My daughter, what was the cause of its uncleanness?\"  But I did not hear what she said to him. The sages said: the matter is clear that which has been defiled by a father of uncleanness conveys uncleanness to the hands, but that which has been rendered unclean by an offspring of uncleanness does not defiled the hands.","3493":"Anything which disqualifies terumah defiles hands with a second degree of uncleanness. One unwashed hand defiles the other hand, the words of Rabbi Joshua. But the sages say: that which has second degree of uncleanness cannot convey second degree of uncleanness. He said to them: But do not the Holy Scriptures which have second degree of uncleanness defile the hands? They said to him: the laws of the Torah may not be argued from the laws of the scribes, nor may the laws of the scribes be argued from the laws of the Torah, nor may the laws of the scribes be argued from other laws of the scribes.","3494":"The straps of the tefillin when connected with the tefillin boxes defile the hands. Rabbi Shimon says: the straps of the tefillin do not defile the hands.","3495":"The margin on a scroll   which is above or below or at the beginning or at the end defiles the hands. Rabbi Judah says: the margin at the end does not render unclean the hands until a handle is fastened to it.","3496":"A scroll on which the writing has become erased and eighty-five letters remain, as many as are in the section beginning, \"And it came to pass when the ark set forward\" defiles the hands. A single sheet on which there are written eighty-five letters, as many as are in the section beginning, \"And it came to pass when the ark set forward\", defiles the hands. All the Holy Scriptures defile the hands. The Song of Songs and Kohelet defile the hands. Rabbi Judah says: the Song of Songs defiles the hands, but there is a dispute about Kohelet. Rabbi Yose says: Kohelet does not defile the hands, but there is a dispute about the Song of Songs. Rabbi Shimon says: the ruling about Kohelet is one of the leniencies of Bet Shammai and one of the stringencies of Bet Hillel. Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai said: I have received a tradition from the seventy-two elders on the day when they appointed Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah head of the academy that the Song of Songs and Kohelet defile the hands. Rabbi Akiba said: Far be it! No man in Israel disputed that the Song of Songs saying that it does not defile the hands. For the whole world is not as worthy as the day on which the Song of Songs was given to Israel; for all the writings are holy but the Song of Songs is the holy of holies. If they had a dispute, they had a dispute only about Kohelet. Rabbi Yohanan ben Joshua the son of the father-in-law of Rabbi Akiva said in accordance with the words of Ben Azzai: so they disputed and so they reached a decision.","3497":"On that day the votes were counted and they decided that a footbath holding from two logs to nine kavs which was cracked could contract midras  uncleanness. Because Rabbi Akiva said a footbath must be considered according to its designation.","3498":"On that day they said: all animal sacrifices  which have been sacrificed under the name of some other offering  are nevertheless valid,  but they are not accounted to their owners as a fulfillment of their obligations,  with the exception of the pesah  and the sin-offering. This is true of the pesah in its correct time and the sin-offering at any time. Rabbi Eliezer says: with the exception also of the guilt-offering; so that this refers to the pesah in its correct time and to the sin- and guilt-offerings at any time. Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai said: I received a tradition from the seventy-two elders on the day when they appointed Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah head of the college that all animal sacrifices which are eaten and which have not been sacrificed under their own name are nevertheless valid, but they are not accounted to their owners as a fulfillment of their obligations, with the exception of the pesah and the sin-offering. Ben Azzai only added to these exceptions the wholly burnt-offering, but the sages did not agree with him.","3499":"On that day they said: what is the law applying to Ammon and Moab in the seventh year? Rabbi Tarfon decreed tithe for the poor. And Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah decreed second tithe. Rabbi Ishmael said: Elazar ben Azariah, you must produce your proof because you are expressing the stricter view and whoever expresses a stricter view has the burden to produce the proof. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said to him: Ishmael, my brother, I have not deviated from the sequence of years, Tarfon, my brother, has deviated from it and the burden is upon him to produce the proof. Rabbi Tarfon answered: Egypt is outside the land of Israel, Ammon and Moab are outside the land of Israel: just as Egypt must give tithe for the poor in the seventh year,   so must Ammon and Moab give tithe for the poor in the seventh year. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah answered: Babylon is outside the land of Israel, Ammon and Moab are outside the land of Israel: just as Babylon must give second tithe in the seventh year, so must Ammon and Moab give second tithe in the seventh year. Rabbi Tarfon said: on Egypt which is near, they imposed tithe for the poor so that the poor of Israel might be supported by it during the seventh year; so on Ammon and Moab which are near, we should impose tithe for the poor so that the poor of Israel may be supported by it during the seventh year. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said to him: Behold, you are like one who would benefit them with gain, yet you are really as one who causes them to perish. Would you rob the heavens so that dew or rain should not descend?   As it is said, \"Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me. But you: How have we robbed You? In tithes and heave-offerings\" (Malakhi 3:8). Rabbi Joshua said: Behold, I shall be as one who replies on behalf of Tarfon, my brother, but not in accordance with the substance of his arguments. The law regarding Egypt is a new act and the law regarding Babylon is an old act, and the law which is being argued before us is a new act. A new act should be argued from another new act, but a new act should not be argued from an old act. The law regarding Egypt is the act of the elders and the law regarding Babylon is the act of the prophets, and the law which is being argued before us is the act of the elders. Let one act of the elders be argued from another act of the elders, but let not an act of the elders be argued from an act of the prophets. The votes were counted and they decided that Ammon and Moab should give tithe for the poor in the seventh year. And when Rabbi Yose ben Durmaskit  visited Rabbi Eliezer  in Lod he said to him: what new thing did you have in the house of study today? He said to him: their votes were counted and they decided that Ammon and Moab must give tithe for the poor in the seventh year. Rabbi Eliezer wept and said: \"The counsel of the Lord is with them that fear him: and his covenant, to make them know it\" (Psalms 25:14).  Go and tell them: Don't worry about your voting. I received a tradition from Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai who heard it from his teacher, and his teacher from his teacher, and so back to a halachah given to Moses from Sinai, that Ammon and Moab must give tithe for the poor in the seventh year.","3500":"On that day Judah, an Ammonite convert, came and stood before them in the house of study. He said to them: Do I have the right to enter into the assembly? Rabban Gamaliel said to him: you are forbidden. Rabbi Joshua said to him: you are permitted. Rabban Gamaliel said to him: the verse says, \"An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord: even to the tenth generation\" they have already returned. Rabbi Joshua said to him: another verse says, \"I will return the captivity of my people Israel and Judah\" (Amos 9:14).  Yet they have not yet returned. So they permitted him to enter the assembly.","3501":"The Aramaic sections in Ezra and Daniel defile the hands. If an Aramaic section was written in Hebrew, or a Hebrew section was written in Aramaic, or Hebrew which was written with Hebrew script, it does not defile the hands. It never defiles the hands until it is written in the Assyrian script, on parchment, and in ink.","3502":"The Sadducees say: we complain against you, Pharisees, because you say that the Holy Scriptures defile the hands, but the books of Homer  do not defile the hands. Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai said: Have we nothing against the Pharisees but this?   Behold they say that the bones of a donkey are clean, yet the bones of Yohanan the high priest are unclean. They said to him: according to the affection for them, so is their impurity, so that nobody should make spoons out of the bones of his father or mother. He said to them: so also are the Holy Scriptures according to the affection for them, so is their uncleanness. The books of Homer which are not precious do not defile the hands.","3503":"The Sadducees say: we complain against you, Pharisees, that you declare an uninterrupted flow of a liquid to be clean. The Pharisees say: we complain against you, Sadducees, that you declare a stream of water which flows from a burial-ground to be clean? The Sadducees say: we complain against you, Pharisees, that you say, my ox or donkey which has done injury is liable, yet my male or female slave who has done injury is not liable. Now if in the case of my ox or my donkey for which I am not responsible if they do not fulfill religious duties, yet I am responsible for their damages, in the case of my male or female slave for whom I am responsible to see that they fulfill mitzvot, how much more so that I should be responsible for their damages? They said to them: No, if you argue about my ox or my donkey which have no understanding, can you deduce from there anything concerning a male or female slave who do have understanding? So that if I were to anger either of them and they would go and burn another person's stack, should I be liable to make restitution?","3504":"A Galilean min said: I complain against you Pharisees, that you write the name of the ruler and the name of Moses together on a divorce document. The Pharisees said: we complain against you, Galilean min, that you write the name of the ruler together with the divine name on a single page of Torah? And furthermore that you write the name of the ruler above and the divine name below? As it is said, \"And Pharoah said, Who is the Lord that I should hearken to his voice to let Israel go?\" But when he was smitten what did he say? \"The Lord is righteous\" (Exodus 9:27).","3505":"If a man has seen one issue of zov: Bet Shammai says: he is to be compared to a woman who observes a day for each day. But Bet Hillel says: he is to be compared to one who has had a seminal emission. Should he see one day and on the second it stopped, and on the third day he saw two issues, or one issue that was as copious as two: Bet Shammai says: he is a full zav. But Bet Hillel says: he defiles those objects on which he sits or lies, and must also go into running water, but he is exempt from the sacrifice. Rabbi Elazar ben Yehudah said: Bet Shammai agrees that in such a case he is not real zav. What do they disagree about? The case of one who saw two issues, or one issue that was as copious as two on one day, and stopped on the second day, and on the third day he saw another issue. Bet Shammai says: he is a real zav; But Bet Hillel say: he only defiles those objects on which he sits or lies, and must also go into running water, but he is exempt from the sacrifice.","3506":"If one sees an issue of semen on the third day of counting his zov: Bet Shammai says: it undoes the two preceding days; But Bet Hillel says: it undoes only that day. Rabbi Ishmael says: one who sees it on the second day, it undoes the preceding day. But Rabbi Akiva says: it matters not whether he saw it on the second day or on the third day: Bet Shammai says: it undoes the two preceding days; And Bet Hillel says: it undoes only that day. But they agree that if he saw it on the fourth day of counting it undoes only that day. This is if he saw semen; but he saw zov, then even if this had occurred on the seventh day, it undoes all the days that had preceded.","3507":"If he saw one issue on one day and two on the next day, or two on one day and one on the next day, or three on three consecutive days, or three nights, he is a full zav.","3508":"If he saw one issue and it stopped long enough for an immersion and a drying, and after that he saw two issues, or one as copious as two; Or if he saw two issues or one as copious as two, and it stopped long enough for an immersion and a drying, and after that he again saw an issue, he is a full zav.","3509":"If he saw one issue which was as copious as three, lasting as long as it takes to go from Gad-Yav to Shiloah, which is the time it would take to bathe and dry twice, he becomes a full zav. If he saw one issue which was as copious as two, he defiles objects on which he lies or sits and he must immerse in running water, but he is exempt from bringing a sacrifice. Rabbi Yose said: they have not spoken of \"one issue as copious\" unless there was sufficient to make up three.","3510":"If he saw one issue during the day and another at twilight, or one at twilight and the other the next day: If he knew that part of the issue occurred at day-time and part the next day, he is certain with regard to a sacrifice and uncleanness. But if it is in doubt whether part of the issue occurred at day-time and part on the next day he is certain with regard to uncleanness, but in one of doubt in with regard a sacrifice. If he had seen issues on two separate days at twilight, he is in doubt both with regard to defilement and with regard to a sacrifice. If he had seen only one issue at twilight, he is in doubt also with regard to his defilement.","3511":"All persons become unclean through zivah, even converts, even slaves whether freed or not, a deaf-mute, a person of unsound senses, and a minor, a eunuch whether he had been castrated by man, or was a eunuch from the time of seeing the sun. With regard to a tumtum and an androgynous person, they place upon him the stringencies for a man and the stringencies for a woman: they defile through blood like a woman, and through eggy substance  like a man. Their uncleanness still remains in doubt.","3512":"There are seven ways in which a zav is examined as long as he had not become subject to zivah: With regard to food, drink, as to what he had carried, whether he had jumped, whether he had been ill, what he had seen, or what he had thought. It doesn't matter whether he had thoughts before seeing a woman, or whether he had seen a woman before his thoughts. Rabbi Judah says: even if he had watched beasts, wild animals or birds having intercourse with each other, and even when he had seen a woman's dyed garments. Rabbi Akiva says: even if he had eaten any kind of food, be it good or bad, or had drunk any kind of liquid. They said to him: Then there will be no zavim in the world!\u2019 He replied to them: you are not held responsible for the existence of zavim!\u2019 Once he had become subject to zivah, no further examination takes place. Zov resulting from an accident, or that was at all doubtful, or an issue of semen, these are unclean, since there are grounds for the assumption that it is zivah. If he had at a first issue they examine him; On the second issue they examine him, but on the third issue they don't examine him. Rabbi Eliezer says: even on the third issue they examine him because of the sacrifice.","3513":"One who had a discharge of semen does not defile due to zivah for a period of twenty-four hours. Rabbi Yose says: only that day. A non-Jew who had a discharge of semen and then converted, he immediately becomes unclean due to zivah. A woman who had an issue of blood, or had experienced difficulty in childbirth, the time prescribed is twenty-four hours. One who strikes his slave, the \"day or two\" is twenty-four hours. A dog that eats a corpse's flesh, for three days from one time of day to the same time of day, it is considered to be in its natural state.","3514":"A zav defiles the objects that are lain upon in five ways, so that they defile people and garments: by standing, sitting, lying, hanging or leaning. What he lies upon defiles a person in seven ways, so that he in turn defiles garments: by standing, sitting, lying, hanging, or leaning upon it, or by touching or carrying it.","3515":"A zav and a clean person who sat together in a boat, or on a raft, or rode together on a beast, even though their garments did not touch, behold they are impure through midras. If they sat together on a plank, on a bench or on a bed-frame, or on a beam, when these were not fixed tightly, Or if they had both climbed a weak tree, or were swaying on a weak branch of a strong tree; Or if they were both climbing on an Egyptian ladder which was not secured by a nail; Or if they sat together on a bridge, rafter or door, not secured by clay, they are unclean. Rabbi Judah says that they are clean.","3516":"If they were both closing or opening a door, the clean person and his clothes are unclean. But the sages say: he is not unclean unless one was shutting and the other opening it. If one was lifting the other out of a pit the clean person and his clothes are unclean. Rabbi Judah says: only if the clean person was pulling out the unclean one. If they were twisting ropes together the clean person and his clothes are unclean. But the sages say: unless the one pulled one way and the other pulled the other way. If they were both weaving together, whether they were standing or sitting, or grinding wheat, the clean person and his clothes are unclean. Rabbi Shimon says the clean person in every case is pure, except where they both were grinding with a hand-mill. If they both were unloading or loading a donkey, they are unclean if the load was heavy, but clean if the load was light. In all cases, however, they are clean for members of the synagogue, but are unclean for terumah.","3517":"If the zav and the clean person sat together in a large boat: (what is considered a large boat? Rabbi Judah said: one that does not sway with a man's weight), or if they sat on a plank, bench, bed-frame, or beam when these were firmly secured; Or if they both climbed a strong tree, a firm branch, or a Tyrian ladder, or an Egyptian ladder fixed by a nail; Or if they sat on a bridge, rafter or door, when these were fastened with clay, even if only at one end, they remain clean. If the clean one struck the unclean one, he still remains clean. But if the unclean one struck the clean one, he is impure; for in that case if the clean one drew back, the unclean one would have fallen.","3518":"Rabbi Joshua said: if a menstruant sat in a bed with a clean woman, even the cap on her head contracts midras uncleanness. And if she sat in a boat, the vessels on the top of the mast also contract midras uncleanness. If there was on the boat a tub full of clothes: If their weight was heavy, they become unclean, But if their weight was light, they remain clean. If a zav knocked against a balcony and thereby caused a loaf of terumah to fall down, it remains clean.","3519":"If he knocked against a strong beam, a window-frame, water-pipe, a shelf, even though it was fixed with ropes, or an oven, a flour container, the lower mill-stone, the base of a hand-mill, or the se'ah measure  of an olive-grinder, the loaf remains clean. Rabbi Yose adds: also if he knocks against the beam of the bath-keeper, it remains clean.","3520":"If he knocked against a door, doorbolt, lock, oar, mill basket,   or against a weak tree, or weak branch of a strong tree, or against an Egyptian ladder unsecured by nails, or against a bridge, beam or door, not made secure with clay, they become unclean. If he knocked against a chest, box or cupboard, they become unclean. Rabbi Nehemiah and Rabbi Shimon declare them clean in these cases.","3521":"A zav who lays across five benches, or five money-belts: If lengthwise, he makes them unclean; But breadthwise, they are clean. If he slept on them,   and it was doubful that he had turned over onto them, they are unclean. If he was lying on six seats, with two hands on two seats, two feet on another two, his head on one, with his body on another one, only that one on which his body lay   is rendered unclean. If a zav stood on two seats: Rabbi Shimon says: if these were distant one from the other, they remain clean.","3522":"Ten cloaks one on top of the other, if he sat on the uppermost one, all are unclean. A zav who was on one scale of a balance and in the other scale opposite there were objects fit to sit or lie upon: If the zav pushed them up, they are clean. But if they pushed him up, they are unclean. Rabbi Shimon says:   if there was one object it becomes unclean, but if there were many   they remain clean, since none of them had borne the greater part of the zav's weight.","3523":"If a zav sat in one scale of the balance, while food and liquids were in the other scale, the latter become unclean. In the case of a corpse, everything remains clean except for a man. This is an example of the greater stringency applying to a zav than to a corpse; and there is a greater stringency in the case of a corpse than a zav. For whereas the zav defiles all objects on which he sits or lies upon, so that these likewise convey uncleanness to people and garments, and he conveys to what is above him madaf uncleanness, so that these in turn defile food and liquids. Whereas in the case of a corpse no such uncleanness is conveyed. Greater stringency is also found in the case of a corpse, since it can convey uncleanness by overshadowing, and it defiles seven days\u2019 defilement, whereas in the case of a zav no such uncleanness is conveyed.","3524":"If he sat on a bed and there were four cloaks under the four legs of the bed, all become unclean, since the bed cannot stand on three legs; But Rabbi Shimon declares them clean. If he rode on a beast and there were four cloaks under the legs of the beast, they are clean, since the beast can stand upon three legs. If there was one cloak under its two forelegs or its two hindlegs, or under a foreleg and a hindleg, it becomes unclean. Rabbi Yose says: a horse conveys uncleanness through its hindlegs and a donkey through its forelegs, since a horse leans upon its hindlegs and a donkey upon its forelegs. If he sat on a beam of an olive-press, the vessels in the olive-press receptacle are unclean. If he sat on a clothing press, the garments beneath it are clean. Rabbi Nehemiah declares them unclean.","3525":"One who touches a zav, or whom a zav touches, who moves  a zav or whom a zav moves, defiles by contact food and liquids and vessels that are rinsed, but not by carrying. A general principle was stated by Rabbi Joshua: anyone that defile garments  while still in contact with their source of uncleanness also defiles foods and liquids so as to become unclean in the first grade, and the hands  so that they become unclean in the second grade; but they do not defile people or earthenware vessels. After they separated from their source of uncleanness they defile liquids so as to become unclean in the first grade, and food and the hands so that they become unclean in the second grade, but they do not defile garments.","3526":"They said yet another general principle: All that is carried above a zav becomes defiled, but all those things above which he is carried are clean except objects on which he can sit or lie upon, and a person. How so? If a zav had his finger beneath a layer of stones and one that was clean was above, he conveys uncleanness at two degrees of remove and disqualifies terumah at one further remove. If he separated from the source of uncleanness he still defiles at one remove and disqualifies terumah at yet one further remove. If the unclean one was above, and the clean person below, he defiles at two removes, and disqualifies terumah at yet one further remove. If he separated from the source of uncleanness, he defiles at one remove and disqualifies terumah at yet one more remove. If foods or liquids, or objects on which he could sit or lie upon or other articles were above, they defile at one remove, and disqualify terumah at one further remove. If they had become separated from the source of uncleanness, they defile at one remove and disqualify terumah at one more remove. All objects fit to sit or lie upon that were below defile at two removes, and disqualify terumah at one more remove. If they had become separate from the source of uncleanness, they defile at two removes and disqualify terumah at one more remove Foods and liquids and other articles that are below, remain clean.","3527":"Whatever carries or is carried by objects on which one sits or lies upon remain clean, except for a person. Whatever carries or is carried by carrion is clean, except for one that shifts it. Rabbi Eliezer says: also one that carries it. Whatever carries or is carried upon a corpse remains clean, except for one that overshadows, or a person when he shifts it.","3528":"If part of an unclean person rests upon a clean person, or part of a clean person upon an unclean person, or if things connected to an unclean person rest upon a clean person, or if things connected to a clean person upon one unclean, he becomes unclean. Rabbi Shimon says: if part of an unclean person is upon a clean person, he is unclean;   but if part of a clean person is upon one that is unclean, he is clean.","3529":"If an unclean person rests upon part of an object fit to lie upon, or a clean person   rests upon part of an object fit to lie upon, it becomes unclean. If part of an unclean person rests on an object fit to lie upon, or part of a clean person rests upon an object fit to lie upon, it remains clean. Thus we find that impurity enters it and goes out of it by its lesser part. Similarly, if a loaf of terumah was placed upon an object fit to lie upon that was unclean and there paper in between, whether it was above or below, it remains clean. Similarly, in the case of a stone with scale disease it remains clean. Rabbi Shimon pronounced such a case unclean.","3530":"He who touches a zav, or a zavah, a menstruant, or a woman after childbirth, or a metzora, or any object on which these had been sitting or lying, conveys uncleanness at two removes and disqualifies terumah at one further remove. If he separated, he still conveys uncleanness at one remove, and disqualifies terumah at one further remove. This is true whether he had touched, or had shifted, or had carried, or was carried.","3531":"If one touches the discharge of a zav, his spittle, semen or urine, or the blood of a menstruant, he conveys uncleanness at two removes, and disqualifies terumah at one more remove; If he separated,   he defiles at one remove and disqualifies terumah at one more remove. This is the case whether he had touched or moved it. Rabbi Eliezer said: also if he had carried it.","3532":"If he carried something which was ridden upon, or if he was carried on it, or he had shifted it, he defiles at two removes, and disqualifies terumah at one more remove; But if he became separated from the uncleanness, he defiles at one remove and disqualifies terumah at one more remove. If he carried nevelah (carrion), or the hatat waters sufficient for a sprinkling, he defiles at two removes, and disqualifies terumah at one more remove; But if he became separated, ,he defiles at one remove and disqualifies terumah at one more remove.","3533":"He who ate nevelah of a clean bird, and it still is in his gullet, defiles at two removes, and disqualifies terumah at one more remove. If he put his head within the air-space of an oven, the oven remains clean. But if he vomited or swallowed it, he defiles at one remove and disqualifies terumah unfit at one more remove. But as long as it is still in his mouth, until he swallows it, he remains clean.","3534":"He who touches a dead sheretz, or semen, or he that has suffered corpse uncleanness, or a metzora during his days of counting,  or hatat waters of insufficient quantity with which to perform the sprinkling,  or carrion, or an object ridden upon by a zav, defiles at one remove and disqualifies terumah at one more remove. This is the general principle: anyone who touches anything that according to the Torah is a \"father of uncleanness\" defiles at one remove and disqualifies terumah at one more remove, except for the corpse of a human. If he had become separated, he defiles at one remove and renders terumah unfit at one more remove.","3535":"He who has had a seminal emission is like one who has touched a dead sheretz. And one who has had sex with a menstruant is like one who has suffered corpse uncleanness. But one who has had sex with a menstruant is more stringent in that he conveys minor grades of uncleanness to what he lies or sits upon, so as to make foods and liquids unclean.","3536":"The following disqualify terumah:One who eats foods with first degree uncleanness; Or one who eats food with second degree uncleanness; And who drinks unclean liquids. And the one who has immersed his head and the greater part of him in drawn water; And a clean person upon whose head and greater part of him there fell three logs of drawn water; And a scroll of Holy Scriptures, And unwashed hands; And one that has had immersion that same day; And foods and vessels which have become defiled by liquids.","3537":"From what time may one recite the Shema in the evening? From the time that the priests enter their houses in order to eat their terumah until the end of the first watch, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. The sages say: until midnight. Rabban Gamaliel says: until dawn. Once it happened that his sons came home late from a wedding feast and they said to him: we have not yet recited the evening Shema. He said to them: if it is not yet dawn you are still obligated to recite. And not in respect to this alone did they so decide, but wherever the sages say \u201cuntil midnight,\u201d the mitzvah may be performed until dawn. The burning of the fat and the pieces may be performed till dawn. Similarly, all the offerings that are to be eaten within one day may be eaten till dawn. Why then did the sages say \u201cuntil midnight\u201d?  In order to keep a man far from transgression.","3538":"From what time may one recite the Shema in the morning? From the time that one can distinguish between blue and white. Rabbi Eliezer says: between blue and green. And he must finish it by sunrise. Rabbi Joshua says: until the third hour of the day, for such is the custom of the children of kings, to rise at the third hour. If one recites the Shema later he loses nothing, like one who reads in the Torah.","3539":"Bet Shammai say: in the evening every man should recline and recite the Shema, and in the morning he should stand, as it says, \u201cAnd when you lie down and when you get up\u201d (Deuteronomy 6:7). Bet Hillel say that every man should recite in his own way, as it says, \u201cAnd when you walk by the way\u201d (ibid).  Why then is it said, \u201cAnd when you lies down and when you get up?\u201d At the time when people lie down and at the time when people rise up. Rabbi Tarfon said: I was once walking by the way and I reclined to recite the Shema according to the words of Bet Shammai, and I incurred danger from robbers. They said to him: you deserved to come to harm, because you acted against the words of Bet Hillel.","3540":"In the morning he recites two blessings before it and one after it; in the evening two before it and two after it, one long and one short. Where they the sages said that a long one should be said, he may not say a short one; where they said a short one he may not say a long one Where they said to conclude with a blessing he is not permitted to not conclude; where they said to not conclude with a blessing, he may not conclude.","3541":"They mention the Exodus from Egypt at night. Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah said: \"Behold, I am almost a seventy-year old man and I have not succeeded in understanding why the Exodus from Egypt should be mentioned at night, until Ben Zoma explained it from a verse (Deuteronomy 16:3): \u2018In order that you may remember the day you left Egypt all the days of your life.\u2019 \u2018The days of your life\u2019 refers to the days.  \u2018All the days of your life\u2019 refers to the nights. And the sages say: \u2018the days of your life\u2019 refers to this world.  \u2018All the days of your life\u2019 includes the days of the Messiah.","3542":"If one was reading in the Torah the section of the Shema and the time for its recital arrived, if he directed his heart to fulfill the mitzvah he has fulfilled his obligation, but if not he has not fulfilled his obligation. In the breaks between sections one may give greeting out of respect and return greeting; in the middle of a section one may give greeting out of fear and return it, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: in the middle one may give greeting out of fear and return it out of respect, in the breaks one may give greeting out of respect and return greeting to anyone.","3543":"These are the breaks between the sections: between the first blessing and the second,   between the second and \u201cShema,\u201d between \u201cShema\u201d and \u201cAnd it shall come to pass if you listen\u201d between \u201cAnd it shall come to pass if you listen\u201d and \u201cAnd the Lord said\u201d and between \u201cAnd the Lord said\u201d and \u201cEmet veYatziv\u201d (true and firm). Rabbi Judah says: between \u201cAnd the Lord said\u201d and \u201cEmet veYatziv\u201d one should not interrupt. Rabbi Joshua ben Korhah said: Why was the section of \u201cShema\u201d placed before that of \u201cAnd it shall come to pass if you listen\u201d? So that one should first accept upon himself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven and then take upon himself the yoke of the commandments. Why does the section of \u201cAnd it shall come to pass if you listen\u201d come before that of \u201cAnd the Lord said\u201d? Because \u201cAnd it shall come to pass if you listen\u201d is customary during both day and night,   whereas the section \u201cAnd the Lord said\u201d is customary only during the day.","3544":"One who recites the Shema without causing it to be heard by his own ear, he has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Yose says: he has not fulfilled his obligation. If he recited it without pronouncing the letters succinctly, Rabbi Yose says he has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Judah says: he has not fulfilled his obligation. If he recites it out of order, he has not fulfilled his obligation. If he recites it and makes a mistake he goes back to the place where he made the mistake.","3545":"Workers may recite the Shema on the top of a tree or the top of a scaffolding, that which they are not allowed to do in the case of the Tefillah.","3546":"A bridegroom is exempt from reciting the Shema on the first night until the end of the Shabbat, if he has not performed the act. It happened with Rabban Gamaliel who recited the Shema on the first night after he had married.  His students said to him: Our master, have you not taught us that a bridegroom is exempt from reciting the Shema. He replied to them: I will not listen to you to remove from myself the Kingship of Heaven even for a moment.","3547":"Rabban Gamaliel bathed on the first night after the death of his wife. His disciples said to him: Master, have you not taught us, that a mourner is forbidden to bathe. He replied to them: I am not like other men, I am very delicate.","3548":"When Tabi his Rabban Gamaliel\u2019s slave died he accepted condolences for him. His disciples said to him: Master, have you not taught us that one does not accept condolences for slaves? He replied to them: My slave Tabi was not like other slaves: he was a fit man.","3549":"If a bridegroom wants to recite the Shema on the first night of his marriage, he may do so. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: not everyone who desires to take up the name of God may do so.","3550":"One whose dead relative lies before him is exempt from the recital of the Shema and from the tefillah and from tefillin. The bearers of the bier and their replacements, and their replacements\u2019 replacement, both those in front of the bier and those behind the bier those needed to carry the bier, are exempt; but those not needed to carry the bier are obligated. Both, however, are exempt from saying the tefillah.","3551":"When they have buried the dead and returned from the grave, if they have time to begin and finish the Shema before they get to the row, they should begin, but if not they should not begin. Those who stand in the row, those on the inside are exempt, but those on the outside are obligated.","3552":"Women, slaves and minors are exempt from reciting the Shema and putting on tefillin, but are obligated for tefillah, mezuzah, and Birkat Hamazon (the blessing after meals).","3553":"One who has had a seminal emission utters the words of the Shema in his heart and he doesn\u2019t say a blessing, neither before nor after. Over food he says a blessing afterwards, but not the blessing before. Rabbi Judah says: he blesses both before them and after them.","3554":"If a man was standing saying the tefillah and he remembers that he is one who has had a seminal emission, he should not stop but he should abbreviate the blessings. If he went down to immerse, if he is able to come up and cover himself and recite the Shema before the rising of the sun, he should go up and cover himself and recite, but if not he should cover himself with the water and recite. He should not cover himself either with foul water or with steeping water until he pours fresh water into it. How far should he remove himself from it and from excrement? Four cubits.","3555":"A zav who has had a seminal emission and a niddah from whom semen escapes and a woman who becomes niddah during intercourse require a mikveh. Rabbi Judah exempts them.","3556":"The morning Tefillah is until midday. Rabbi Judah says until the fourth hour. The afternoon Tefillah until evening. Rabbi Judah says: until the middle of the afternoon. The evening prayer has no fixed time. The time for the additional prayers is the whole day. Rabbi Judah says:  until the seventh hour.","3557":"Rabbi Nehunia ben Hakaneh used to pray as he entered the Bet Hamidrash and as he left it a short prayer. They said to him: what is the reason for this prayer? He replied: When I enter I pray that that no mishap should occur through me, and when I leave I express thanks for my portion.","3558":"Rabban Gamaliel says: every day a man should pray the eighteen blessings. Rabbi Joshua says: an abstract of the eighteen. Rabbi Akiva says: if he knows it fluently he prays the eighteen, and if not an abstract of the eighteen.","3559":"Rabbi Eliezer says: if a man makes his prayers fixed, it is not true supplication. Rabbi Joshua says: if one is traveling in a dangerous place, he says a short prayer, saying: Save, O Lord, Your people the remnant of Israel.  In every time of crisis may their needs be before You. Blessed are You, O Lord, who hears prayer.","3560":"If he is riding on a donkey, he gets down and prays. If he is unable to get down he should turn his face towards Jerusalem, and if he cannot turn his face, he should direct his heart to the Holy of Holies.","3561":"If he is traveling in a ship, on a wagon or on a raft, he should  direct his heart toward the Holy of Holies.","3562":"Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah says: The musaf prayer is said only with the local congregation. The sages say: whether with or with out the congregation. Rabbi Judah said in his name: wherever there is a congregation, an individual is exempt from saying the musaf prayer.","3563":"One should not stand up to say Tefillah except in a reverent state of mind. The pious men of old used to wait an hour before praying in order that they might direct their thoughts to God. Even if a king greets him while praying he should not answer him: even if a snake is wound round his heel he should not stop.","3564":"They mention God\u2019s power to bring rain in the blessing for the resurrection of the dead. And they ask for rain in the blessing for fruitful years. And havdalah in \u201cWho grant knowledge.\u201d Rabbi Akiva says: he says it as a fourth blessing by itself. Rabbi Eliezer says: in the thanksgiving blessing.","3565":"The one who says, \u201cOn a bird\u2019s nest may Your mercy be extended,\u201d or \u201cFor good may Your name be blessed\u201d or \u201cWe give thanks, we give thanks,\u201d they silence him. One who was passing before the ark and made a mistake, another should pass in his place, and he should not be as one who refuses at that moment. Where does he begin? At the beginning of the blessing in which the other made a mistake.","3566":"The one who passes before the ark should not respond Amen after the blessings of the priests because this might confuse him. If there is no priest there except himself, he should not raise his hands to recite the priestly blessing, but if he is confident that he can raise his hands and go back to his place in his prayer, he is permitted to do so.","3567":"One who is praying and makes a mistake, it is a bad sign for him. And if he is the messenger of the congregation it is a bad sign for those who have sent him, because one\u2019s messenger is equivalent to one\u2019s self. They said about Rabbi Hanina ben Dosa that he used to pray for the sick and say, \u201cThis one will die, this one will live.\u201d They said to him: \u201cHow do you know?\u201d He replied: \u201cIf my prayer comes out fluently, I know that he is accepted, but if not, then I know that he is rejected.\u201d","3568":"How do they bless over produce? Over fruit of the tree one says, \u201cWho creates the fruit of the tree,\u201d except for wine, over which one says, \u201cWho creates the fruit of the vine.\u201d Over produce from the ground one says: \u201cWho creates the fruit of the ground,\u201d except over bread, over which one says, \u201cWho brings forth bread from the earth.\u201d Over vegetables one says, \u201cWho creates the fruit of the ground.\u201d Rabbi Judah says: \u201cWho creates diverse species of herbs.\u201d","3569":"If one blessed over fruit of the tree the blessing, \u201cWho creates the fruit of the ground,\u201d he has fulfilled his obligation. But if he said over produce from the ground, \u201cWho creates the fruit of the tree,\u201d he has not fulfilled his obligation. If over anything he says \u201cBy Whose word all things exist\u201d, he has fulfilled his obligation.","3570":"Over anything which does not grow from the earth one says: \u201cBy Whose word all things exist.\u201d Over vinegar, fallen unripe fruit and locusts one says, \u201cBy Whose word all things exist.\u201d Over milk and cheese and eggs one says, \u201cBy Whose word all things exist.\u201d  R. Judah says: over anything which is cursed they do not bless at all.","3571":"There were several kinds of food before him: Rabbi Judah says that if there is among them one of the seven species, he blesses over that. But the sages say: he may bless over which ever one he wants.","3572":"If he blessed over the wine before the meal he has exempted the wine after the meal. If he blessed over the appetizer before the meal, he has exempted the dessert after the meal. If he blessed over the bread he has exempted the appetizer\/dessert he has not exempted the bread. Bet Shammai say: he has not even exempted a cooked grain dish.","3573":"If those at the table are sitting upright, each one blesses for himself. If they are reclining, one blesses for them all. If wine came during the meal, each one says a blessing for himself. If after the meal, one blesses for them all. The same one says the blessing over the incense, even though the incense is not brought until after the meal.","3574":"If they brought in front of him salted food at the beginning of the meal and bread with it, he blesses over the salted food and thereby exempts the bread, since the bread is ancillary to it. This is the general principle: whenever there is one kind of food that is the main food and another that is ancillary, he blesses over the main food and thereby exempts the ancillary.","3575":"If one has eaten grapes, figs or pomegranates he blesses after them three blessings, the words of Rabban Gamaliel. The sages say: one blessing which includes three. Rabbi Akiva says: even if one ate only boiled vegetables and that is his meal, he says after it the three blessings. If one drinks water to quench his thirst, he says \u201cBy Whose word all things exist.\u201d Rabbi Tarfon says: \u201cWho creates many living things and their requirements.\u201d","3576":"Three that have eaten together, it is their duty to invite one another to say Birkat Hamazon. One who ate demai, or first tithe whose terumah has been separated, or second tithe or sanctified property which have been redeemed, or an attendant who has eaten as much as an olive\u2019s worth of food, or a Samaritan may be included in the three. But one who ate untithed produce, or first tithe whose terumah has not been separated, or second tithe or sanctified property which have not been redeemed, or an attendant who has eaten less than the quantity of an olive or a Gentile may not be counted.","3577":"Women, children and slaves they do not recite an invitation over them. How much must one have eaten in order for them to recite an invitation? As much as an olive. Rabbi Judah says:  as much as an egg.","3578":"How do they invite one another to recite the Birkat Hamazon?If there are three, he the one saying Birkat Hamazon says, \u201cLet us bless Him of whose food we have eaten.\u201d If there are three and him he says, \u201cBless Him of whose food we have eaten\u201d If there are ten, he says, \u201cLet us bless our God of whose food we have eaten.\u201d If there are ten and he says, \u201cBless.\u201d It is the same whether there are ten or ten myriads (ten ten thousands). If there are a hundred he says, \u201cLet us bless the Lord our God of whose food we have eaten. If there are a hundred and him he says, \u201cBless.\u201d If there are a thousand he says \u201cLet us bless the Lord our God, the God of Israel of whose food we have eaten.\u201d If there are a thousand and him he says \u201cBless.\u201d If there are ten thousand he says, \u201cLet us bless the Lord our God, the God of Israel, the God of hosts, who dwells among the cherubim, for the food which we have eaten.\u201d If there are ten thousand and him he says, \u201cBless.\u201d Corresponding to his blessing the others answer after him, \u201cBlessed be the Lord our God the God of Israel, the God of hosts, who dwells among the cherubim, for the food which we have eaten.\u201d Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: According to the number of the congregation, they bless, as it says, \u201cIn assemblies bless God, the Lord, O you who are from the fountain of Israel.\u201d Rabbi Akiba said: What do we find in the synagogue? Whether there are many or few the he says, \u201cBless the Lord your God.\u201d Rabbi Ishmael says: \u201cBless the Lord your God who is blessed.\u201d","3579":"Three persons who have eaten together may not separate to recite Birkat Hamazon. Similarly four and similarly five. Six may separate, up until ten. And ten may not separate until there are twenty.","3580":"Two eating companies that were eating in the same room: When some of them can see some of the other they combine for a zimun, but if not each group makes a zimun for itself. They do not bless over the wine until they put water into it, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. The sages say they bless.","3581":"These are the points of difference between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel in regard to a meal. Bet Shammai says:  first he blesses over the day and then over the wine. Bet Hillel says:  first he blesses over the wine and then over the day.","3582":"Bet Shammai says:  they wash their hands and then they pour the cup of wine. Bet Hillel says: they pour the cup of wine and then they wash their hands.","3583":"Bet Shammai says: he wipes his hand with a towel and then places it on the table. Bet Hillel says: on the cushion.","3584":"Bet Shammai says: after the meal they sweep the floor and then they wash their hands. But Bet Hillel says: they wash their hands and then they sweep the floor.","3585":"Bet Shammai says: the proper order is candle, Birkat HaMazon, spices, and Havdalah. But Bet Hillel says: candle, spices, Birkat HaMazon, and Havdalah. Bet Shammai says the blessing over the candle concludes with the words, \u201cWho created the light of the fire.\u201d But Bet Hillel says: \u201cWho creates the lights of the fire.\u201d","3586":"They do not bless over the candles or the spices of non-Jews; Or over the candles or the spices of the dead; Or over the candles or the spices of idolatry; And a blessing is not said over the light until they benefit from its light.","3587":"One who has eaten and forgotten to bless Birkat Hamazon: Bet Shammai says: he must return to the place where he ate and bless. But Bet Hillel says:  he should say it in the place where he remembered. Until when can he bless? Until sufficient time has passed for the food in his stomach to be digested.","3588":"If wine comes to them after the food, and there is only that cup: Bet Shammai says: he blesses over the wine and then he blesses over the food; But Bet Hillel says: he blesses over the food and then he blesses over the wine. They answer amen after a blessing said by an Israelite but they do not answer amen after a blessing said by a Samaritan, until he hears the whole blessing.","3589":"If one sees a place where miracles have been done for Israel, he says, \u201cBlessed be the One who made miracles for our ancestors in this place.\u201d If one sees a place from which idolatry has been uprooted, he should say, \u201cBlessed be the One who removed idolatry from our land.\u201d","3590":"On witnessing comets, earthquakes, thunder, or windy storms one says, \u201cBlessed be He whose strength and might fill the world.\u201d On seeing mountains, hills, seas, rivers or deserts one says, \u201cBlessed be He who made creation.\u201d Rabbi Judah says: one who sees the Great Sea should say, \u201cBlessed be He who made the Great Sea,\u201d if he sees it at intervals. For rain and for good news one says, \u201cBlessed be He that is good and grants good.\u201d For bad news one says, \u201cBlessed be the true judge.\u201d","3591":"One who has built a new house or bought new vessels says, \u201cBlessed be He who has kept us alive and preserved us and brought us to this season.\u201d One who blesses over the evil as he blesses over the good or over the good as he blesses over evil; one who cries over the past, behold this is a vain prayer. How so?  If his wife was pregnant and he says, \u201cMay it be his will that my wife bear a male child,\u201d this is a vain prayer. If he is coming home from a journey and he hears a cry of distress in the town and says, \u201cMay it be his will that this is not be those of my house,\u201d this is a vain prayer.","3592":"One who enters into a large city should say two prayers, one on entering and one on leaving. Ben Azzai says: four two on entering and two on leaving, he gives thanks for the past and cries out for the future.","3593":"One must bless God for the evil in the same way as one blesses for the good, as it says, \u201cAnd you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might\u201d (Deuteronomy 6:5). \u201cWith all your heart,\u201d with your two impulses, the evil impulse as well as the good impulse. \u201cWith all your soul\u201d even though he takes your soul life away from you. \u201cWith all your might\u201d with all your money. Another explanation, \u201cWith all your might\u201d  whatever treatment he metes out to you. One should not show disrespect to the Eastern Gate, because it is in a direct line with the Holy of Holies. One should not enter the Temple Mount with a staff, or with shoes on, or with a wallet, or with dusty feet; nor should one make it a short cut, all the more spitting is forbidden. All the conclusions of blessings that were in the Temple they would say, \u201cforever lit. as long as the world is.\u201d When the sectarians perverted their ways and said that there was only one world, they decreed that they should say, \u201cfor ever and ever lit. from the end of the world to the end of the world. They also decreed that a person should greet his fellow in God\u2019s name, as it says, \u201cAnd behold Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, \u2018May the Lord be with you.\u2019 And they answered him, \u201cMay the Lord bless you\u2019\u201d (Ruth 2:. And it also says, \u201cThe Lord is with you, you valiant warrior\u201d (Judges 6:12). And it also says, \u201cAnd do not despise your mother when she grows old\u201d (Proverbs 23:22). And it also says, \u201cIt is time to act on behalf of the Lord, for they have violated Your teaching\u201d (Psalms 119:126). Rabbi Natan says: this means \u201cThey have violated your teaching It is time to act on behalf of the Lord.\u201d","3594":"There are some who bring bikkurim and recite the declaration; others who only bring, but do not recite; and there are some who neither bring nor recite.The following are those that do not bring: one who plants a vine on his own property, but buries a shoot in the ground so that it grows on property belonging to another individual or to the public. And similarly if one buries a shoot in the ground of another person\u2019s private property or in public property, so that it grows on his own property; Or, if one plants a vine on his own property and buries it in the ground so that it still grows on his own property, but there is a private or public road between, such a one does not bring bikkurim. Rabbi Judah says: such a one has to bring bikkurim.","3595":"For what reason may he not bring them? Because it is said, \u201cThe first-fruits of your land\u201d until all of their growth is on your land. Sharecroppers, leasers, or occupiers of confiscated property (sikarikon), or a robber does not bring them for the same reason, because it says, \u201cThe first-fruits of your land.\u201d","3596":"Bikkurim are brought only from the seven species. Not from dates grown on hills, nor from the other species grown in the valley, nor from olives that are not choice. Bikkurim are not to be brought before Shavuot. The people from Mt. Zevoim brought bikkurim prior to Atzeret (Shavuot), but they did not accept from them, on for it is written in the Torah: \u201cAnd the festival of the harvest, the first-fruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field\u201d (Exodus 23:16).","3597":"These bring bikkurim but do not read the declaration:The convert, since he cannot say: \u201cWhich the Lord has sworn to our fathers, to give to us\u201d (Deuteronomy 26:3). If his mother was an Israelite, then he brings bikkurim and recites. When he prays privately, he says: \u201cGod of the fathers of Israel,\u201d but when he is in the synagogue, he should say: \u201cThe God of your fathers.\u201d But if his mother was an Israelite, he says: \u201cThe God of our fathers\u2019.","3598":"Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: a woman who is a daughter of a convert may not marry a priest unless her mother was herself an Israelite. This law applies equally to the offspring whether of proselytes or freed slaves, even to ten generations, unless their mother is an Israelite. A guardian, an agent, a slave, a woman, one of doubtful sex, or a hermaphrodite bring the bikkurim, but do not recite, since they cannot say: \u201cWhich you, O Lord, have given to me\u201d (Deuteronomy 26:10).","3599":"One who buys two trees that had grown in property belonging to his fellow brings bikkurim but does not recite the declaration. Rabbi Meir says: he brings and recites. If the well dried up, or the tree was cut down, he brings but does not recite. Rabbi Judah says: he brings and recites. From Atzeret until the Festival he brings and recites. From the Festival and until Hannukah he brings, but does not recite. Rabbi Judah ben Batera says: he brings and recites.","3600":"If one set aside his bikkurim and afterwards sold his field, he brings but does not recite. The second one who bought the field does not bring bikkurim of the same species, but of another species he brings and recites. Rabbi Judah says: he may also bring of the same kind and recite.","3601":"If one set aside his bikkurim and they were robbed, or rotted, were stolen or lost, or became unclean, he must bring others in their place, but does not recite the declaration. These others are not subject to the law of the added fifth. If they become unclean while in the Temple court, he must scatter them and he does not recite.","3602":"From where do we know that one is responsible for his bikkurim until he brings them to the temple Mount? Because it says: \u201cThe first of the first-fruits of your land you shall bring into the house of the Lord your God\u201d this teaches that he is responsible until he brings them to the Temple Mount. If he brought bikkurim of one kind and made the recital and then brought of another kind, he does not make a second recital.","3603":"These bring and recite:One who brings bikkurim from Atzeret until the Festival of Sukkot, from the seven species, from fruit grown on the mountains, or dates grown in the valleys, from oil-olives, and from produce from the other side of the Jordan. Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: one does not bring bikkurim from transjordania, since that is not a land flowing with milk and honey.","3604":"One who bought three trees in another\u2019s field, he brings bikkurim and recites. Rabbi Meir says: even if he bought only two. If he bought one tree with its land, he brings bikkurim and recites. Rabbi Judah says: even sharecroppers and leasers bring and recite.","3605":"Regarding terumah and bikkurim:One is liable to death And the additional fifth; And they are forbidden to non-priests; And they are the property of the priest; And they are neutralized in a hundred and one parts; And they require the washing of hands; And the setting of the sun. These laws apply only to terumah and bikkurim, but not to tithe.","3606":"There are laws which apply to second tithe and bikkurim but not to terumah:That second tithe and bikkurim must to be brought to the appointed place; They require confession; They are forbidden to an onen. But Rabbi Shimon permits bikkurim to an onen; They are subject to the law of removal. But Rabbi Shimon exempts bikkurim from removal. And in Jerusalem the slightest mixture of them with hullin of the same species renders it forbidden to be consumed as common food outside of Jerusalem. And what grows from them in Jerusalem is forbidden to be consumed outside of Jerusalem, Even by non-priests or by cattle; But Rabbi Shimon permits. These are the laws which apply to second tithe and bikkurim, but not to terumah.","3607":"There are laws which apply to terumah and maaser sheni but not to bikkurim:Terumah and the second tithe render forbidden the contents of the threshing-floor; They have a set amount. They apply to all produce; Both during and after Temple times; And they apply to to produce grown by sharecroppers, leasers, or occupiers of confiscated property (sikarikon), or a robber. These are the laws which apply to terumah and maaser sheni, but not to bikkurim.","3608":"And there are laws which apply to bikkurim which do not apply to terumah or maaser sheni:For bikkurim can become acquired while still attached to the soil. And a man may make his entire field bikkurim; He is responsible for them; And they require a sacrifice, a song, waving and spending the night in Jerusalem.","3609":"The terumah of tithe is like bikkurim in two ways, and like terumah in two other ways:It may be taken from pure produce for impure produce; And from such produce that is not in close proximity, like bikkurim. And it renders the contents of the threshing-floor forbidden, And it has a prescribed amount like terumah.","3610":"An etrog is similar in three ways to the fruit of an ordinary tree, and in one way to a vegetable. It is similar to a tree in respect of orlah, fourth year plantings, and the law of the seventh year; And it is similar to a vegetable in one thing: that its tithing goes according to the time it is harvested, the words of Rabban Gamaliel. Rabbi Eliezer says: it is similar to a tree in all ways.","3611":"The blood of those who walk on two legs is like the blood of beasts in that it renders seeds susceptible to impurity. And it is like the blood of a sheretz, in that one is not liable for eating it.","3612":"A koy is in some ways like a wild animal (hayyah); in some ways it is like a domesticated animal (behemah); in some ways it is like both a behemah and a hayyah, and in some ways it is like neither a behemah nor a hayyah.","3613":"How is it like a wild animal?Its blood must be covered like the blood of a wild animal. It may not be slaughtered on a festival. If he slaughtered it, he should not cover its blood. Its fat is impure like that of a wild animal, but its impurity is of doubtful status. One does not redeem with it the first-born of a donkey.","3614":"And how is the koy similar to a behemah is prohibited like the fat of a behemah, but one who eats it is not liable for karet. It may not be bought with the money from second tithe to be eaten in Jerusalem. It is subject to the priest\u2019s share of the shoulder, the two cheeks and the maw. Rabbi Eliezer exempts it because the burden of proof is upon the one who extracts from his neighbor.","3615":"And how is a koy neither like a behemah nor like a hayyah?It is forbidden because of kilayim to yoke it with either a behemah or a hayyah. One who deeds his son his behemah and his hayyah he has not thereby given him the koy. If one says, \u201cI will become a nazirite if this is not a hayyah or a behemah\u201d, he is a nazirite. In all other ways it is like a behemah and a hayyah: It requires slaughtering like them both; It carries carrion impurity; And to it applies the law relating to a limb of a living being   like them both.","3616":"How does one set aside bikkurim? A man goes down into his field, he sees a fig that ripened, or a cluster of grapes that ripened, or a pomegranate that ripened, he ties a reed-rope around it and says: \u201cLet these be bikkurim.\u201d Rabbi Shimon says: even so, he must again designate them as bikkurim after they have been plucked from the soil.","3617":"How were the bikkurim taken up to Jerusalem?  All the inhabitants of the cities of the maamad would assemble in the city of the maamad, and they would spend the night in the open street and they would not entering any of the houses. Early in the morning the officer would say: \u201cLet us arise and go up to Zion, into the house of the Lord our God\u201d (Jeremiah 31:5).","3618":"Those who lived near Jerusalem would bring fresh figs and grapes, while those who lived far away would bring dried figs and raisins. An ox would go in front of them, his horns bedecked with gold and with an olive-crown on its head. The flute would play before them until they would draw close to Jerusalem. When they drew close to Jerusalem they would send messengers in advance, and they would adorn their bikkurim. The governors and chiefs and treasurers of the Temple would go out to greet them, and according to the rank of the entrants they would go forth. All the skilled artisans of Jerusalem would stand up before them and greet them saying, \u201cOur brothers, men of such and such a place, we welcome you in peace.\u201d","3619":"The flute would play before them, until they reached the Temple Mount. When they reached the Temple Mount even King Agrippas would take the basket and place it on his shoulder and walk as far as the Temple Court.

He then deposits the basket by the side of the altar, bow and depart.","3622":"Originally all who knew how to recite would recite while those who did not know how to recite, others would read it for them and they would repeat the words. But when they refrained from bringing, they decreed that they should read the words to both those who could and those who could not recite so that they could repeat after them.","3623":"The rich would bring their bikkurim in baskets overlaid with silver or gold, while the poor used wicker-baskets of peeled willow-branches, and the baskets and the bikkurim were given to the priest.","3624":"Rabbi Shimon ben Nanas says: they would decorate the bikkurim with produce other than the seven species. But Rabbi Akiva says: they may decorate only with produce of the seven kinds.","3625":"Rabbi Shimon says:  there are three elements in bikkurim: the bikkurim, the additions   to the bikkurim, and the ornamentations of the bikkurim. The additions to the bikkurim must be of a like kind; But the ornamentations can be of a different kind. The additions to the bikkurim can only be eaten in purity, and are exempt from demai. But the ornamentations of the bikkurim are subject to demai.","3626":"When did they say that the additions to the bikkurim are like bikkurim themselves? When they come from the land of Israel; but if they do not come from the land, they were not regarded as bikkurim themselves.","3627":"In what respect did they say that bikkurim are the property of the priest? In that he can purchase with bikkurim slaves and land and unclean beasts, and a creditor of his may take them for his debt, and his wife for her ketubah. As may be done with a Torah scroll. Rabbi Judah says: bikkurim may be given only to a priest that is a haver and as a favor. But the sages say: they are given to the men of the mishmar, and they divide them among themselves as they do with all other consecrated objects.","3628":"The hermaphrodite is in some ways like men, and in other ways like women. In other ways he is like men and women, and in others he is like neither men nor women.","3629":"In what ways is he like men?He causes impurity with white discharge, like men; He dresses like men; He can take a wife but not be taken as a wife, like men. When he is born his mother counts the blood of purification, like men; He may not be secluded with women, like men. He is not maintained with the daughters, like men; He transgresses the law of: \u201cYou shall not round\u201d like men; And he must perform all the commandments of the Torah, like men.","3630":"And in what ways is he like women?He causes impurity with red discharge, like women; And he must not be secluded with men, like women; And he doesn\u2019t make his brother\u2019s wife liable for yibbum (levirate marriage); And he does not share in the inheritance with the sons, like women; And he cannot eat most holy sacrifices, like women. At his birth his mother counts the blood of her impurity like they do when they give birth to a girl; And he is disqualified from being a witness, like women. If he had illicit intercourse, he is disqualified from eating terumah, like women.","3631":"In what ways is he like both men and women?One who strikes him or curses him is liable, as in the case of men and women; One who unwittingly kills him must go into exile, and if on purpose, then the slayer receives the death penalty, as in the case of men and women. His mother must at his birth bring an offering, as in the case of men and women. He may eat holy things that are eaten outside of the Temple; And he may inherit any inheritance, as in the case of men and women.","3632":"And in what is he different from both men and women? One does not burn terumah if it came into contact with his discharge, Neither is he liable for entering the temple while impure, unlike men or women. He must not be sold as a Hebrew slave, unlike men or women. He cannot be evaluated, unlike men or women. If one says: \u201cI will be a nazirite, if he is neither a man nor a woman,\u201d then he becomes a nazirite. Rabbi Yose says: the hermaphrodite is a unique creature, and the sages could not decide about him. But this is not so with a tumtum (one of doubtful), for sometimes he is a man and sometimes he is a woman.","3633":"Five species of grains are subject to the law of hallah: wheat, barley, spelt, oats and rye. These are subject to hallah, and dough made from different types of these grains are accounted together one with another as one quantity. And their \u201cnew\u201d harvest is prohibited prior to Pesah, and they are subject to the prohibition of reaping prior to the Omer. If they took root prior to the Omer, the omer permits them. If not, they are prohibited until the next Omer has come.","3634":"If one has eaten of these five on Pesah an olive-size piece of matzah, he has fulfilled his obligation. If he ate on Pesah an olive-size of piece of hametz made of these grains, he is liable for karet. If one of these grains, having become leavened, became mixed with any other species, one must remove it on Pesah. If one has vowed to abstain from consuming bread and tevuah (produce), he is prohibited from consuming these five species the words of Rabbi Meir. The sages say: if one has vowed to abstain from consuming dagan, is prohibited only from consuming these species only. They are subject to hallah and tithes.","3635":"The following are subject to hallah, but exempt from tithes: gleanings, from the forgotten sheaf, from peah or from ownerless produce and the first tithe from which terumah has been removed, second tithe and consecrated produce which has been redeemed, and that which remains over from the omer, and grain which has not grown one-third ripe. Rabbi Eliezer says: grain which has not grown one-third ripe is exempt also from hallah.","3636":"The following are liable for tithes, but exempt from hallah: rice, millet, poppy-seed, sesame seeds, pulse, and less than five-fourths of a kab of the five kinds of grain, sponge-cakes, honey-cakes, dumplings, a cake cooked in a pan and medumma are exempt from hallah.","3637":"Dough which was originally intended for sponge-cakes, and in the end is cooked as sponge-cake, is exempt from hallah. If it was originally ordinary dough, but in the end cooked as sponge-cakes, or if it was originally intended for sponge-cakes, but finally cooked as ordinary dough, it is subject to hallah. Similarly, bread crumbs are subject to hallah.","3638":"Meisah: Bet Shammai exempts from hallah, And Bet Hillel makes liable for hallah. Halita: Bet Shammai makes liable, And Bet Hillel exempts. The loaves of the thanksgiving sacrifice and the wafers of a nazirite: if one made them for oneself, they are exempt from hallah. If one made them to sell in the market, they are subject to hallah.","3639":"A baker who made dough to divide it up into pieces, it is subject to hallah. Women who gave flour to a baker to make for them dough, if there is not in any one of them a minimum measure, it is exempt from hallah.","3640":"Dough for dogs:If shepherds eat it: it is subject to hallah, and one may use it to make an eruv or a shittuf; and one should say the blessings over it, and one should make an invitation for birkat hamazon over it; and it may be made on a festival; and one fulfills his obligation with it on Pesah. But if shepherds do not eat it: it is not subject to hallah; and one may not use it to make an eruv, or a shittuf; and one does not say the blessings over it, and one does not make an invitation for birkat hamazon over it; and it may not be made on a festival; and one does not fulfill his obligation with it on Pesah. In either case it is susceptible to ritual defilement affecting food.","3641":"In the case of hallah and terumah:One is liable for death on account of having eaten them death intentionally, or to repay an added fifth if unwittingly; They are forbidden to non-priests; They are the property of the priest; They are nullified in a mixture of one-hundred-and-one parts, the rest being non-sacred dough or produce; They require washing of one\u2019s hands; And waiting until the setting of the sun prior to eating them; They may not be separated from pure stuff for impure; But rather from that which is close, And from that in a finished state. If one said: \u201cAll my threshing-floor is terumah, or all my dough is hallah,\u201d he has not said anything, unless he has left some over.","3642":"Produce grown outside the land of Israel that came into the land is subject to Hallah. If it went out from here to there: Rabbi Eliezer makes it liable, But Rabbi Akiva makes it exempt.","3643":"Earth from outside the land has come to the land of Israel in a boat, the produce grown in it is subject to tithes and to the law relating to the seventh year. Rabbi Judah: when does this apply? When the boat touches the ground. Dough which has been kneaded with fruit-juice is subject to hallah, and may be eaten with unclean hands.","3644":"A woman may sit and separate hallah while she is naked, since she can cover herself  but a man may not. If one is not able to make one's dough in cleanness he should make it in separate kavs,   rather than make it in uncleanness. But Rabbi Akiva says: let him make it in uncleanness rather than make it in separate kavs, just as he calls the clean, so too he calls the unclean; this one he cals hallah with the Name, and the other he also calls hallah with the Name, but separate kavs have no portion devoted to the Name.","3645":"One who makes his dough in separate kavs, and they touch one another, they are exempt from hallah unless they stick together. Rabbi Eliezer says: also if one takes out loaves from an oven and puts them into a basket, the basket joins them together for the purposes of hallah.","3646":"If one separates his hallah while it is still flour, it is not hallah, and in the hand of a priest it is considered stolen property. The dough is still subject to hallah; And the flour, if there is the minimum quantity, it also is subject to hallah. And it is prohibited to non-priests, the words of Rabbi Joshua. They said to him: It happened that a non-priest sage seized it for himself. He said to them: He did something damaging to himself, but he benefited others.","3647":"Five-fourths of a kav of flour are subject to hallah. If their leaven, their light bran and their coarse bran make up the five-fourths, they are subject. If their coarse bran had been removed from them and returned to them, they are exempt.","3648":"The minimum measure of hallah is one twenty-fourth part of the dough. If he makes dough for himself, or if he makes it for his son\u2019s wedding banquet, it is one twenty-fourth. If a baker makes to sell in the market, and so also if a woman makes to sell in the market, it is one forty-eighth. If dough is made unclean either unwittingly or by an unforeseeable circumstance, it is one forty-eighth. If it was made unclean intentionally, it is one twenty-fourth, in order that a sinner should not profit.","3649":"Rabbi Eliezer says: Hallah may be taken from dough that is clean, in order to exempt that which is unclean. How may this be done? If one has clean dough and unclean dough, he takes sufficient hallah out of the clean dough whose hallah has not yet been taken, and puts dough less than the size of an egg in the middle, in order that he may take off the hallah from what is close together. But the sages prohibit.","3650":"One may snack from dough, until it is rolled, in the case of wheat flour, or before it is made into a solid mass, in the case of barley flour. Once one has rolled it in the case of wheat flour, or made it into a solid mass, in the case of barley flour, one who eats it is liable for death at the hands of heaven. As soon as she puts in the water she should lift out the hallah, provided that there are not five-fourths of a kav of flour left there.","3651":"Dough which became medumma before she had rolled it, it is exempt from hallah. If after she had rolled it, it is subject to hallah. If there occurred to her some doubtful uncleanness before she had rolled it, it may be completed in uncleanness. If after she had rolled it, it should be completed in cleanness.","3652":"If she dedicated her dough to the Temple before rolling it, and then redeemed it, it is subject to hallah. If she dedicated it after rolling it, and redeemed it, it is subject to hallah. But if she dedicated it before rolling it, and the Temple treasurer rolled it, and after that she redeemed it, it is exempt, since at the time of its obligation it was exempt.","3653":"Similarly one who dedicates his produce prior to the stage when they are subject to tithes   and then redeemed them, they are liable to be tithed. If he dedicated them when they had already become subject to tithes and then redeemed them, they are liable to be tithed. If he dedicated them before they had ripened, and they became ripe while in the possession of the Temple treasurer, and he then redeemed them, they are exempt, since at the time when they would have been liable, they were exempt.","3654":"If a Gentile gave flour to an Israelite to make for him dough, it is exempt from hallah. If the Gentile gave it to him as a gift, before rolling it, he is liable. If after rolling it, he is exempt. If one makes dough together with a Gentile, then if there is not in the portion of the Israelite the minimum measure subject to hallah, it is exempt from hallah.","3655":"A convert who converted and had dough: if it was made before he became a convert, he is exempt from hallah. After he converted, he is liable. And if there is doubt, he is liable, but a non-priest who has unwittingly eaten of such hallah is not liable for the additional one-fifth. Rabbi Akiva said: it all depends on the time of the formation of the light crust in the oven.","3656":"One who makes dough from wheat flour and from rice flour if it has a taste of grain, it is subject to hallah, and one can fulfill one\u2019s obligation with it on Pesah. But if it does not have the taste of grain, it is not subject to hallah, and one cannot fulfill with it one\u2019s obligation on Pesah.","3657":"One who takes leaven out of dough from which hallah had not been taken and puts it into dough from which hallah had been taken:If he has a supply from another place, he can take out hallah in accordance with the precise amount. But if does not, he takes out one portion of hallah for the whole dough.","3658":"Similarly, if olives of regular picking became mixed with olives left over for striking-off   by the poor, or grapes of regular picking, with grapes left over for gleaning by the poor:If he has a supply from another place, he can take out terumah and tithes in accordance with the precise amount. But if does not, he takes out one terumah and terumat maaser for all of the grapes. And as for the rest, he takes out tithe and the second tithe in accordance with the precise amount.","3659":"One who takes leaven from a dough of wheat flour and puts it into dough of rice flour,   then if it has the taste of grain, it is subject to hallah, but if not, it is exempt. If so, why did they say: \u201cUntithed produce of any amount renders food prohibited\u201d? That is with regard to a mixture of a species with its own species, but with regard to a mixture of a species not with its own species, only when it imparts taste.","3660":"Two women who made separate doughs from two separate kavs, and these doughs touched one another, even if they are of the same species, they are exempt from hallah. When they belong to one woman: If one species comes into contact with the same species, they are subject to hallah. If different species, they are exempt.","3661":"What counts as a species with its same species?Wheat is not reckoned together with any species other than with spelt; Barley is reckoned together with all species except wheat. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: the rest of the species are reckoned together one with another.","3662":"If there are two doughs from two separate kavs, and a kav of rice dough or a kav of terumah dough lying between, they are not reckoned together. If there was dough from which hallah had already been taken lying between, they are reckoned together, since it had once been subject to hallah.","3663":"A kav of dough made from new grain and a kav of dough from old grain which are stuck together: Rabbi Ishmael says: let him take hallah from the middle; But the sages prohibit. One who has taken hallah from dough made out of one kav: Rabbi Akiva says: it is hallah; But the sages say: it is not hallah.","3664":"Two separate kavs of dough, this one had its hallah removed on its own, and this one had its hallah removed on its own, and then he went back and made of them one dough: Rabbi Akiva exempts; But the sages make it liable. It turns out that the stringency of his first ruling leads to the leniency of his other ruling.","3665":"A man may take the requisite amount for hallah out of clean dough from which hallah has not previously been removed in order to remove it in a state of cleanness   in order to go on separating hallah from it for unclean demai, until it becomes putrid, since hallah for demai may be taken from clean dough for unclean dough, and from one dough for another dough which is not in close proximity.","3666":"An Israelite who was a tenant of a non-Jew in Syria: Rabbi Eliezer makes their produce liable to tithes and to the law of the sabbatical year; But Rabban Gamaliel makes it exempt. Rabban Gamaliel says: one is to give two hallah-portions in Syria; But Rabbi Eliezer says: only one hallah-portion. They adopted the lenient ruling of Rabban Gamaliel and the lenient ruling of Rabbi Eliezer. Eventually they went back and acted in accordance with Rabban Gamaliel in both respects.","3667":"Rabban Gamaliel says: there are three territories with regard to liability to hallah:From the land of Israel to Chezib: one hallah-portion. From Chezib to the river and to Amanah: two hallah-portions. One for the fire and one for the priest. The one for the fire has a minimum measure, and the one for the priest does not have a minimum measure. From the river and from Amanah and inward: two hallah-portions. One for the fire and one for the priest. The one for the fire has no minimum measure, and the one for the priest has a minimum measure. And a priest who has immersed himself during the day and has not waited till sunset for his purification to be complete may eat it. Rabbi Yose says: he does not require immersion. But it is forbidden to zavim and zavot, to menstruants, and to women after childbirth; It may be eaten with a non-priest at the same table; And it may be given to any priest.","3668":"These may be given to any priest:Devoted things (haramim); Firstlings; The redemption of the first born; The lamb substituted as ransom for the firstling of a donkey; The shoulder, the two cheeks and the maw; The first of the fleece; Oil fit only for burning; Consecrated food which must be eaten within the Temple; And bikkurim. Rabbi Judah prohibits bikkurim. Vetches of terumah: Rabbi Akiva permits, But the sages prohibit.","3669":"Nittai of Tekoa brought hallah-portions from Be-Yitur, but they did not accept from him. The people of Alexandria brought hallah, but they did not accept from them. The people from Mt. Zevoim brought bikkurim prior to Atzeret (Shavuot), but they did not accept from them, on for it is written in the Torah: \u201cAnd the festival of the harvest, the first-fruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field\u201d (Exodus 23:16).","3670":"Ben Antigonus brought up firstlings from Babylon, but they did not accept from him. Joseph the priest brought first fruits of wine and oil, but they did not accept from him. He also brought up his sons and members of his household to celebrate Pesah katan in Jerusalem, but they turned him back, so that the thing should not become firmly fixed as an obligation. Ariston brought his first fruits from Apamea and they accepted from him, because they said, one who buys a field in Syria is as one who buys a field in the outskirts of Jerusalem.","3671":"The following are treated leniently in regard to the rules of demai: unripe figs, wild jujuba, azarolus, wild white figs, young sycamore figs, fallen dates, fennel and capers. In Judea also sumac, Judean vinegar, and coriander. Rabbi Judah says: all unripe figs are exempt, except for those from a tree that bears fruit twice a year.  All wild jujuba are exempt, except the wild jujuba of Shikmonah.  All young sycamore figs are exempt, except those that have been scarified.","3672":"The second tithe of demai is not subject to the rules of adding a fifth. It has no mandated time of removal. It may be eaten by an onen. It may be brought into Jerusalem and taken out again. They may allow a small amount to be lost on the road. One may give it to an am haaretz and consume its equivalent in Jerusalem. Second tithe money of demai may be redeemed silver coins for other silver coins, copper coins for other copper coins, silver for copper, and copper for produce, provided that the produce is again redeemed for money, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: the produce itself must be brought up and eaten in Jerusalem.","3673":"If a man bought grain from an am haaretz to be used for seed or for animal feed, flour for hides, oil for a lamp, or oil for greasing utensils, it is exempt from the rules of demai. Produce grown beyond Cheziv and north is exempt from the rules of demai. The hallah of an am haaretz, produce mixed with terumah, produce bought with second tithe money, and the leftovers of minhah offerings are exempt from the rules of demai. Oil spiced with spices from an am haaretz: Bet Shammai makes it liable to the rules of demai. But Bet Hillel exempts it.","3674":"Demai may be used to make an eruv, and to make an alley partnership, and they recite a blessing over it, and they make an invitation to recite Birkat Hamazon over it, and one may separate tithes from it even when one is naked, or when it is twilight on the eve of Shabbat. And if he took out second tithe from it before the first tithe, it doesn\u2019t matter. The oil with which the weaver greases his fingers is liable to the rules of demai, but the oil which the wool-comber puts on the wool is exempt from the rules of demai.","3675":"The following things must be tithed as demai in all places:  pressed figs, dates, carobs, rice, and cumin. As to rice from outside the land of Israel, whoever uses it is exempt from tithing it.","3676":"One who accepts upon himself to be trustworthy (ne\u2019eman), must tithe whatever he eats and whatever he sells and whatever he buys, and he may not be the guest of an am haaretz. Rabbi Judah says: even one who is the guest of an am haaretz can still be considered trustworthy. They said to him: He is not trustworthy in respect of himself! How can he be considered trustworthy in respect of others?","3677":"One who takes upon himself to become a \u201cchaver\u201d may not sell to an am haaretz either moist or dry produce, nor may he buy from him moist produce, nor may he be the guest of an am haaretz, nor may he host an am haaretz as a guest while the am haaretz is wearing his own garment. Rabbi Judah says: he may not also raise small animals, nor may make a lot of vows or merriment, nor may he defile himself by contact with the dead.  Rather he should be an attendant at the house of study. They said to him: these requirements do not come within the general rule of being a chaver.","3678":"Bakers the sages did not obligate them to separate from demai produce any more than suffices for terumat maaser and for hallah. Grocers may not sell demai produce. All merchants who supply in large quantities may sell demai. Who are those who supply in large quantities?  Those such as wholesalers and grain-sellers.","3679":"Rabbi Meir says: if produce which is usually measured out for sale in a large quantity was measured out in a small quantity, the small quantity is treated as if it was a large   quantity. If produce which is usually measured out for sale in a small quantity was measured out in a large quantity, the large quantity is treated as if it was a small   quantity. What is considered a large quantity? For dry produce three kavs, and for liquids, the value of one dinar. Rabbi Yose says: baskets of figs, baskets of grapes, and bushels of vegetables when he sells them in lumps, they are exempt from the rules of demai.","3680":"They may feed demai to the poor and to guests (alt. passing troops). Rabban Gamaliel used to feed demai to his workmen. As for charity collectors: Bet Shammai says: they should give tithed produce to one who doesn\u2019t tithe, and untithed produce to one who does tithe.  In this way it will turn out that every one will eat produce that has been fixed (tithed). But the sages say: they may collect indiscriminately and distribute indiscriminately. And one who wishes to fix his produce by tithing it, let him fix it.","3681":"One who wants to cut off leaves of vegetables in order to lighten his burden, he may not throw them down until he has first tithed them. One who takes vegetables from the market with the intention of buying them, and then decides to put them back, he should not put them back until he has first tithed them, for nothing is missing after they are tithed except for their quantity. But if he was standing there and deciding what to buy and then saw another load of better quality, he may put them back untithed, since he had not yet drawn them into his possession.","3682":"If one finds produce on the road and picks it up in order to eat it, and then decides to hide it, he may not hide it unless he has first tithed it. But if from the outset he picked it up only in order to guard it against being destroyed, he is exempt from tithing it. Any produce which one may not sell in the condition of demai, he may not send it as a gift to his friend in the condition of demai. Rabbi Yose permits one to send as a gift produce that is certainly untithed, on condition that he makes the matter known to the recipient.","3683":"One who takes his wheat to a Samaritan miller or to an am haaretz miller, the wheat when ground retains its former status in respect of tithes and the law of seventh year produce. But if he carried it to a Gentile miller, the wheat when ground has the status of demai. One who deposited his produce with a Samaritan or am haaretz, the produce retains its former status in respect of tithes and the law of seventh year produce. But if he left it with a Gentile, it is like the produce of the Gentile. Rabbi Shimon says: it becomes demai.","3684":"One who gives produce to an innkeeper to prepare it for food, he must tithe what he gives to her and what he takes back from her, because she is suspected of exchanging it with her own produce. Rabbi Yose said: we are not responsible for deceivers. Rather, he must tithe only that which he takes from her.","3685":"One who gives produce to his mother-in-law to prepare it, he must tithe what he gives to her and what he takes back from her, because she is suspected of changing any food which has spoiled. Rabbi Judah said:  she desires the welfare of her daughter and is ashamed of serving spoiled food to her son-in-law. Rabbi Judah agrees with the other sages that if one gives his mother-in-law seventh year produce, she is not suspected of changing it and giving her daughter to eat of seventh year produce.","3686":"One who buys produce from someone who is not trustworthy in respect of tithes, and he forgot to tithe it, and he asked the seller on Shabbat if they were tithed, he may eat based on his word. At nightfall of Shabbat, he may not eat of it unless he had first tithed it. If he could not find the seller, and another person who was not trustworthy in respect of tithes said to him \u201cthey are tithed,\u201d he may eat of it at his word. At nightfall of Shabbat, he may not eat of it unless he had first tithed it. Terumat maaser of demai which had become mixed up again with the produce from which it had been taken: Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: even on a week day he may ask the seller and eat based on his word.","3687":"One who vowed that his friend could not benefit from him unless he eats with him, and the friend does not trust him in respect of tithes, he may eat with him on the first Shabbat even though he does not trust him in respect of tithes, provided that his friend said to him that the food had been tithed. But on the second week, even though he had vowed that he would not benefit from him, he may not eat with him unless he first tithed the produce.","3688":"Rabbi Eliezer says:  a man need not designate the poor man\u2019s tithe of demai. But the sages say: he must designate it, but he need not separate.","3689":"One who had designated the terumat maaser of demai, or the poor man\u2019s tithe of produce that had certainly not been tithed, he should not separate them on Shabbat. But if the priest or the poor man regularly ate with him, they may come and eat provided that he informs them.","3690":"One who says to another who is not trustworthy in respect of tithes: \u201cBuy produce for me from one who is trustworthy or from one who gives tithes,\u201d the messenger may not be trusted. \u201cBuy it for me from so-and-so,\u201d he is to be trusted. If he went to buy it from him and then came back and said: \u201cI did not find him, so I bought for you from another man who is trustworthy,\u201d he may not be trusted.","3691":"One enters a city and doesn\u2019t know anyone.  He says: \u201cWho here is trustworthy? Who gives tithes here?\u201d One person one responds: \u201cI am.\u201d He may not be trusted. But if he replied: \u201cSo-and-so is trustworthy,\u201d he may be trusted. He went to buy from so-and-so, and he asked him: \u201cWho here sells aged produce?\u201d and so-and-so replied: \u201cHe sent you to me,\u201d though they appear to be repaying each other, they may be trusted.","3692":"If donkey-drivers entered a city and one of them declared: \u201cMy produce is new but my friend\u2019s produce is old,\u201d or, \u201cMy produce has not been tithed but my friend\u2019s produce has been tithed,\u201d they may not be trusted. Rabbi Judah says: they may be trusted.","3693":"One who buys bread from a baker how should he tithe? He should take sufficient for the terumat maaser and for hallah and say: \u201cA hundredth part of what is here shall be tithe on this side, and what is nearest to it shall be the rest of the tithe.

And the one hundred parts of non-sacred produce which is here on this side shall be tithe, and the rest that is next to it is tithe. That which I made tithe shall become the terumat maaser for it. The remainder will be hallah, and the second tithe tithe is to the north or to the south of it and that will be exchanged for money.\u201d","3695":"One who bought bread from a baker, he may give tithe from hot bread for cold bread or from cold bread for hot bread, even when they are of various moulds, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah prohibits it, because I say that yesterday\u2019s wheat was bought from one man   and today\u2019s wheat from another man. Rabbi Shimon prohibits it in the case of terumat maaser, but permits it in the case of hallah.","3696":"If one bought from a bread seller he must tithe every mould separately, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: he may give tithes from one mould for all the others. But Rabbi Judah agrees that one who bought from a monopolist he must tithe every mould separately.","3697":"One who buys from a poor man, and similarly a poor man to whom they given slices of bread or pieces of fig-cake, he must tithe every piece. But in the case of dates and dried figs he may mix them together and take the tithes from the mixture. Rabbi Judah said: When is this so?  When the amount of dates or dried figs given to the poor man was large; but when the amount was small, he must tithe each separately.","3698":"One who buys from a wholesaler, and then buys from him again, he may not give tithes from the one purchase for the other, even when both came from the same basket and even from the same kind.

If one gave terumah from produce grown in the soil for produce grown in a perforated pot, or from produce grown in a perforated pot for produce grown in the soil, his terumah is terumah. If he gave terumah from produce grown in a pot that was not perforated for produce grown in a pot that was perforated, it is terumah, but he must go back and give terumah again. If he gave terumah from produce grown in a perforated pot for produce grown in a pot which was not perforated, it is terumah, but it may not be eaten until he first gives terumah and tithes for it.","3703":"If one gave terumah from produce of demai for other produce of demai, or from produce of demai for produce which was certainly untithed, this becomes terumah, but he must give terumah over again.

One who has hired a field from a Jew for a fixed amount from the produce, he first gives terumah from the rental and then gives it to him (the field owner). Rabbi Judah said: When is this so?  When he pays him the rental with produce of the same field and of the same kind; but when he pays him with the produce of another field or of another kind, he must also tithe the rental first and then give it to him.","3705":"One who has hired a field from a Gentile for a fixed amount from the produce, he first gives tithes from the rental and then gives it to him (the field owner).

But the sages say: the city dweller may go up and eat the second tithe in Jerusalem.","3708":"An Israelite who rents olive trees from a priest or a Levite for a share in the oil: just as they divide the non-sacred produce, so they divide the terumah.

He turns the soil and then he may sow the barley, if it the wheat had already grown. He should not say: \u201cI shall first sow the barley and, then turn the soil\u201d rather he must first turn the soil and then sow. How much must he plow when overturning the soil?

If his field was of wheat and that of his neighbor\u2019s was of wheat, he may sow next to him a row of flax, but not a row of any other species.

One who wants to sow one type of grain in a field of another type of grain the measure is a bet rova. Vegetables within a field of other vegetables the measure is six handbreadths. Vegetables within a field of grain, or grain within a field of vegetables the measure is a bet rova.

Rabbi Judah said: it is permitted to sow six species in the middle.","3745":"They may not sow different species of seeds in one bed, but they may sow different species of vegetables in one bed. Mustard and small polished peas are a species of seed; large peas are a species of vegetable. If a border was originally a handbreadth high and then it fell in height, it remains valid,   since it was valid at the beginning. A furrow or water channel which are a handbreadth deep, it is permitted to sow three different species of vegetables, one on one side, one on the other side, and one in the middle.","3746":"If the point of an angle of a vegetable field overlaps into a field of another vegetable, it is permitted because it looks like the end of his field. His field was sown with a certain vegetable and he wants to plant in it a row of another vegetable: Rabbi Ishmael says: he may do so as long as a furrow runs through from one end of the field to the other. Rabbi Akiva says: as long as it is six handbreadths long and fully as wide. Rabbi Judah says: as long as the width is the full width of a footstep.","3747":"Planting two rows of cucumbers, two rows of gourds, and two rows of Egyptian beans is permitted. But planting one row of cucumbers, one row of gourds and one row of egyptian beans is prohibited. Planting one row of cucumbers, one row of gourds, one row of Egyptian beans and again one row of cucumbers: Rabbi Eliezer permits, But the sages forbid.","3748":"One may plant a cucumber and a gourd in one hole, as long as this species inclines in one direction, and the other species in the opposite direction.

Rabbi Akiva says: he pulls up two rows of onions, plants in the cleared space two rows of gourds, then he leaves onions over a space of two rows, pulls up two rows of onions, and plants two rows of gourds; and so on. The sages say: if between one row of gourds and the next there are not twelve cubits, one may not allow that which is sown in the intervening space to remain.","3750":"A gourd sown among a different vegetable must be separated by as much as any other vegetable. A gourd sown among grain he must give it a separating space of a bet rova. If his field was sown with grain, and he wishes to plant within it a row of gourds, he must give the gourds six handbreadths for them to be worked. And if the row of gourds overgrows into the border he must pull up that which is within it. Rabbi Yose says: he must give the gourds four cubits for them to be worked. They said to him: Do you rule more stringently with regard to this than with regard to a vine? He said to them: We find that the gourd is treated more stringently than a vine, since for a single vine he must give six handbreadths for it to be worked, but for a single gourd a bet rova. Rabbi Meir said in the name of Rabbi Ishmael: if there are as many as three gourds in a bet seah, he may not bring another seed into the bet seah.

But Bet Hillel says: sixteen cubits. A mehol an unsown belt of ground between a planted area and a fence of a vineyard: Bet Shammai says: it must measure sixteen cubits. But Bet Hillel says: twelve cubits. What is a karahat of a vineyard? A vineyard which has been cleared of vines in its middle. If there are less than sixteen cubits, then one may not bring seed into it. If it is sixteen cubits, they leave a space in which to work the vineyard and they may sow the rest.","3752":"What is a mehol in a vineyard? The space between the vineyard and a fence. If there are less than twelve cubits, then one may not bring seed into it. If there are twelve cubits, they leave a space in which to work the vineyard and they may sow the rest.","3753":"Rabbi Judah says: this is nothing but the fence of the vineyard fence. What then is a mehol of a vineyard? A space between two vineyards. What is considered a fence?  One that is ten handbreadths high. And what is considered a trench? One ten handbreadths deep and four wide.","3754":"A partition of reeds:  if between one reed and another there are less than three handbreadths, the space through which a kid could enter, it counts as a legally effective partition. A stone fence which has been broken through up to the length of ten cubits, the breach is regarded as a doorway; more than that, opposite the breach it is prohibited to sow seeds. If there were many breaches in the fence, if that which remains standing exceeds that which is broken through, it is permitted to sow there. But if the breached sections exceed those which remain standing, it is forbidden to sow opposite the breaches.","3755":"One who has planted a row of at least five vines: Bet Shammai says: these constitute a vineyard. But Bet Hillel says: they do not constitute a vineyard unless there are two rows. Consequently, one who sows four cubits within the vineyard: Beth Shammai says: he has sanctified one row of the vineyard, and created kilayim. But Bet Hillel says: he has sanctified two rows.","3756":"One who plants two vines opposite two other vines, and one other vine forming a \u201ctail\u201d behold this is a vineyard. Two vines opposite two other vines, and one other vine in between, or two opposite two, and one in the middle, these are not a vineyard until there are two opposite two with one other forming a tail.","3757":"One who has planted one row of vines on his own land and another row on his neighbor's land, and there is a private road or a public road in the middle, or a fence lower than ten handbreadths, these two rows combine. If there is a fence higher than ten handbreadths they do not combine. Rabbi Judah says: If he intertwines them the rows of vines above the fence they do combine.","3758":"One who has planted two rows of vines if there are not eight cubits between them, he may not bring seed there in the space between the two rows. If there are three rows if there are not between one row and its companion sixteen cubits he may not bring seed there. Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob said in the name of Hananya ben Hakinai: even if the middle row was laid waste and there is not between one row and its companion row sixteen cubits, he may not bring seed there, but if he had planted them two rows at the outset, it is permitted to sow between them if they are eight cubits apart.","3759":"One who plants his vineyard sixteen cubits, sixteen cubits separating each row, he may bring seed there. Rabbi Judah said: It happened at Tsalmon that a man planted his vineyard on a plan of sixteen cubits, sixteen cubits separating each row.  One year he would turn the tips of the vine branches of two adjacent rows towards one place, and sow the furrow in between, and the following year he would turn the tips of the vine branches in the opposite direction, and sow the land which had been left untilled the preceding year. The matter came before the sages, and they declared it permitted. Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon say: even one who has planted his vineyard with eight cubits between every two rows, this is permitted.","3760":"A vineyard that has been partly ruined:  if it is still possible to harvest ten vines within a bet seah, and they are planted according to halakhah, behold this is called a \u201cpoor vineyard.\u201d A vineyard planted in a mixed-up manner, if there remains an alignment of one line of two parallel vines opposite a line of three vines, it constitutes a vineyard, but if not it is not a vineyard. Rabbi Meir says: since it is in appearance like a vineyard in general, it is a vineyard.","3761":"A vineyard that has been planted with less than four cubits in between rows of vines: Rabbi Shimon says: this is not a vineyard. But the sages say: it is a vineyard, and we look at the middle rows as if they were \tnot there.","3762":"A trench passing through a vineyard, ten handbreadths deep and four wide:   Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: if it runs right through from the beginning of the vineyard to the end, it looks like it is in between two separately owned vineyards, and it is permitted to sow in it.  But if it is not, it is regarded as if it were part of a winepress. And as for a winepress in a vineyard, and the winepress is ten handbreadths deep and four wide:  Rabbi Eliezer says: it is permitted to sow in it. But the sages prohibit. A watchman\u2019s mound in a vineyard, ten handbreadths high and four wide: it is permitted to sow in it. But if the ends of the vine-branches become intertwined over it, it is forbidden. ","3763":"A vine planted in a winepress or in a depression in the ground, they leave it room to work on it, and one may sow on the rest. Rabbi Yose says: if there are not four cubits there, one may not bring seed there. As for a house that is within a vineyard, it is permitted to sow there.","3764":"One who plants a vegetable or leaves it to remain in a vineyard, he renders prohibited as kilayim forty-five vines. When is this so? When they were planted with either four or five cubits between rows. If they were planted with either six or seven cubits between rows he renders prohibited as kilayim the vines within an area of sixteen cubits in every direction, in the form of a circle, not of a square.","3765":"One who sees a vegetable in a vineyard, and said: \u201cWhen I reach it I will pluck it,\u201d it is permitted. But if he says: \u201cWhen I come back I will pluck it,\u201d if the vegetable has in the meantime increased by a two-hundredth, it is forbidden.","3766":"If he was passing through a vineyard, and seeds fell from him, or seeds went into the field with manure, or with irrigation water, or if he was in a grain field scattering seed and the wind blew some behind him into a vineyard, everything is permitted. If the wind blew the seed in front of him into a vineyard, Rabbi Akiba says: If it has produced small shoots, he must turn the soil. If it has reached the stage of green ears, he must beat them out. If it has grown into grain, it must be burnt.","3767":"One who allows thorns to remain growing in a vineyard: Rabbi Eliezer says: he thereby prohibits the vineyard. But the sages say: he does not prohibit except if it something that is generally allowed to grow. Iris, ivy, and the king\u2019s lily, and all manner of seeds are not kilayim in a vineyard. As for hemp: Rabbi Tarfon said: it is not kilayim, But the sages say it is kilayim. Artichokes are kilayim in a vineyard.","3768":"What is an aris which is regarded as a vineyard? One who has planted a single row consisting of five vines beside a fence ten handbreadths high, or beside a trench ten handbreadths deep and four wide, they leave a space of four cubits in which to work it. Bet Shammai says: they measure the four cubits from the body of the vine to the field; But Bet Hillel says: from the fence to the field. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said: all who say so are mistaken! Rather, if there are four cubits from the body of the vines to the fence, they leave a space in which to work it and they may sow the rest. And how much is the space in which work to work a vine? Six handbreadths in every direction. Rabbi Akiva says: three.","3769":"An aris which projects from a terrace: Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob says: if a person standing on level ground is able to harvest all of it, such an aris prohibits sowing seed in four cubits of the field, but if he is not able to do so, it prohibits sowing seed only in the soil which is directly below it. Rabbi Eliezer says: even one who has planted one row of vines on the ground, and one on a terrace, then if it is ten handbreadths above the level ground, one does not combine with the other; if it is not ten handbreadths high then one does combine with the other.","3770":"One who suspends vines over papyrus-ropes of a trellis, he may not bring seed beneath the remainder of the trellis. However, if he did so, he has not caused them to be prohibited. If new tendrils spread over the remainder, that which was sown under the remainder is forbidden. Similarly, when one hangs vines over some part of a non-fruit-bearing tree.","3771":"One who suspends branches of a vine on part of the branches of a fruit tree, it is permitted to bring seed beneath the remainder. If new tendrils spread over the remainder, he must turn them back. It happened that Rabbi Joshua went to Rabbi Ishmael in Kefar Aziz, and the latter showed him a vine with its branches suspended on part of the branches of a fig tree. He Rabbi Yishmael asked him Rabbi Joshua: \u201cMay I bring seed beneath the remainder?\u201d He answered him: \u201cIt is permitted.\u201d He took him to Bet Hamaganyah and he showed him a vine whose branches were suspended on part of a beam belonging to the trunk of a sycamore, which had many beams. He Rabbi Joshua said to him Rabbi Yishmael: beneath this beam it is prohibited to sow but beneath the remainder it is permitted.","3772":"What is a serak tree?Any tree which does not yield fruit. Rabbi Meir says: all trees are serak, except the olive and the fig tree. Rabbi Yose says: all trees that are not planted in whole fields, are serak trees.","3773":"Gaps in an aris must be eight cubits and somewhat more in order to be able to sow seeds in the gaps. In the case of all measurements that the sages said in connection with a vineyard, there is no \u2018and somewhat more\u2019, except in the case of gaps in an aris. The following count as gaps in an aris: if an aris was razed in its middle and five vines remained on one side and five vines on the other side.  Then if the gap is only eight cubits, one may not bring seed there.  But if the gap is eight cubits and somewhat more, they give the vines space to work them, and he may sow the rest.","3774":"An aris which turns away from a wall where it forms an angle, and comes to an end, they give it space to work it and they may sow the rest. Rabbi Yose says: if there are not four cubits there, one may not bring seed there.","3775":"Canes which protrude from the aris and one is too concerned for them to cut them short, it is permitted to sow directly beneath them. If he made them long so that the new growth might spread along them, it is forbidden two sow underneath.","3776":"A blossom which protruded from the aris, it is regarded as if a plumb line were suspended from it, directly beneath it, it is prohibited to sow. Similarly, in the case of a blossom protruding from a hanging branch of a single vine. One who has stretched a vine-shoot from tree to tree, it is forbidden to sow beneath it. If he made an extension to the vine by means of rope or reed, it is permitted under the extension. If he made the extension so that the new growth might spread along it, it is forbidden.","3777":"If one has bent a vine into the ground and then brought it back up elsewhere, then if there is not soil over it to the height of three handbreadths, he may not sow seed above it, even if he bent and conducted it underground through a gourd or through a pipe. If he bent it and conducted it through rocky soil, then even if there is not soil over it to the height of three handbreadths, it is permitted to sow seed above it. As for a knee-like vine formed by burying and conducting it underground, they don\u2019t measure for how much space to work it except from its second root.","3778":"One who has bent and conducted underground three vines, and their original stems are visible, Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok says: if there is between them from four to eight cubits, they combine, if not, they do not combine. A vine which has dried up, it is forbidden to sow near it, but it does not prohibit the seed as kilayim. Rabbi Meir said: the same applies to a cotton plant, it is forbidden to sow near it, but it does not prohibit the seed as kilayim. Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok said in his name: above the vine too, it is forbidden to sow near it, but it does not prohibit the seed as kilayim.","3779":"The following are forbidden, but they do not prohibit the seed sown there:The remainder of a legally inadequate empty patch of a vineyard. The remainder of a legally inadequate mehol of a vineyard. The remainder of a legally inadequate aris-gap. The ground under the remainder of papyrus-ropes of a trellis. But the ground beneath a vine, and within the place left to work a vine, and the ground within four cubits of a vineyard, these do prohibit the seed sown there.","3780":"One who causes his vine to overhang his fellow\u2019s grain, behold he has caused the grain to be prohibited and he is responsible for it. Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon say: a person does not prohibit as kilayim that which is not his own.","3781":"Rabbi Yose said: It happened that a man sowed seed in his vineyard in the sabbatical year,   and the matter came before Rabbi Akiva, who said: a person does not prohibit as kilayim that which is not his own.","3782":"If a forceful occupier has sown seed in a vineyard, and it went out of his possession and reverted to the rightful owner, he should cut it down, even during hol hamoed. Up to what amount should he pay the workers?  Up to a third. If they demand more than this, he should cut it in his usual way even if he has to keep cutting after the festival. At what point is he considered a forceful occupier (anas)? From the the name of the original owner has sunk into oblivion.","3783":"If wind has blown vines so that they hang over grain, one should immediately fence them apart. If an unforeseeable event occurred to him, it the grain is permitted. If grain is bent and the ears reach beneath a vine, similarly in the case of vegetables, one should turn them back, and it does not prohibit as kilayim. From what stage does grain prohibit kilayim? From the time it has struck root. And grapes? From the time they become as large as white beans. Grain which has become completely dried out, and grapes which have fully ripened no longer prohibit as kilayim.","3784":"Seed sown in a perforated flowerpot, prohibits as kilayim in a vineyard. In one not perforated, does not prohibit as kilayim. Rabbi Shimon says: both are forbidden but neither prohibits. One who carries a perforated flowerpot through a vineyard, if that which is sown in it grows a two-hundredth part, it is forbidden.","3785":"Kilayim of the vineyard: it is forbidden both to sow and to allow to grow, and it is forbidden to derive benefit from them. Kilayim of seeds: it is forbidden both to sow and to allow to grow, but it is permitted to eat them, and all the more so to derive benefit from them. Kilayim of clothing: is permitted in all respects, except that it is forbidden to wear them. Kilayim of beasts: it is permitted to raise and to keep, and it is only prohibited to cross-breed them. Kilayim of beasts: these one are prohibited with these.","3786":"A beast with a beast of another species; a wild animal with a wild animal of another species; a behemah with a hayyah; a hayyah with a behemah; an unclean beast with an unclean beast of another species; a clean beast with a clean beast of another species; or an unclean beast with a clean beast; or a clean beast with an unclean beast; they are forbidden for plowing, and it is forbidden to pull them or lead them tied together.","3787":"The person driving the two different animals yoked together receives the forty lashes.   And the person sitting in the wagon receives the forty lashes. But Rabbi Meir exempts the latter. The tying of a third animal different from the two already harnessed to a wagon to the straps of those animals is prohibited.","3788":"They may not tie a horse neither to the sides of a wagon drawn by oxen nor behind the wagon, nor may they tie a Libyan donkey to a wagon drawn by camels. Rabbi Judah says: all mules born from horses, even though their father is a donkey, are permitted one with another.  Likewise mules born from donkey, even though their father is a horse, are permitted one with another. But mules born from a horse with mules born from donkeys are prohibited one with another.","3789":"Mules of uncertain parentage are forbidden one with another, And a ramakh is permitted. Wild man-like creatures are in the category of hayyah. Rabbi Yose says: they cause impurity in a tent like a human being. The hedgehog and the bush-mole are in the category of hayyah. The bush-mole: Rabbi Yose says in the name of Bet Shammai: an olive's size of its carcass renders a person carrying it unclean, and a lentil\u2019s size of its carcass renders a person touching it unclean.","3790":"The wild ox it is in the category of behemah. But Rabbi Yose says: it is in the category of hayyah. The dog  it is in the category of hayyah. But Rabbi Yose says: it is in the category of behemah. The pig  it is in the category of behemah. The wild donkey it is in the category of hayyah. The elephant and the monkey they are in the category of hayyah. A human being is permitted to draw, plow, or lead with any of them.","3791":"Nothing is forbidden on account of kilayim except a mixture of wool and linen. No clothing material is subject to uncleanness by scale disease except wool or linen. Priests do not wear any materials to serve in the Temple except for wool and linen. Camel\u2019s wool with sheep\u2019s wool, that have been mixed together:  if the greater part is camel\u2019s wool, it is permitted to mix it with linen, but if the greater part is sheep\u2019s wool, it is forbidden; if it is half and half, it is forbidden. The same applies to hemp and linen mixed together.","3792":"Silk and floss-silk do not come under the prohibition of kilayim, but are prohibited on account of appearance. Mattresses and pillows do not come under the prohibition of kilayim, as long as his flesh does not come into immediate contact with them. There is no permissibility for the temporary wearing of kilayim. Neither may one wear kilayim even on top of ten garments, even for the purpose of evading taxes.","3793":"Hand towels, scroll covers, and bath towels do not come under the prohibition of kilayim.   Rabbi Eliezer prohibits. Barbers\u2019 covers are subject to the prohibition of kilayim.","3794":"Shrouds for the dead, and the packsaddle of a donkey are not subject to the law of kilayim. One may not however place a packsaddle made of kilayim on one\u2019s shoulder even for the purpose of carrying dung out on it.","3795":"Sellers of clothes may sell clothes made of kilayim in accordance with their custom, as long as they do have not the intention in the sun, to protect themselves from the sun, or in the rain to protect themselves from the rain. The scrupulous hang such materials or garments on a stick over their backs.","3796":"Tailors may sew materials which are kilayim in their usual way, as long as they do have not the intention in the sun, to protect themselves from the sun, or in the rain to protect themselves from the rain. The scrupulous sew such materials as they are laid on the ground.","3797":"The Birrus blanket or Brindisian blanket, or Dalmatian cloth, or felt shoes, may not be worn until one has examined them. Rabbi Yose says: ones that come from the coast or from lands beyond the sea, do not require examination, since the presumption with regard to them is that they are sewn with hemp. Felt-lined shoes are not subject to the laws of kilayim.","3798":"Only that which is spun or woven is forbidden under the law of kilayim, as it says, \u201cYou shall not wear shatnez\u201d tavui and nuz and causes his father in heaven to avert himself from him.","3799":"Felted materials can be prohibited because of kilayim, since they are combed. It is prohibited to attach a string of wool to linen material, since this resembles weaving. Rabbi Yose says: it is forbidden to use cords of purple wool to tie round a loose linen garment, since before he ties it, he stitches it on. One may not tie a strip of woolen material with one of linen material for the purpose of girdling one\u2019s loins, even if there is a leather strap between the two.","3800":"Weaver\u2019s mark\u2019s or launderer\u2019s marks can be prohibited because of kilayim. One who sticks one thread through material, this does not constitute a connection, nor does the prohibition of kilayim apply and one who unties such a connection on Shabbat is exempt. If one made its two ends come out on the same side of the material, this constitutes a connection, and it comes under the prohibition of kilayim, and one who unties such a connection on Shabbat is liable. Rabbi Judah said: the prohibition does not apply until one has made three stitches. A sack and a basket one having a strip of woolen material attached to it, and the other a strip of linen combine to form kilayim.","3801":"Second tithe: one may not sell it, use it as a pledge, exchange it, or use it as a weight. One may not say to his friend even in Jerusalem: \u201cHere is second tithe wine, give me in exchange oil, and the same with all other produce. But people may give it to one another as a free gift.","3802":"Tithe of cattle: one may not sell it when it is unblemished and alive, and when it is blemished one may not sell it neither alive nor slaughtered, nor may one betroth a woman with it. A first-born animal: one may sell it when it is unblemished and alive, and when blemished one may sell it both alive and slaughtered, and one may betroth a wife with it. One may not redeem second tithe with unstamped coins, nor with coins which are not current, nor for money which is not in one's possession.","3803":"One who bought a domesticated animal for a shelamim offering or a wild animal for non-sacrificial eating, the hide becomes hullin non-sacred, even though the value of the hide exceeds the value of the flesh. Sealed jars of wine which were bought in a place where they were usually sold sealed, the jars are hullin. Walnuts and almonds, their shells become hullin. Grape-skin wine: before it has fermented it cannot be bought with second tithe money, but after it has fermented it may be bought with second tithe money.","3804":"One who bought a wild animal for a shelamim offering or a domesticated beast for non-sacrificial eating, the hide does not become hullin. Open or sealed jars of wine which were bought in a place where they are usually sold open, the jars do not become hullin. Baskets of olives or baskets of grapes bought together with the vessel, the value of the vessel does not become hullin.","3805":"One who bought water or salt, or produce still joined to the soil, or produce which cannot reach Jerusalem, he has not purchased maaser sheni. One who bought produce unwittingly, the money must be restored to its former place. But if intentionally, the produce must be taken up and be consumed in the holy place, and when there is no Temple, it must be left to rot.","3806":"One who bought a domesticated animal unwittingly, the money must be restored to its former place. Intentionally, it must be taken up and eaten in the holy place. And when there is no Temple, it must be buried together with its hide.","3807":"One may not buy male slaves or female slaves, land, or unclean animals with maaser sheni money. And if he did buy one of these, its value must be consumed as maaser sheni in Jerusalem. One may not bring bird-offerings of a zav or zavah, or bird-offerings of women after child-birth, or sin-offerings, or guilt-offerings, from maaser sheni money. And if he did buy one of these, their value must be consumed as maaser sheni in Jerusalem. This is the general rule: whatever is bought out of maaser sheni money which cannot be used for eating or drinking or anointing, its value must be consumed as maaser sheni in Jerusalem.","3808":"Second tithe is set apart for eating, for drinking and for anointing; for eating what is usually eaten, for drinking what is usually drunk, and for anointing what is usually used for anointing. One may not anoint oneself with wine or with vinegar, but one may anoint oneself with oil. One may not spice oil of second tithe, nor may one buy spiced oil with second tithe money. But one may spice wine. If honey or spices fell into wine and improved its value, the improved value is divided according to the proportion. If fish was cooked with leek of second tithe and it improved in value, the improved value is divided according to the proportion. If dough of second tithe was baked and it improved in value, the whole improved value is second tithe. This is the general rule: whenever the improvement is recognizable the improved value is divided according to the proportion, but whenever the improved value is not recognizable the improved value belongs to the second tithe.","3809":"Rabbi Shimon says: one may not anoint oneself with oil of second tithe in Jerusalem. But the sages allow it. They said to Rabbi Shimon: if a lenient ruling has been adopted in the case of terumah which is a grave matter, should we not also adopt a lenient ruling in the case of second tithe which is a light matter? He said to them: No; a lenient ruling has been adopted in the case of terumah though it is a grave matter, because in terumah we have adopted a lenient ruling also with regard to vetches and fenugreek, but how can we adopt a lenient ruling in the case of second tithe though it is a light matter, when we have not adopted a lenient ruling in second tithe with regard to vetches and fenugreek?","3810":"Fenugreek of second tithe may be eaten when it is still tender. Fenugreek of terumah: Bet Shammai says: whatever is done with it must be done in a state of purity, except when it is used for cleansing the head. But Bet Hillel says: whatever is done with it may be done in a state of impurity, except soaking it in water.","3811":"Vetches of second tithe may be eaten when still tender. And they may be brought into Jerusalem and taken out again. If they became unclean: Rabbi Tarfon says: they must be divided among pieces of dough. But the sages say: they may be redeemed. Vetches of terumah: Bet Shammai says: they must be soaked and rubbed in a state of purity, but may be given as food to an animal in a state of impurity. Bet Hillel says: they must be soaked only in a state of purity, but they may be rubbed and given as food to an animal in a state of impurity. Shammai says: they must be eaten dry only. Rabbi Akiba says: whatever is done with them may be done in a state of impurity.","3812":"Hullin coins and second tithe coins which were scattered together: whatever is picked up one at a time belongs to second tithe until the sum is completed, and the remainder is hullin. If they were so mixed up as to be taken up by the handful, they are divided according to the proportion. This is the general rule: what is picked up one at a time must be first given to second tithe, but what is picked up mixed quantity is divided according to the proportion.","3813":"A sela of maaser sheni which was mixed up with a sela of hullin, one may bring copper coins for the sela and say: \u201cLet the sela of maaser sheni wherever it may be, be exchanged for these coins.\u201d Then he must select the better of the two selas, and change again the copper coins for it. For they have said: one may change silver for copper only in case of necessity, and not to leave it so but to change it again for silver.","3814":"Bet Shammai says: one may not turn his selas into gold dinars. But Bet Hillel permits it. Rabbi Akiva said: For Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Joshua I turned silver into gold dinars.","3815":"One who changes copper coins of second tithe for a sela: Bet Shammai says: he may change copper coins for a whole sela. But Bet Hillel says: a shekel of silver and a shekel\u2019s worth of copper coins can be exchanged for the sela. Rabbi Meir says: one may not exchange silver and produce for silver. But the sages allow it.","3816":"One who exchanges a sela of second tithe in Jerusalem:Bet Shammai says: he may exchange the whole sela for copper coins. Bet Hillel says: a shekel of silver and a shekel\u2019s worth of copper coins can be exchanged for the sela. Those discussing before the sages say: silver for three dinars and copper coins for one denar. Rabbi Akiva says: silver for three denars and copper coins for a fourth of the fourth denar. Rabbi Tarfon says: four aspers in silver. Shammai says: he must leave it in a shop and eat as much as it is worth.","3817":"If one had some of his sons pure and some impure, he may put down a sela and say: \u201cWhat the pure drink, this sela will be redeemed for it.\u201d In this way the pure and the impure may drink from one jar.","3818":"One should not say to his friend: \u201cCarry up this second tithe produce to Jerusalem that in order to divide it.\u201d Rather he should say to him, \u201cCarry it up that so that we may eat and drink of it in Jerusalem.\u201d But people may give it to one another as a free gift.","3819":"One may not buy terumah with maaser sheni money, because this reduces the number of those who can eat it. But Rabbi Shimon permits it. Rabbi Shimon said to them: If the law is lenient in the case of wellbeing offerings, though they may become unfit or a remnant or unclean, why should it not also be lenient with regard to terumah? But they said to him: The law was lenient in the case of wellbeing offerings, because they are permitted to non-priests, but should we therefore be lenient with regard to terumah, which is forbidden to non-priests?","3820":"One who has second tithe money in Jerusalem and he needs to spend it, and his friend had non-sacred produce, he may say to his friend: \u201cLet this money be exchanged for your produce.\u201d It turns out that the one must eat his produce in purity and the other may do what he needs with his money. But he may not say thus to an am haaretz except when the money was from second tithe of demai.","3821":"If one had hullin produce in Jerusalem and second tithe money in the provinces, he may say: \u201cLet that money be exchanged for this produce.\u201d If he had second tithe money in Jerusalem and hullin produce in the provinces, he may say: \u201cLet this money be exchanged for that produce,\u201d as long as he will carry that produce and eat it in Jerusalem.","3822":"Second tithe money may be brought into Jerusalem and taken out again, but second tithe produce may only be brought in, but not taken out again. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: produce also may be brought in and be taken out again.","3823":"Produce whose processing was completed and it passed through Jerusalem, its second tithe must be brought back and eaten in Jerusalem. If its processing had not been completed, such as baskets of grapes that were going to the wine-press or baskets of figs that were going to the drying-place: Bet Shammai says: its second tithe must be brought back and be eaten in Jerusalem. But Bet Hillel says: it may be redeemed and eaten anywhere. Rabbi Shimon ben Judah says in the name of Rabbi Yose: Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel did not disagree concerning produce whose processing had not been completed that its second tithe may be redeemed and be eaten anywhere. What did they disagree about? About produce whose processing was completed. Bet Shammai says that its second tithe must be brought back and be eaten in Jerusalem. And Bet Hillel says that it may be redeemed and be eaten anywhere. The second tithe of demai may always be brought in and taken out again and be redeemed.","3824":"A tree which stood within Jerusalem and was bending outwards, or if it stood outside Jerusalem and was bending inwards, what is opposite the wall and inwards is deemed as being within, and what is opposite the wall and outwards is deemed as being outside. Olive-presses which have their entrance within and their inner space outside, or which have their entrance outside and their inner space within: Bet Shammai says: the whole is deemed as being within. But Bet Hillel says: what is opposite the wall and inwards is deemed as being within, and what is opposite the wall and outwards is deemed as being outside.","3825":"The chambers of the Temple which were built on holy ground but were open towards common ground: their interior was deemed common and their roofs were deemed holy. Those which were built on common ground but were open towards holy ground: their interior was deemed holy and their roofs were deemed common. Those which were built both on holy and on common ground and were open both towards holy and common ground: the interior and the roofs that were on holy ground and inwards were deemed holy, but the interior and roofs on common ground and outwards were deemed common.","3826":"Second tithe which was brought into Jerusalem and became unclean, whether it became unclean by a principal defilement or by a secondary defilement, whether it became unclean within Jerusalem or outside:Bet Shammai says: it must all be redeemed and be eaten within except that which became unclean by a principal defilement outside.

R. Judah says: it must be buried. They said to Rabbi Judah: if maaser sheni itself when it became unclean may be redeemed, should not also that which is bought with maaser sheni money be redeemed when it became unclean? He said to them: No! If you say this of maaser sheni itself, it is because it may be redeemed also when pure at a distance from the holy place. But how can you say this of that which is bought with maaser sheni money, seeing that it cannot be redeemed when clean at a distance from the holy place.","3828":"If a deer which had been bought with maaser sheni money died, it must be buried together with its hide.

If it was bought slaughtered and it became unclean, behold it is like produce.","3829":"One who lends jars for maaser sheni wine, even if they were corked, they do not acquire the sanctity of maaser sheni. If wine was poured into them without specifying that it was for sale they do not acquire the sanctity of maaser sheni before they are corked, but after they are corked they acquire the sanctity of maaser sheni. Before they are corked they are neutralized in a hundred and one, but after they are corked they sanctify any quantity. Before they are corked terumah may be taken from one jar for all the others, but after they are corked terumah must be taken from each jar separately.","3830":"Bet Shammai says: the jars must be opened and emptied into the wine-press. Bet Hillel says: they must be opened but need not be emptied. When does this apply? In a place where they are usually sold closed, but in a place where they are usually sold open, the jar does not revert to hullin. If, however, he wishes to be stringent upon himself and to sell only by measure, the jar reverts hullin. Rabbi Shimon says: also when one says to his friend, \u201cThis jar of wine I am selling to you from its jar, the jar reverts to hullin.","3831":"One who carries produce of maaser sheni from a place where it is expensive to a place where it is cheap, or from a place where it is cheap to a place where it is expensive, he redeems it according to the market price of the place where he redeems it.

At the price at which the money-changer takes small change and not at the price at which he gives small change. Maaser sheni may not be redeemed in an estimated lump. If its value is known, it may be redeemed according to the evaluation of one. But if its value is not known, it must be redeemed according to the evaluation of three, as for instance in the case of wine which has formed a film, or produce which has begun to rot, or coins which have become rusty.","3833":"If the owner says, \u201cWith a sela I will redeem this maaser sheni and another person says \u201cWith a sela,\u201d the owner has the first right, because he must add a fifth.

When one redeems his maaser sheni he must add a fifth, whether it is his own or it was given him as a gift.","3834":"One may act in a deceptive manner when it comes to maaser sheni. How so? A man may say to his grown-up son or daughter, or to his Hebrew slave or female slave, \u201cTake this money and redeem this maaser sheni for yourself.\u201d But he may not say so to his son or daughter who are minors or to his Canaanite slave or female slave, because their hand is as his own hand.","3835":"One who was standing at the threshing-floor and didn\u2019t have any coins may say to his friend: \u201cBehold, this produce is given to you as a gift,\u201d and then he may say again, \u201cBehold, let this produce be exchanged for money which I have in the house.\u201d","3836":"If one took possession from the owner of maaser sheni for a sela, but before he had time to redeem it, it stood at the price of two selas, he may give him one sela and make a profit of one sela and the maaser sheni remains his. If he took possession from the owner of maaser sheni for two selas, but before he had time to redeem it, it stood at the price of one sela, he may give him one sela out of hullin money and one sela of his maaser sheni money. If the owner was an am haaretz, he should give him out of maaser sheni of demai.","3837":"If one redeemed maaser sheni but did not call it by its name: Rabbi Yose says: it is sufficient. But Rabbi Judah says: he must name it explicitly. If a man was speaking to a woman concerning her divorce or her betrothal, and gave her a get or betrothal money but did not state explicitly what he was doing: Rabbi Yose says: it is sufficient. But Rabbi Judah says: he must say it explicitly.","3838":"One who sets aside an issar for the redemption of maaser sheni and on its account he ate the value of half an issar of maaser sheni and then went to another place where the issar was worth a pondion, he may eat of maaser sheni the value of another issar. One who sets aside a pundion for the redemption of maaser sheni and on its account he ate the value of half a pundion of maaser sheni and then went to another place where the pundion was worth an issar, he may eat maaser sheni the value of another half an issar. One who sets aside an issar of maaser sheni money he should eat on its account eleven parts of the value of an issar, or he should eat an additional one hundredth of an issar. Bet Shammai say: in both cases one tenth part of an issar. But Bet Hillels says: in the case of certain maaser sheni an eleventh part, in the case of demai a tenth part.","3839":"Any money found is considered hullin, even gold dinars with silver and with copper coins. If a potsherd was found with the money on which was written \u201ctithe\u201d this is considered maaser sheni money.","3840":"One who finds a vessel one which was written \u201ckorban:\u201d Rabbi Judah says: if it was of clay, it is itself hullin and what is in it is a korban (holy). But if it was of metal it is itself korban and what is in it is hullin. They said to him: it is not the custom of people to put what is common into what is korban.","3841":"One who finds a vessel on which was written a kof, it is korban. If a mem, it is maaser. If a dalet, it is demai. If a tet, it is tevel (untithed produced). If a tav, it is terumah. For in the time of danger people would write a tav for terumah. Rabbi Yose says: they may all stand for the names of people. Rabbi Yose said: even if he finds a jar which was full of produce and on it was written \u2018terumah\u2019 it may yet be considered hullin, because I can say that last year it was full of produce of terumah and was afterwards emptied.","3842":"One who says to his son, \u201cThere is maaser sheni produce in this corner,\u201d but the son found produce in another corner, this may be considered hullin. If the father said there was there a hundred of maaser sheni and the son found two hundred, the remainder is hullin. If the father said there were there two hundred and the son found one hundred, it is all maaser sheni.","3843":"A vineyard in its fourth year, they mark it with clods of earth, and of orlah with potter's clay, and graves with lime which is dissolved and poured on. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said: When does this apply? In the seventh year. The conscientious used to put down money and say: any fruit gathered from this vineyard may be exchanged for this money.","3844":"The produce of a vineyard in its fourth year was brought up to Jerusalem within a distance of one day\u2019s journey on each side. And what is the border of a day\u2019s journey on each side? Eilat to the south, Akrabat on the north, Lod to the west, and the Jordan river to the east. When produce increased, it was decreed that it can be redeemed even if the vineyard was close to the wall. And there was a stipulation on this matter, that whenever it was so desired, the arrangement would be restored as it had been before. Rabbi Yose says: this was the stipulation after the Temple was destroyed, and the stipulation was that when the Temple should be rebuilt the arrangement would be restored as it had been before.","3845":"The grapes of a vineyard in its fourth year:Bet Shammai says: the laws of the added fifth and removal do not apply to them; But Bet Hillel says: they do. Bet Shammai says: the laws of peret and the defective clusters apply to them, and the poor can redeem the grapes for themselves. But Bet Hillel says: all of them go to the wine-press.","3846":"How does one redeem the fruit of a plant in its fourth year? The owner puts down a basket in the presence of three people and says: \u201cHow many such baskets would a man wish to redeem for himself for a sela on condition that the costs to produce the fruit shall be on his house? And then he puts down the money and says: \u201cWhatever shall be picked from this plant may it be exchanged for this money at the price of so many baskets for a sela.\u201d","3847":"But in the seventh year he must redeem it for its full value. If in other years it had all been made ownerless property, the person who redeems it can only claim the cost of picking it. One who redeems his own plant in its fourth year, he must add a fifth of its value,   whether the fruit was his own or was given him as a gift.","3848":"On the eve of the first others read \u201clast\u201d festival-day of Pesah in the fourth and in the seventh years of the sabbatical cycle the removal was performed. Terumah and the terumah of tithe were given to their owners, the first tithe was given to its owner, the tithe of the poor to its owner, and maaser sheni and first-fruits were removed in every place. Rabbi Shimon says: first-fruits were given to the priests like terumah. As for a cooked dish with maaser sheni in it: Bet Shammai says: it must be removed. But Bet Hillel say: lo, it may be considered as already removed.","3849":"One who had produce at this time and the time of removal arrived:Bet Shammai says: he must exchange it for money. But Bet Hillel says: it is all the same whether it becomes money or it remains fruit.","3850":"Rabbi Judah said: in early times they used to send to householders in the provinces saying: \u201cHasten to set right your produce before the time of removal arrives,\u201d until Rabbi Akiva came and taught that all produce which has not reached the time of tithing is exempt from the removal.","3851":"One whose produce was far away from him, he must call it by name. Once it happened that Rabban Gamaliel and the elders were traveling by ship, and Rabban Gamaliel said: \u201cThe tithe which I shall measure out in the future is given to Joshua, and the place which it is in is leased to him. The other tithe which I shall measure out in the future is given to Akiva ben Joseph that he may hold it for the poor, and the place which it is in is leased to him.\u201d Rabbi Joshua said: \u201cThe tithe taken from terumah which I shall measure out is given to Elazar ben Azariah, and the place which it is in is leased to him,\u201d and they each received rent one from another.","3852":"At minhah on the last festival day they would make the confession. How was the confession made? \u201cI have cleared out the holy portion from the house\u201d  this refers to maaser sheni and the fruit of plants in their fourth year. \u201cI have given them to the Levite\u201d   this refers to the tithe of the levites. \u201cAnd also I have given them\u201d   this refers to terumah and the terumah of tithe. \u201cTo the stranger, to the orphans, and to the widow\u201d  this refers to the tithe of the poor, gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and the corners of the field, even though these do not prevent   one from making the confession. \u201cOut of the house\u201d   this refers to hallah.","3853":"\u201cAccording to all Your commandments which You have commanded me,\u201d thus, if he took out maaser sheni before the first tithe he cannot make the confession. \u201cI have not transgressed any of Your commandments\u201d I have not set apart tithes from one kind for a different kind, nor from plucked produce for produce still joined to the soil, nor from new produce for old produce, nor from old produce for new. \u201cNeither have I forgotten\u201d   I have not forgotten to bless You, nor to make mention of You name over it.","3854":"\u201cI have not eaten from it in my mourning\u201d  thus, if he had eaten it in his mourning (aninut), he cannot make the confession. \u201cNeither have I removed any of it when unclean\u201d   thus, if he had removed it in uncleanness he cannot make the confession. \u201cAnd I have not given any of it to the dead\u201d  I have not used any of it for a coffin or shrouds for the dead, and I have not given any of it to other mourners. \u201cI have listened to the voice of the Lord my God\u201d   I have brought it to the chosen house. \u201cI have done just as you commanded me   I have rejoiced and made others rejoice.","3855":"\u201cLook down from Your holy abode, from heaven\u201d   We have done what You decreed upon us, You too do what You have promised us. \u201cLook down from Your holy abode, from heaven, and bless Your people Israel\u201d   with sons and daughters. \u201cAnd the land which You have given us\u201d   with dew and rain and with offspring of cattle. \u201cAs You swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey\u201d  that You may give a good taste to the produce.","3856":"From here they said that Israelites and mamzerim may make the confession, but not converts, nor freed slaves, since they have no inheritance in the land. Rabbi Meir says: neither do priests and Levites since they did not take a share of the land. Rabbi Yose says: they have the Levitical cities.","3857":"Yohanan the high priest stopped the recitation of the confession of the tithes. He also abolished the \u201cwakers\u201d and the \u201cstrikers.\u201d Until his days the hammer used to beat in Jerusalem. And in his days one did not have to ask about demai.","3858":"They said a general principle concerning tithes: whatever is food, and is looked after, and grows from the land, is liable for tithes. And they have further stated another general principle concerning tithes: whatever is considered food both at the beginning and at the conclusion of its growth even though he holds on to it in order to increase the quantity of food, is liable to tithe whether it is harvested in its earlier or later stages. But whatever is not considered food in the earlier stages of its growth but only in its later stages, is not liable to tithe until it can be considered food.","3859":"When do fruits become liable for tithes?Figs from the time they begin to ripe. Grapes and wild grapes in the early stages of ripening. Sumac and mulberries after they become red; similarly all red fruits, after they become red. Pomegranates, when the insides become soft. Dates when they begin to swell. Peaches when red veins begin to show. Walnuts when the nuts are separate from the shell. Rabbi Judah says: walnuts and almonds, after their inner skins have been formed.","3860":"Carobs are liable to tithes after they form dark spots; similarly all black fruits after they form dark spots. Pears and crustumenian pears, quinces, and medlars are liable to tithes after their surface begins to grow smooth; similarly all white fruits, after their surface begins to grow smooth. Fenugreek is liable to tithe when the seeds can be planted and will grow. Grain and olives after they are one-third ripe.","3861":"With regard to when vegetables are liable to tithes:Cucumbers, gourds, water-melons, cucumber-melons, apples and etrogs are liable for tithes, whether gathered in the earlier or later stages of ripening. Rabbi Shimon exempts the etrog in the earlier stages. The condition in which bitter almonds are liable to tithes is exempt in the case of sweet almonds, and the condition in which sweet almonds are liable to tithe is exempt in the case of bitter almonds.","3862":"What is considered a \u201cthreshing floor\u201d for tithes i.e. when does produce become liable for tithes?Cucumbers and gourds are liable for tithes once he removes their fuzz. And if he doesn\u2019t remove it, once he makes a pile. Melons once he removes the fuzz with hot water. And if they he does not remove the fuzz, once he stores them in the muktzeh. Vegetables which are tied in bundles, from the time he ties them up in bundles. If he does not tie them up in bundles, until he fills the vessel with them. And if he does not fill the vessel, after he has gathered all that he wishes to gather. Produce which is packed in a basket is liable for tithes after he has covered it. If he is not going to cover it, until he fills the vessel with them. And if he does not fill the vessel, after he has gathered all that he wishes to gather. When does this apply? When one brings the produce to the market. But when he brings it to his own house, he may make a chance meal of it, until he reaches his house.","3863":"Dried pomegranate seeds, raisins and carobs, are liable for tithes after he has made a pile. Onions, once he removes the onion seeds. If he does not remove the onion seeds, after he makes a pile. Grain, once he smoothes out the pile. If he does not smooth the pile, after he makes a pile. Pulse, after he has sifted it. If he does not sift, after he smoothes out a pile. Even after he has smoothed out the pile, he may without tithing take from the broken ears, from the sides of the piles, and from that which is mixed in with the chaff, and eat.","3864":"Wine is liable for tithes after it has been skimmed in the lower part of the winepress. Even though it has been skimmed, he may take from the upper winepress, or from the duct, and drink without taking out tithe. Oil is liable for tithes after it has gone down into the trough. But even after it has gone down into the trough he may still take oil from the pressing bale, or from the press beam, or from the boards between the press without tithing, And he may put such oil on a cake, or large plate. But he should not put the oil in a dish or stewpot, while they are boiling. Rabbi Judah says: he may put it into anything except that which contains vinegar or brine.","3865":"A cake of pressed figs is liable for tithes from the moment it has been smoothed out with fruit juice. They may smooth them out with the juice of untithed figs or grapes. Rabbi Judah forbids this. If one smoothed with grapes, it is not susceptible to uncleanness. Rabbi Judah says it is susceptible. Dried figs are liable to tithe after they have been pressed into a jar. And figs stored in a bin are liable to tithe after they have been pressed. If one was pressing the figs into a jar, or pressing them in a storage bin, and the jar was broken or the storage bin opened, he may not make a chance meal of them. Rabbi Yose permits this.","3866":"If one was passing through the street, and said \u201cTake for yourself from my figs,\u201d one may eat them and be exempt from tithes. Therefore if they brought them into their houses, they must separate tithes and terumah as if they were certainly untithed. If he said, \u201cTake and bring it into your houses,\u201d they may not make a chance meal of them. Therefore if they brought them into their houses, they need tithe them only as demai.","3867":"If they were sitting at the gate or a shop, and one said to them, \u201cTake for yourselves figs,\u201d they may eat and be exempt from tithes, but the owner of the gate, or the owner of the shop, is liable to give tithe. Rabbi Judah exempts him unless he turns his face or changes the place where he was sitting and selling.","3868":"One who brings produce from the Galilee to Judea, or if he goes up to Jerusalem, he may eat of them until he arrives at the place to which he intends to go, and the same is true when he returns. Rabbi Meir says: he may eat until he reaches the place where he intends to rest on Shabbat. But peddlers who travel from town to town may eat until they reach the place where they intend to stay over night. Rabbi Judah says: the first house he reaches is his house.","3869":"Produce from which he separated terumah before its work was finished: Rabbi Eliezer says: it is forbidden to make a chance meal of it, But the sages permit it except when it is a basket of figs. A basket of figs from which one separated terumah: Rabbi Shimon permits it. But the sages forbid it.","3870":"One who says to his friend: \u201cHere is this issar, give me five figs for it\u201d, he may not eat of them until he has tithed them, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah says: if he ate them one by one, he is exempt, but if he gathered them to eat them together, he is liable to tithe. Rabbi Judah said: it happened in a rose-garden in Jerusalem that there were figs being sold three or four for an issar, and neither terumah nor tithe was ever given from it.","3871":"One who says to his friend: \u201cHere is an issar for ten figs which I choose for myself,\u201d he may choose them and eat one at a time without tithing. If he said \u201cFor a cluster of grapes which I choose for myself,\u201d he may pick grapes from the cluster and eat. If he said, \u201cFor a pomegranate which I choose for myself,\u201d he may take apart the pomegranate and eat it one piece at a time. If he said \u201cFor a watermelon, which I choose for myself,\u201d he may slice and eat it one piece at a time.

If he said, \u201cOn condition that I and my son may eat,\u201d or \u201cthat my son may eat of them in lieu of my receiving a wage,\u201d he may eat and he is exempt from tithing, but his son may eat but he is liable for tithes. If he said, \u201cOn condition that I may eat of them during the time of the fig harvest, and after the fig harvest,\u201d during the time of the fig harvest he may eat and he is exempt from tithing, but if he eats after the fig harvest he is liable, since he does not eat of them in the manner mandated by the Torah. This is the general rule: one who eats in a manner mandated by the Torah is exempt from tithes, and one who does not eat in the manner mandated by the Torah is liable.","3873":"If a man is working as a hired worker among cooking figs, he may not eat of white figs, and if among white figs, he may not eat of cooking figs, but he may restrain himself until he reaches the place where there are the better figs, and then he may eat. If a man exchanges with his friend either figs for eating for figs for eating, or figs to be dried for figs to be dried, of figs for eating for figs to be dried, then he is liable to give tithes. Rabbi Judah says: one who exchanges figs for other figs for eating is liable, but if for figs for drying he is exempt.","3874":"One who was taking figs through his courtyard to be dried, his children and the other members of his household  may eat of them and they are exempt from tithes. The workers who work with him may eat and be exempt so long as he is not obliged to provide for them. If however, he is obligated to provide for them they may not eat.","3875":"One who brought his workers into the field, when he is not obligated to provide for them, they may eat and be exempt from tithes. If, however, he is obligated to provide for them they may eat of the figs one at a time, but not from the basket, nor from the large basket, nor from the storage yard.","3876":"One who hired a worker to work with olives and he said to him, \u201cOn condition that I may eat the olives,\u201d he may eat of them one at a time and be exempt from tithes. If, however, he gathered several together he is liable for tithes. If he had been hired to weed out onions, and he said to him, \u201cOn condition that I may eat the vegetables,\u201d he may pluck leaf by leaf, and eat without tithing. If, however, he gathered several together, he is liable for tithes.","3877":"If one found cut figs on the road, or even beside a field where cut figs have been spread to dry, and similarly, if a fig tree overhangs the road, and he found figs beneath it, they are allowed with regard to the laws of robbery, and they are exempt from tithe. But if they were olives and carobs, they are liable. If one found dried figs, then if the majority of people had already trodden their figs, he must tithe them, but if not he is exempt. If one found slices of fig-cake he is liable to tithe since it is obvious they come from something whose processing had been fully completed. With carobs, if they had not yet been on the top of the roof, he may take some down for his animals and be exempt from tithe since he returns that which is left over.","3878":"Which courtyard is it which makes the produce liable to tithe?Rabbi Ishmael says: the Tyrian yard for the vessels are protected therein. Rabbi Akiva says: any courtyard which one person may open and another may shut is exempt. Rabbi Nehemiah says: any courtyard in which a man is not ashamed to eat is liable. Rabbi Yose says: any courtyard into which a person may enter and no one says to him, \u201cwhat are you looking for\u201d is exempt. Rabbi Judah says: if there are two courtyards one within the other, the inner one makes liable and the outer one is exempt.","3879":"Roofs do not render produce liable, even though they belong to a courtyard which renders it liable. A gate house, portico, or balcony, are like the courtyard to which it belongs; if the courtyard makes the produce liable for tithes so do they, and if it does not, they do not.","3880":"Cone-shaped huts, watchtowers, and sheds in the field do not render produce liable. A sukkah-hut like those used in Ginnosar, even though it contains millstones and poultry, does not render produce liable. As for the potter\u2019s sukkah-hut, the inner part renders produce liable and the outer part does not. Rabbi Yose says: anything which is not both a sunny season and rainy season dwelling does not render produce liable to tithes. A sukkah used on the Festival of Sukkot: Rabbi Judah says: this renders produce liable for tithes But the sages exempt.","3881":"A fig tree which stands in a courtyard: one may eat the figs from it one at a time and be exempt from tithes, but if he gathered some together he is liable.

If he ascended to the top of it, he may fill his bosom and eat.","3882":"A vine which was planted in a courtyard: one may take a whole cluster and eat it without tithing. Similarly with a pomegranate, or a melon, the words of Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Akiva says: he can pick single berries from the cluster, or split the pomegranate into slices, or cut slices of melon and eat without tithing. Coriander which was sown in a courtyard: one may pluck leaf by leaf and eat without tithing, but if he ate them together he is liable for tithes. Savory and hyssop, and thyme which are in the courtyard, if they are kept watch over, they are liable for tithe.","3883":"A fig tree which stands in a courtyard, and hangs over into a garden: one may eat in his customary fashion and be exempt from tithes. If it stands in the garden and hangs over into the courtyard, one may eat the figs one at a time and be exempt, but if he gathers them together, he is liable for tithes. If it stands in the land of Israel and hangs over into the territory outside the land, or if it stands outside the land, and hangs over into the land, in all these cases the law is decided according to the position of the root. And as regards houses in walled cities, everything is decided according to the position of the root. But as regards cities of refuge, everything is decided also according to the location of the branches. And in what concerns Jerusalem, everything is decided by the location of the branches.","3884":"If he pickled, stewed, or salted produce, he is liable to give tithes. If he stored produce in the ground in order to warm it up he is exempt. If he dipped it while yet in the field, he is exempt.

In the case of a basket of fruits for Shabbat: Bet Shammai exempt it from tithes; But Bet Hillel makes it liable. Rabbi Judah says: even one who has gathered a basket of fruit to send as a present to his friend, must not eat of them, until they have been tithed.","3886":"One who took olives from a vat may dip them one at a time in salt, and eat them. But if he salted them, and put them in front of him, he is liable for tithes.

One who rubs ears of wheat may blow out the chaff of the wheat from hand to hand and eat, but if he blows and puts the grain in his lap he is liable. Coriander which was sown for the sake of the seed, the plant is exempt from tithes. If he sowed it for the sake of the plant then both the seed and the plant must be tithed. Rabbi Eliezer said: as for dill, tithe must be given from the seed and the plant, and the pods. But the sages say: only in the case of cress and eruca are both the seeds and plant tithed.","3889":"Rabban Gamaliel says: shoots of fenugreek, of mustard, and of white beans are liable to tithe. Rabbi Eliezer says: as for the caper bush, tithes must be given from the shoots, the berries and the blossoms.

If onions take root in an upper story they become clean from any impurity. If some debris fell upon them and they are uncovered, they are regarded as though they were planted in the field.","3892":"One may not sell produce after the season for tithing has arrived to one who is not trusted concerning tithes. Nor in the sabbatical year may one sell sabbatical year produce to one suspected of transgressing the sabbatical year. If only some produce ripened, he takes the ripe ones and may sell the remainder.","3893":"One may not sell his straw, nor his olive peat, or his grape pulp to one who is not to be trusted in with respect to tithes, for him to extract the juice from them.

Rabbi Judah Hanasi says: he must also tithe according to calculation.","3895":"One who makes grape-skin wine, and he put water on by measure, and he finds afterwards the same quantity, he is exempt from tithe. Rabbi Judah makes him liable. If he found more than the measure, he must give tithe for it from another place, in proportion.","3896":"Anthills which have remained the whole night near a pile of grain which was liable to tithe,   the grain found in them is liable, since it is obvious that they the ants have been dragging away the whole night from something of which the work had been completed.","3897":"Garlic from Balbeck, onions from Rikpa, Cicilician beans and Egyptians lentils, and Rabbi Meir says qirqas, and Rabbi Yose says qotnym are exempt from tithes and may be brought from any man in the seventh year. The seeds of upper arum pods, the seeds of leeks, the seeds of onions, the seeds of turnips and radishes, and other seeds of garden produce which are not eaten, are exempt from tithes, and may be bought from any man in the seventh year; and even though the plants from they grew were terumah, they may still be eaten by non-priests.","3898":"One who plants a fruit tree as a fence or to provide wood beams, it is exempt from the law of orlah. Rabbi Yose says: even if he said \u201cThe inward facing part of the tree is for food, and the outward facing part is for a fence,\u201d the inward facing part is subject to orlah, and the outward facing part is exempt.","3899":"If at the time when our ancestors came into the land and they found a tree already planted it was exempt from the laws of orlah. If they planted a tree, even though they had not yet conquered the land, it was subject to orlah. If one planted a tree for the use of the many, it is subject. But Rabbi Judah makes it exempt. If one has planted a tree in the public domain, or if a non-Jew has planted, or if a robber has planted, or one who plants on a boat, or a tree that has grown of itself, it is subject to orlah.","3900":"If a tree was uprooted and the hard soil together with it, or if a stream swept it away and the hard soil together with it, then if it could have lived it is exempt, But if it could not, it is subject. If the hard soil has been detached from its side, or if a ploughshare shook it, or if someone shook it, and one reset it with earth, then if it could have lived, it is exempt, But if not, it is subject.","3901":"If a tree was uprooted and one root was left in the ground, it is exempt. How much must the thickness of the root be? Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said in the name of Rabb Eliezer ben Judah a man of Bartota:  as thick as a pin used for stretching.","3902":"A tree which was uprooted and it has a bent-down and rooted shoot, and it the tree derives sustenance from it the shoot, the old tree is considered like the shoot. If one bends and roots from it year after year, and it became detached, one counts from the time it became detached. A grafted shoot of vines, and a grafted shoot growing on another grafted shoot, even if he rooted them in the soil, they are permitted. Rabbi Meir said: in an instance where it is strongly grafted, it is permitted, but in an instance where it is poorly grafted, it is prohibited. A bent-down and rooted shoot that has become detached and is full of fruit, then if it increased one two hundredth, it is prohibited.","3903":"If a shoot of orlah or a vineyard in which seeds had been planted (kilayim), became mixed up with other shoots, behold one may not gather the fruit. But if one has gathered it, it is neutralized in two hundred-and-one, provided that he did not act deliberately. Rabbi Yose says: even if he acted deliberately, it becomes neutralized in two hundred-and-one.","3904":"Leaves, sprouts, sap of vines, and vine-buds are permitted in respect of orlah and the laws of the fourth year, and to a nazirite, but are prohibited if they come from an Asherah tree. Rabbi Yose says: vine-buds are prohibited because they are fruit. Rabbi Eliezer said: if one curdles milk with the resinous substances of a tree liable to orlah, it is prohibited. Rabbi Joshua said: I have received an explicit tradition that if one curdles milk with the resinous substance of the leaves, or with the resinous substance of the roots, it is permitted, but with the resinous substance of the unripe berries, it is prohibited, because these are fruit.","3905":"Defective grapes, grape kernels, grape husks, and the temed drink made from them, the peel of a pomegranate and its sprout, nutshells, and fruit-seeds, are all subject to the laws of orlah, asherah and a nazirite, but permitted in respect of a fourth year vineyard. Fallen unripe fruit is subject to all of them.","3906":"Rabbi Yose says: one may plant a shoot of orlah; But one may not plant a nut of orlah, because it is fruit. And one may not graft early date berries of orlah.","3907":"Terumah, terumat maaser of demai, hallah and bikkurim, are neutralized in a hundred-and-one mixture. And they are reckoned together to form the statutory minimum. And it is necessary to remove from the mixture an amount equal to that of the consecrated produce contained in it. Orlah and kilayim of the vineyard are neutralized in a two-hundred-and-one mixture. And they are reckoned together to form the statutory minimum. But it is not necessary to remove from the mixture an amount equal to that of the consecrated produce contained in it. Rabbi Shimon says: they are not reckoned together. Rabbi Eliezer says: they are reckoned together when they impart flavor, but not to prohibit.","3908":"Terumah can void orlah, and orlah can void terumah. How so? For instance a seah of terumah fell into one hundred, and afterwards three kavs of orlah or three kavs of mixed-seeds of the vineyard fell in. This is an instance where terumah goes towards neutralizing orlah, and orlah terumah.","3909":"Orlah can void kilayim, and kilayim can void orlah, and orlah can void orlah. How so? A seah of orlah falls into two hundred seahs and afterwards there falls in a seah and a little bit more of orlah, or a seah and a little bit more of kilayim of the vineyard--this is a case where orlah can void kilayim, and kilayim can void orlah, and orlah can void orlah.","3910":"Whatever causes something to ferment, or seasons, or makes medumma with terumah, with orlah or with \u2018mixed-seeds\u2019 of the vineyard, is prohibited.

He may take from the threshing floor and use it as seed and be exempt from giving tithes until he makes a stack, the words of Rabbi Akiva. A priest or Levite who purchase grain of a threshing floor, the tithes are theirs unless the owner has already made a stack.

If he plants it of two kinds, even though he makes up of it one threshing-floor, he must give two peahs. One who plants his field with two species of wheat: If he makes up of it one threshing-floor, he gives only one peah; But if two threshing-floors, he gives two peahs.","3944":"It happened that Rabbi Shimon of Mitzpah planted his field with two different kinds and came before Rabban Gamaliel.

The same applies to beans and to a vineyard. If he, however, he only thins it out, then he gives peah from the remainder according to the quantity of that which he left. But if he clears three from one place at one time, he gives from the remainder according to the entire quantity.","3950":"Onions grown for their seed are liable for peah. But Rabbi Yose exempts them. Plots of onions growing between vegetables: Rabbi Yose says: peah must be given from each plot. But the sages say: from one plot for all.","3951":"Two brothers who divided an inheritance must give two peahs. If they afterwards again become partners they give one peah. Two who purchase a tree, they give one peah. If one buys the northern section of the tree and the other the southern section, each must give peah separately. One who sells young saplings in his field, the one who purchases must give peah from each sapling. Rabbi Judah said: When is this so? When the owner of the field left nothing for himself.  But if he did leave something for himself, he gives one peah for the whole.","3952":"Rabbi Eliezer says: a piece of ground large enough to plant one fourth of a kav is liable for peah. Rabbi Joshua says: it must be large enough to grow two seahs. Rabbi Tarfon says:  it must be six by six handbreadths. R. Judah ben Batera says: it must be large enough for a sickle to cut at least two handfuls and the halakhah is according to his words. Rabbi Akiva says: any size of land is liable for peah and for first-fruits, and is sufficient for the writing of the prozbul, and also to acquire through it movable property by money, by deed, or by a claim based on undisturbed possession.","3953":"One who is about to die who assigns his property in writing to another: If he retains any land for himself however small, he renders his gift valid. But if he retains no land whatsoever, his gift is not valid. One who assigns in writing his property to his children, and he assigns to his wife in writing any plot of land, however small, she lost her ketubah. Rabbi Yose says: if she accepted such an assignment even though he did not assign it to her in writing she lost her ketubah.","3954":"One who assigns in writing his possessions to his slave, the slave thereby goes free.

But in the case of hanging vine-branches and the date-palm, the owner brings down the fruit and distributes it among the poor. Rabbi Shimon says: the same applies to smooth nut trees. Even if ninety-nine of the poor say to the owner to distribute it and one says to leave it in the field, this latter is listened to, since he spoke in accordance with the halakhah.","3956":"With hanging vine-branches and date-palm trees it is not so; even if ninety-nine of the poor say to the owner to leave it in the field and one says to distribute it, this latter is listened to, since he spoke in accordance with the halakhah.","3957":"If a poor man took some of the peah already collected and threw it onto the remainder not yet collected, he gets none of it.

Rabban Gamaliel says: these times were only set lest they reduce them. Rabbi Akiva says: these were set lest they add to them. The men of Bet Namer used to have the poor harvest the peah with the aid of a rope,   and they left peah at the end of each furrow.","3960":"A non-Jew who harvested his field and then converted, he is exempt from leaving gleanings, the forgotten sheaf and peah. Rabbi Judah makes him liable to leave the forgotten sheaf, since he becomes liable for the forgotten sheaf at the time of their binding.","3961":"One who dedicated standing grain to the Temple and then redeemed it while it was still standing grain, he is liable to give the agricultural gifts to the poor. If he dedicated sheaves and redeemed them while they were still sheaves, he is liable.

That which falls down at the time of harvesting. If while he was harvesting, he harvested a handful, or plucked a fistful, and then a thorn pricked him, and what he had in his hand fell to the ground, it still belongs to the owner. That which drops from inside the hand or the sickle belongs to the poor, but that which falls from the back of the hand or the sickle belongs to the owner. That which falls from the top of the hand or sickle: Rabbi Ishmael says: to the poor; But Rabbi Akiva says: to the owner.","3965":"Grain found in ant holes where the stalks are still standing, behold it still belongs to the owner. After the harvesters had passed over them, those found in the top parts of the ant holes belong to the poor, but those found on the bottom parts belong to the owner. Rabbi Meir says: it all belongs to the poor, for gleanings about which there is any doubt are regarded as gleanings.","3966":"If a pile of grain was stacked on part of a field from which gleanings had not yet been collected, whatever touches the ground belongs to the poor. If the wind scattered the sheaves, they estimate the amount of gleanings the field would have yielded and they give that to the poor. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: he must give to the poor the amount that would fall.","3967":"The top of a single ear of grain that remained after the harvesting and its top touches the standing stalk: If it can be cut with the stalk, it belongs to the owner; But if not, it belongs to the poor. If an ear of grain of gleanings that became mixed up with a stack of grain, the owner must tithe one ear of grain and give it to him the poor. Rabbi Eliezer says: how can this poor man give in exchange something that had not yet become his?  Rather, the owner must transfer to the poor man the ownership of the whole stack and then tithe one ear of grain and give it to him.","3968":"They should not irrigate a field with a water wheel, the words of Rabbi Meir. The sages permit it, because it is still possible for the poor to get their gleanings.","3969":"A property owner who was passing from place to place and need to take gleanings, the forgotten sheaf, peah or the poor man\u2019s tithe, he may take them, and when he returns home, he must pay for the amount gathere, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. The sages say: he was a poor man at that time and so he need not make restitution.","3970":"One who exchanges with the poor, what they give in exchange for his is exempt from tithes but what he gives in exchange for that of the poor is subject to tithes. Two who received a field as sharecroppers, this one may give to the other his share of the poor man\u2019s tithe and this one may give to the other his share of the poor man\u2019s tithe. One who receives a field in order to harvest it, he is forbidden to take gleanings, the forgotten sheaf, peah or the poor man\u2019s tithe. Rabbi Judah said: When is this so? When he receives it in order to pay the owner a half, third or quarter of the crop.  But if the owner had said to him: \u201cA third of that which you harvest belongs to you,\u201d then he may take gleanings, the forgotten sheaf and peah, but not the poor man\u2019s tithe.","3971":"One who sells, the seller is permitted to take the agricultural gifts and the purchaser is forbidden. One may not hire a worker on the condition that the son of the worker should gather the gleanings after him. One who does not allow the poor to gather, or one who allows one but not another, or one who helps one of them to gather behold he is a robber of the poor.   Concerning him it is said: \u201cDo not remove the landmark of those that come up (olim)\u201d (Proverbs 22:28).","3972":"A sheaf which the workers forgot but not the land owner, or which the land owner forgot but not the workers; or a sheaf which the poor stood in front of and blocked its view, or they covered it up with stubble, it is not considered a forgotten sheaf.","3973":"One who binds sheaves into stack covers, stack bases, round stacks or regular stacks, he is not subject to the law of the forgotten sheaf while binding. When bringing them afterwards to the threshing-floor, he is subject to the law of the forgotten sheaf. One who piles up the sheaves to make a stack, he is subject to the law of the forgotten sheaf. When bringing them afterwards to the threshing-floor, he is not subject to the law of the forgotten sheaf. This is the general rule: whoever makes the sheaves at the place which is the end of the work is subject to the law of the forgotten sheaf, and afterwards when he takes them to the threshing-floor, he is not subject to the law of the forgotten sheaf. However, one who piles up the sheaves at a place which is not the end of the work, is not subject to the law of the forgotten sheaf; and afterwards when he takes them to the threshing-floor, he is subject to the law of the forgotten sheaf.","3974":"Bet Shammai says: That which is made ownerless only in regard to the poor is indeed ownerless. But Bet Hillel says: it is not ownerless unless ownership is renounced even for the rich, as in the case of the sabbatical year. If all of the sheaves in a field are a kav each, and one is four kavs and that one is forgotten: Bet Shammai says: it is not considered forgotten. But Bet Hillel says: it is considered forgotten.","3975":"A sheaf left near a stone fence, or near a stack of grain or near oxen, or near equipment: Bet Shammai says: it is not considered \u201cforgotten\u201d; Bet Hillel says: it is considered \u201cforgotten.\u201d","3976":"With regard to sheaves forgotten at the end of the row, the sheaf lying across from it proves that the first sheaf has not been forgotten. As for a sheaf that the owner took to bring it to the city and forgot it, all agree that it is not considered a \u201cforgotten sheaf.\u201d","3977":"These are to be considered ends of the rows:If two men begin to gather from the middle of the row, one facing north and the other south and they forget some sheaves in front of them and behind them, those left in front of them are \u201cforgotten,\u201d but those left behind them are not \u201cforgotten.\u201d If an individual begins from the end of the row and he forgets some sheaves in front of him and behind him, those in front of him are not \u201cforgotten\u201d, whereas those behind him are \u201cforgotten,\u201d for this comes under the category of \u201cyou shall not go back to retrieve it.\u201d This is the general rule: anything that can be said to fall under the law \u201cyou shall not go back\u201d is considered \u201cforgotten,\u201d but that to which the principle of \u201cyou shall not go back\u201d cannot be applied is not considered \u201cforgotten.\u201d","3978":"Two sheaves left lying together are \u201cforgotten,\u201d but three are not \u201cforgotten.\u201d Two bundles of olives or carobs are \u201cforgotten\u201d but three are not \u201cforgotten.\u201d Two flax-stalks are \u201cforgotten\u201d, but three are not \u201cforgotten\u201d.

And concerning them all Bet Shammai says that three that are left belong to the poor, and four belong to the owner.","3979":"A sheaf that has two seahs and he forgot it  it is not considered \u201cforgotten.\u201d Two sheaves that together comprise two seahs: Rabban Gamaliel says: they belong to the owner; But the sages say: they belong to the poor. Rabban Gamaliel said: \u201cAre the rights of the owner strengthened or weakened according to the greater number of the sheaves?\u201d They replied, \u201cHis rights are strengthened.\u201d He said to them: \u201cIf in a case of one sheaf of two seahs it is not deemed \u201cforgotten,\u201d then how much more should be the case of two sheaves that together contain two seahs?\u201d They replied: \u201cNo. If you argue in the case of one sheaf it is because it is large enough to be considered a stack. Are you going to argue likewise in the case of two sheaves which are like bundles?\u201d","3980":"A standing stalk of grain that contains two seahs and he forgot it, it is not considered \u201cforgotten.\u201d If it does not contain two seahs now, but is fit to yield two seahs, even if it was of an inferior kind of barley, it is regarded as full barley grains.","3981":"A standing stalk of grain can save a sheaf and another standing stalk from being regarded as \u201cforgotten\u201d. A sheaf cannot save either another sheaf or a standing stalk. What is the standing stalk of grain that can save a sheaf? Anything which has not been forgotten, even though it is a single stalk.","3982":"A seah of plucked grain and a seah of unplucked grain, and also trees; and garlic and to onions do not combine to count as two seahs, but rather they must be left to the poor. Rabbi Yose says: if anything that belongs to the poor comes in between them, the two are not combined together; otherwise, they do combine.","3983":"Grain used for fodder or stalks used for binding sheaves, and also garlic-stalks used for tying other bunches, or tied bunches of garlic and onions they all are not subject to the laws of forgotten. Anything stored in the ground like arum, garlic and onions: Rabbi Judah says: they do not subject to the laws of \u201cforgotten\u201d; But the sages say: they are subject to the laws of \u201cforgotten.\u201d","3984":"One who harvests by night and binds sheaves by night or one who is blind that which he leaves is subject to the law of the \u201cforgotten.\u201d If he intends to remove large leaves first, then the law of \u201cforgotten\u201d does not apply. If he said: \u201cBehold, I am reaping on the condition that I take afterwards that which I have forgotten,\u201d the law of \u201cforgotten\u201d still applies.","3985":"An olive tree that has a name in the field, such as the olive tree of Netofah in its time, and he forgot it, it is not deemed \u201cforgotten.\u201d To what does this apply? Only to a tree distinguished by its name, produce, or position. \u201cBy its name:\u201d if it were a shifkhoni  or beshani. \u201cBy its produce:\u201d if it yields large quantities. \u201cBy its position:\u201d if it stands at the side of the winepress or near the gap in the fence. Other kinds of olive trees:  two are deemed \u201cforgotten\u201d, but three are not deemed \u201cforgotten.\u201d Rabbi Yose says: there is no law of \u201cforgotten\u201d for olive trees.","3986":"An olive tree found standing between three rows of olive trees which have two plots separating them, and he forgot it, it is deemed, \u201cforgotten.\u201d An olive tree containing two seahs and he forgot it, it is not deemed forgotten. To what does this apply? Only when he the owner had not yet begun to harvest the tree, but if he had begun, even if it were like the olive tree of Netofah in its time, and he forgot it, it is deemed forgotten. As long as the owner has some of the olives belonging to him at the foot of the tree, he has possession of those on top of the tree. Rabbi Meir says: forgotten applies only after those with the beating-rod have gone.","3987":"What is peret? Grapes which fall down during the harvesting. If while he was harvesting the grapes, he cut off an entire cluster by its stalk, and it got tangled up in the grape leaves, and then it fell from his hand to the ground and the single berries were separated, it belongs to the owner. One who places a basket under the vine when he is harvesting the grapes, behold he is a robber of the poor.   Concerning him it is said: \u201cDo not remove the landmark of those that come up (olim)\u201d (Proverbs 22:28).","3988":"What constitutes a defective cluster of grapes? Any cluster which has neither a shoulder a wide upper part nor a pendant a cone-shaped lower part. If it has a shoulder or a pendant, it belongs to the owner. If there is a doubt, it belongs to the poor. A defective cluster on the joint of a vine where a normal cluster hangs from the vine, if it can be cut off with the cluster, it belongs to the owner; but if it can not, it belongs to the poor. A single grape: Rabbi Judah says: It is deemed a whole cluster, But the sages say: It is deemed a defective cluster.","3989":"One who is thinning out vines, just as he may thin out in that which belongs to him, so too he may thin out in that which belongs to the poor, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Meir says: in that which belongs to him, he is permitted, but he is not permitted in that which belongs to the poor.","3990":"The grapes of a vineyard in its fourth year:Bet Shammai says: the laws of the added fifth and removal do not apply to them; But Bet Hillel says: they do. Bet Shammai says: the laws of peret and the defective clusters apply to them, and the poor can redeem the grapes for themselves. But Bet Hillel says: all of them go to the wine-press.","3991":"A vineyard which consists entirely of defective clusters: Rabbi Eliezer says: it belongs to the owner. Rabbi Akiva says: to the poor. Rabbi Eliezer: \u201cWhen you harvest the grapes of your vineyard, do not take the defective clusters\u201d even if it consists entirely of defective clusters. If that is so, why is it said: \u201cWhen you harvest the grapes of your vineyard, do not take the defective clusters\u201d? This teaches that the poor have no right to claim the defective clusters before the harvest.","3992":"One who dedicates his entire vineyard to the Temple before the \u201cdefective clusters\u201d were recognizable, the \u201cdefective clusters\u201d do not belong to the poor. After the defective clusters were recognizable, then they do belong to the poor. Rabbi Yose says: the poor must give the value of their improved growth to the Temple. What is deemed \u201cforgotten\u201d in the case of a trellis a lattice for supporting plants? Anything that one can no longer stretch his hand and take it. And in the case of ground-trained vines? From the time the gatherers pass by it.","3993":"From when are all people permitted to take gleanings, forgotten sheaves and peah? After the old ones of the poor have gone. And in the case of peret and defective clusters? After the poor have gone into the vineyard and come back again. And in the case of the olive trees? After the descent of the second rainfall. Rabbi Judah said: But aren\u2019t there those who do not harvest their olives until after the second rainfall?\u201d Rather, once the poor man has gone out to gather the agricultural gifts taken from olive trees and cannot bring back with him more than the value of four issars.","3994":"They amei haaretz are to be believed concerning gleanings, the forgotten sheaf and peah during their harvest season, and concerning the poor man\u2019s tithe during its whole year. A Levite is always to be trusted. They are only believed in those things which men are accustomed to give them.","3995":"They are trusted concerning wheat, but they are not trusted when it is flour or bread. They are trusted concerning rice in its husk, but they are not trusted when it is either raw or cooked. They are trusted concerning beans but they are not trusted when they have been pounded, neither raw nor cooked. They are trusted when concerning oil, to declare that it is from the poor person\u2019s tithe, but they are not trusted over oil when they claim that it is from the olives left on the top of the tree.","3996":"They are trusted concerning raw vegetables, but they are not trusted concerning are cooked ones, unless he has only a little bit, for so it was the custom of a householder to take out of his stew-pot and give a little to the poor.","3997":"They may not give to the poor from the threshing-floor less than a half-kav of wheat or a kav of barley. R. Meir says: only half a kav of barley. They must give a kav and a half of spelt, a kav of dried figs or a maneh of pressed figs. Rabbi Akiva says: half a maneh. They must give half a log of wine. Rabbi Akiva says: a quarter. They must give a quarter log of oil. Rabbi Akiva says: an eighth. As for other kinds of produce:  Abba Shaul says, they must give enough so that he can sell it and buy food enough for two meals.","3998":"This measure was stated for the priest, Levite and Israelite alike. If he was saving some to give to his poor relatives, he can retain half and give the other half away. If he has only a small amount, then he must place it before them and they then divide it among themselves.","3999":"They may not give a poor person wandering from place to place less than a loaf worth a pundion at a time when four seahs of wheat cost one sela. If he spends the night at a place, they must give him the cost of what he needs for the night. If he stays over Shabbat they must give him enough food for three meals. He who has the money for two meals, he may not take anything from the charity dish. And if he has enough money for fourteen meals, he may not take any support from the communal fund. The communal fund is collected by two and distributed by three people.","4000":"One who possesses two hundred zuz, may not take gleanings\u201d the forgotten sheaf, peah or the poor man\u2019s tithe. If he possesses two hundred minus one denar, then even if a thousand men each give him at the same time, he may accept. If he had two hundred zuz mortgaged to a creditor or to his wife\u2019s ketubah, he may take. They do not force him to sell his house or his tools.","4001":"One who has fifty zuz and he is using them for his business, he must not take. And anyone who does not need to take charity and yet takes, will not depart from this world before he actually needs charity from others. And anyone who needs to take and does not take, will not die of old age until he supports others with his own money. Concerning him the verse says: \u201cBlessed is the man who trusts in the Lord and whose hope is the Lord\u201d and it is also said: \u201cRighteousness, righteousness shall you pursue.\u201d And any judge who accepts a bribe or who perverts justice will not die in old age before his eyes have become dim, as it is said: \u201cAnd you shall not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of those who have sight.\u201d","4002":"Until when may they plow an orchard in the sixth year? Bet Shammai say: as long as such work will benefit the fruit. And Bet Hillel says: till Atzeret (Shavuot). The views of this school are close to those of the other.","4003":"What constitutes an orchard? Any field in which there are at least three trees for every bet seah. If each tree is capable of yielding a cake of pressed figs, the size of sixty in the Italian maneh, then the entire bet seah may be plowed for their sake. If less than this amount, they may only plow the area that is occupied by the gatherer when his basket is placed behind him.","4004":"Whether they are fruit-bearing trees or non-fruit-bearing trees, we treat them as if they were fig-trees. If they are capable of yielding a cake of pressed figs, the size of sixty in the Italian maneh, then the entire bet seah may be plowed for their sake. If less than this amount, they may plow them only for their own needs.","4005":"If one of the trees was capable of bearing a cake of dried figs weighing sixty manehs, and the other two unable; or, if two could do so, but one cannot, then they may plow them only for their own needs. This is the rule if the number of trees is from three to nine, but if there were ten trees or more, whether they produce the requisite amount of fruit or not the whole bet seah may be plowed on their account. As it says: \u201cIn plowing and in harvesting, you shall rest\u201d (Ex 34:21). It was unnecessary to state plowing and harvesting in the seventh year, rather what it means is the plowing of the year preceding which encroaches on the sabbatical year, and the harvest of the seventh year which extends into the year after. Rabbi Ishmael says: just as plowing is an optional act, so harvesting referred to in the verse is optional, thus excluding the harvesting of the omer which is obligatory.","4006":"Three trees belonging to three persons, they join together and they may plow the entire bet seah on their account. What space should there be between them? Rabban Gamaliel says: sufficient for the driver of the herd to pass through with his implements.","4007":"If ten saplings are scattered over the entire area of a bet seah, they may plow the whole bet seah, even until Rosh Hashanah. But if they were arranged in a row or they were surrounded by a fence, they may plow them only for their own needs.","4008":"Saplings and gourds are counted together within space of a bet seah. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: if there are ten gourds in the bet seah they may plow the whole bet seah until Rosh Hashanah.","4009":"Up until when are they called saplings? Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says: until they are permitted for common use. But Rabbi Joshua says: until they are seven years old. Rabbi Akiba says: the word sapling, it goes according to its name. A tree which had been cut down and then produced fresh shoots: if one handbreadth or less, they are regarded as saplings, if more than a handbreadth they are regarded as trees, the words of Rabbi Shimon.","4010":"Until when may they plow a white field in the sixth year? Until the moisture has dried up in the soil, or as long as men still plow in order to plant cucumbers and gourds. Rabbi Shimon said: in that case you are placing the law in the hands of each man!  Rather in the case of a white field until Pesah, and in the case of an orchard until Atzeret (Shavuot).","4011":"They may manure and hoe cucumbers and gourds until Rosh Hashanah. So too with regard to irrigated fields. They may remove flaws from trees, strip off leaves, cover roots with earth, and fumigate the plants until Rosh Hashanah. Rabbi Shimon says: one may also remove leaves from a grape cluster even in the seventh year itself.","4012":"They may clear away stones until Rosh Hashanah. They may trim, prune and remove excess parts of the tree until Rosh Hashanah. Rabbi Joshua says: just as one may trim and remove in the fifth year so too may one perform this work in the sixth year. Rabbi Shimon says: as long as I may legally tend the tree itself, I may remove excess parts of it.","4013":"They may besmear saplings, wrap them around, and trim them, and they may make for them shelters and water them until Rosh Hashanah. Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says: he may even water the foliage on the sabbatical year, but not the roots.","4014":"They may oil unripe figs and pierce them until Rosh Hashanah. Unripe figs of the sixth year which have remained on the tree until the seventh year, or of the seventh year which have remained on the tree until the eighth year, they may not oil them or pierce them. Rabbi Judah says: In a place where it was the custom to oil, one may not oil them, since that would be considered work; but in a place where it was not the custom to oil, they may oil them. Rabbi Shimon permitted in connection with the tree, because he is permitted to do all work for the tree.","4015":"They may not plant or graft, or sink vine-shoots in the sixth year within thirty days of Rosh Hashanah. If he has planted or grafted, he must uproot. Rabbi Judah says: any grafting that has not taken root within three days will never do so. Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon say: two weeks.","4016":"Rice, millet, poppy and sesame that had taken root before Rosh Hashanah must be tithed   according to the previous year, and are permissible in the seventh year. If they did not then they are forbidden in the seventh year, and are tithed according to the year following.","4017":"Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: Egyptian beans which he sowed for seed only, are like them. Rabbi Shimon says: large beans, are also like them. But Rabbi Elazar says: large beans, if they began to form pods before Rosh Hashanah.","4018":"Seedless onions and Egyptian beans from which he withheld water for thirty days prior to Rosh Hashanah are tithed with the preceding year, and are permitted in the seventh year. And if not, they are forbidden in the seventh, and are tithed according to the following year. And seedless onions and Egyptian beans grown in a rain-irrigated field from which two periods of rain have been withheld, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: three.","4019":"Gourds which he had kept in the ground for seed: if they had hardened before Rosh Hashanah and had become unfit for human food, they may be kept during the seventh year; otherwise, they must not be kept in the seventh year. Their buds are forbidden in the seventh year. They may irrigate the soil of a white field (a grain field), the words of Rabbi Shimon. But Rabbi Elazar ben Jacob prohibits. They may soak the rice in the sabbatical year. Rabbi Shimon says: but they may not be trim the rice.","4020":"From when may they bring out manure to the dung-heaps?From when the workers have ceased to work, the words of Rabbi Meir. But Rabbi Judah says:  until the sweetness of the manure has dried up. Rabbi Yose says: until the dung dries into knots.","4021":"How much manure may they take out and make into dung-heaps? Three dung-heaps for every bet seah, each consisting of ten baskets of foliage of a letekh each. They may add to the number of baskets, but not to the number of heaps. Rabbi Shimon says: also to the number of heaps.","4022":"A man may deposit in his field three dung-heaps for every bet seah and even more, the words of Rabbi Shimon. The sages forbid unless he deposits them three handbreadths below or thee handbreadths above. A man may pile up all the manure into one large store. Rabbi Meir forbids unless he deposits them three handbreadths below or thee handbreadths above. If he had just a little, he may constantly add to it. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah forbids unless he deposits them three handbreadths below or thee handbreadths above.","4023":"One who uses his field as a pen for cattle, he first makes an enclosure for every two bet se'ahs.  He then uproots three sides, and leaves the middle side.  It turns out that he has made a pen of four seahs. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: one of eight seahs. If his entire field is only four seahs in area, he must allow a portion of it to remain unenclosed for appearance's sake. And he may take the dung out from the enclosure, and spread across his field in the manner of those who fertilize their fields.","4024":"A man may not open a stone quarry within his field for the first time, unless there are in it three layers, each three cubits long, three wide and three high, for a total of twenty-seven stones.","4025":"A wall that consists of ten stones, each a load for two men, may be removed, if the measurement of this wall is at least ten handbreadths high. Less than that he quarries it and he may lower it to within one handbreadth of the ground. When is this so? From his own field, but from that of another, he may remove whatever he wishes. When is this so? When he did not begin to remove the stones in the sixth year, but if he began in the sixth year, he may remove whatever he wishes.","4026":"Stones which the plow has turned up, or which had been covered and became uncovered, if there are among them at least two, each the load of two men, they may be removed. One who removes stones from his field, he removes the top layers, but he leave those touching the ground. And likewise a heap of pebbles, or a pile of stones; he may remove the top layers but must leave those touching the ground. If, however, there is beneath them rocky soil or stubble, they may be removed.","4027":"They may not build steps leading to ravines in the sixth year after the rains have stopped, for this would be improving the fields for the seventh year. But he may build in the seventh year itself, after the rains have stopped, for this would be a improving the fields for the eighth year. He may not block them the steps with earth, but he may make an embankment. Any stone which he can stick out his hand and pick up, may be removed.","4028":"Shoulder-stones may be removed from any place. And the contractor may bring them from anywhere. Which are shoulder-stones? Any one that cannot be picked up with one hand, the words of Rabbi Meir. But Rabbi Yose says: the name is to be taken literally; those that are carried on a man\u2019s shoulder, either two or three at a time.","4029":"One who makes a fence between his own property and the public domain, he is allowed to dig down to rock level. What should he do with the soil? He piles it up in the public domain, and then restores it, the words of Rabbi Joshua. Rabbi Akiva says: just as no damage may be done to a public domain, so one may not repair it.  Then what should he do with the soil? He heaps it up in his own field in the manner of those who bring out dung for manure. Similarly when one digs a cistern, a trench or a cave.","4030":"At first they said: a man may gather wood, stones and grasses from his field, just as he was allowed to do from the field of his fellow, the large ones. When the transgressors increased, they decreed that this one may gather from this one\u2019s field and this one may gather from this one\u2019s field, but not as a mutual favor. It doesn\u2019t need to be said that no stipulation can be made for food.","4031":"A field from which thorns had been removed may be sown in the eighth year. But if it had been improved upon, or cattle had been allowed to live upon it, it may not be sown in the eighth year. A field which had been improved upon in the seventh year: Bet Shammai says: they may not eat its produce in the seventh year, But Bet Hillel says: they may eat. Bet Shammai says: they may not eat produce of the sabbatical year with an expression of thanks. But Bet Hillel says: they may eat sabbatical year produce with an expression for thanks and without an expression of thanks. Rabbi Judah says: the statements must be reversed, for this is one of the instances where Bet Shammai is lenient and Bet Hillel is stringent.","4032":"They may rent newly plowed land from a Gentile in the seventh year, but not from an Israelite. And they may encourage Gentiles during the seventh year, but not Israelites. They may exchange greetings with them because of the ways of peace.","4033":"One who thins out his olive-trees in the seventh year: Bet Shammai says: he cuts them down to the ground. Bet Hillel says: he may completely uproot them. They agree that if one levels his field, he can only cut them down to the ground. What is considered \u201cthinning out\u201d?  One or two plants. And what is considered \u201cleveling\u201d?   Three plants next to each other. This applies to his own property only, but from the property of another, even he that levels may uproot.","4034":"One who cuts down branches of an olive tree, he may not cover up the stump with earth, but he may cover it with stones or straw. One who cuts down branches of a sycamore tree, he may not cover up the stump with earth, but he may cover it with stones or straw. One may not cut down from a virgin sycamore in the seventh year, for this would constitute actual labor. Rabbi Judah says: in its usual manner, it is forbidden. Rather he either cuts it ten handbreadths above the soil, or he cuts it down to ground level.","4035":"One who trims grape vines, or cuts reeds: Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: he must leave uncut at least one handbreadth. But Rabbi Akiba says: he may cut them in the usual manner, with the axe, sickle or saw, or with whatever he pleases. A tree that had split may be tied up in the seventh year, not that it may heal, but only that it should not widen.","4036":"From when may one begin to eat of the fruit of the trees in the seventh year? With unripe figs as soon as they assume a rosy appearance, one may eat them in the field with his bread. Once they have begun to ripen, he may take them home. And similarly in the other years of the sabbatical cycle when this latter stage has been reached they are subject to tithes.","4037":"Unripe grapes: as soon as they contain juice he may eat them with bread in the field. When they have begun to ripen, he may take them home. And similarly in the other years of the sabbatical cycle when they have reached this latter stage they are subject to tithes.","4038":"Olives, as soon as they can produce a quarter log of oil for each se'ah, they may be split and eaten in a field. When they produce a half-log, then he may crush them in a field and use their oil. When they have reached a third of their overall potential, they may be crushed in the field and brought home. And similarly in the other years of the sabbatical cycle when they have reached this latter stage they are subject to tithes. With all other fruit of trees the season when they become due to be tithed is the season when they are permitted in the seventh year.","4039":"From when may they no longer cut down trees in the seventh year? Bet Shammai says: every tree, after it has produced fruit. Bet Hillel says: carob trees after the carobs begin to droop, vines after the berries begin to be moist, olive-trees after they had blossomed, any other tree after it has produced fruit. And any tree as soon as it reaches the season for tithes it may be cut down. How much should be on an olive tree such that it may not be cut down? A quarter kav. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: all depends on the olive-tree.","4040":"White figs: their \u201csheviit\u201d is in the second year of the sabbatical year, since they ripen once in three years. Rabbi Judah says: Persian figs, their \u201csheviit\u201d is in the year following the seventh year, since they ripen once in two years. Thereupon they said to him: this was said only of the species of white figs.","4041":"One who buries luf in the soil during the sabbatical year:Rabbi Meir says: it must be not less than two seahs in quantity, three handbreadths in height, and covered with earth one handbreadth deep. The sages say: it must be not less than four kabs in quantity, one handbreadth high, and covered with earth one handbreadth deep. And he should bury it in a place where people walk.","4042":"Luf which has remained in the ground until after the passing of the seventh year:Rabbi Eliezer says: if the poor had gathered its leaves, then they have gathered. If not, then an account must be made with the poor. Rabbi Joshua says: if the poor had gathered its leaves, then they have gathered. If not, the poor have no account with him (the field owner).","4043":"Luf of the sixth year that has entered the seventh year, similarly summer onions and puah grown in good soil:Bet Shammai says: they must be uprooted with wooden rakes. Bet Hillel says: even with metal rakes. They agree in the case of puah with strong roots, that they may be uprooted with metal spades.","4044":"From when may one buy luf after the seventh year? Rabbi Judah says: immediately. But the sages say: only after the new crop has appeared.","4045":"These are the implements which a craftsman may not sell in the seventh year:A plow and all its accompanying implements, a yoke, a winnowing-fan, and a pickax. But he may sell a sickle used by hand, a scythe, and a cart with all its implements. This is the general principle: any tools designed for work involving a transgression in the seventh year is prohibited; but if for a forbidden and a permissible purpose, it may be sold.","4046":"The potter may sell five oil-jars and fifteen wine-jars, for this is the usual amount one collects from ownerless produce. But if he brought more, it is still permitted. He may also sell more jars to Gentiles in the land of Israel and to Jews outside of the land.","4047":"Bet Shammai says: one must not sell him a plowing cow in the seventh year. But Bet Hillel permits, since he may slaughter it. One may sell him produce even at sowing time. And one may lend him a seah measure, even though he knows that he has a threshing-floor. One may exchange coins for him, even though he knows that he has workers. But all these things, if he expresses that they will be used for unlawful purposes, then they are forbidden.","4048":"A woman may lend to her neighbor who is suspect of transgressing the laws of the sabbatical year, a sifter, a sieve, a hand-mill, or an oven. But she may not sift or grind with her. The wife of a haver may lend to the wife of an am haaretz a sifter and a sieve and may even sift, grind, or sift flour with her. But once she poured water over the flour, she may not touch it with her, for one may not aid those who commit a transgression. And all these things were only allowed in the interests of peace. They may offer encouragement to Gentiles during the sabbatical year, but not to Jews. In the interests of peace, one may also offer greetings to Gentiles.","4049":"The land of Israel is divided into three territories with regard to the sabbatical law.Any produce grown in land that was occupied by those who came up from Babylon, namely from Eretz Israel as far as Chezib, may not be eaten, nor may its soil be cultivated. Any produce grown in land that was occupied by those who came up from Egypt, namely from Chezib to the river, and until Amonah, may be eaten, but its soil may not be cultivated. From the river till Amonah and inwards, produce may be eaten and the soil cultivated.","4050":"In Syria, one may perform work on produce that has been detached, but not on produced attached to the soil. They may thresh, winnow, and tread the grapes, or make the grain into sheaves, but they may not harvest the crops, nor cut the grapes, nor harvest the olives. Rabbi Akiva said this principle: the kind of work that is permitted in Eretz Israel may also be done in Syria.","4051":"Onions on which rain fell and which had sprouted, if their leaves had turned black, they are forbidden; if they had become green they are permitted. Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus says: if they can be plucked out by their leaves, they are forbidden. In the year after the sabbatical year, the like of these are permitted.","4052":"When may one buy vegetables at the outgoing of the sabbatical year without fear that they are sabbatical produce?When enough time has passed for similar vegetables to grow. Where produce ripens quickly, even that which is late in ripening is also permissible. Rabbi used to allow the buying of vegetables immediately after the sabbatical year was over.","4053":"One may not take oil of terumah that had to be burned, nor produce of the seventh year, from the land of Israel to other countries. Rabbi Shimon said: I have heard it expressly stated that they may be exported to Syria, but not to any other country outside the land.","4054":"They may not import terumah from outside the land of Israel into Israel. Rabbi Shimon said: I have heard it expressly stated that they may be bring from Syria, but not from any other country outside the land.","4055":"They said an important general principle with regard to the sabbatical year:  anything that is food for man or beast, or a species of plants used for dyeing, and cannot be left growing in the soil, the law of the sabbatical year is applied both to it and to its money substitute and the law of removal applies both to it and to its money substitute. Which are they?  The leaves of the wild luf, the leaf of ceterach, endives, leeks, portulaca, and netz hahalav. What is the food for cattle?  Thorns and thistles. What is species of dyeing matter?   Aftergrowths of woad and madder. The law of the seventh year applies both to them and to their money-substitutes and the law of removal applies both to them and to their money substitute.","4056":"And they said yet another general principle: Anything that is food for man or beast, or is used for dyeing, but can be left in the soil, the law of the sabbatical year applies both to it and to its money substitute but the law of removal does not apply to it or to its money substitute. Which are these? The root of wild luf, the root of ceterach, scolopendrium, the root of netz hahalav and buchreyah. What is the species of dyeing matter?  Puah and reseda. The law of the sabbatical year applies both to them and to their money substitute but the law of removal does not apply to them or to their money substitute. Rabbi Meir says: their money substitutes must be removed by Rosh Hashanah. They said to him: since this law does not apply to the plants themselves, all the more so it does not apply to their money-substitute.","4057":"The peels and the blossom of the pomegranate, the nutshells, and fruit seeds the laws of sabbatical produce apply to them and to their money substitutes. The dyer may use them for himself, but he may not dye with them for a wage, since one may not engage in business with seventh year produce, or with first-born animals, or with terumah, or with nevelah, or with trefah, or with reptiles or with creeping things. One should not buy field-vegetables and sell them in the market. But he may gather them and have his son sell them on his behalf. If he gathered them for his own use, and some remains over, he may sell them.","4058":"If one buys a first-born animal for his son\u2019s wedding feast, or for a festival, and then decides that he has no need for it, he may sell it. Trappers of wild animals, birds and fishes, who chanced upon unclean species, may sell them. Rabbi Judah says: also a man who happened to chance one upon by accident may buy or sell, provided that he does not make this into his regular profession. But the sages prohibit.","4059":"The lulavim of hawthorn trees and carobs the laws of sheviit apply to them and to their money substitutes, the law of removal applies to them and to their money substitutes. The lulavim of the terebinth, the pistachio tree and the white thorn, the laws of sheviit apply to them and to their money substitutes, but the law of removal does not apply to them and to their money substitutes. But as for the leaves the law of removal applies, since they fall from their stem.","4060":"The rose, henna, balsam, the lotus tree the laws of sheviit apply to them and to their money substitutes. Rabbi Shimon says: sheviit does not apply to the balsam, since it is not a fruit.","4061":"If a new rose has been preserved in old oil, the rose may be taken out. But if an old rose was preserved in new oil, it is subject to the law of removal. New carobs preserved in old wine, or old carobs in new wine, are subject to the law of removal. This is the general principle: Any thing that imparts taste, he must remove it if it is one kind mixed with a different kind. But if it is mixed with the identical kind, then the whole is subject to removal even if only the smallest quantity exists. Sabbatical year produce renders similar kinds prohibited even if it exists in the smallest quantity. But if of different species only when it imparts taste.","4062":"They said an important general principle with regard to the sabbatical year: Anything that is usually designated as food for humans, one may not make a poultice of it for a person. And there is no need to say that he may not make a poultice of it for a beast. Anything that is not usually designated as for food for humans may be used as a poultice for a person, but not for cattle. And anything not usually designated either for humans or for animals, but now he thought to use it as food for either a person or an animal, we impose upon it the stringent laws applying both to people and beasts. If he thought to use it as wood for a fire, behold it is treated as wood and the laws of sheviit do not apply; for example, savory, hyssop, or thyme.","4063":"Sabbatical year produce may be used for food, drink and for anointing. That which is usually eaten can be used for food only; that which is usually used for anointing can be used only for anointing, and that which is usually used for drinking can be used for drink only. One may not anoint with wine and vinegar, but he may anoint with oil. So too with terumah and second tithe. Greater leniency was applied to oil of the seventh year, since it can be used for lamp-kindling.","4064":"Produce of the seventh year may not be sold by measure, weight or number. Neither may figs be sold by number, nor vegetables by weight. Bet Shammai says: they may not be sold, even in bundles. But Bet Hillel says: that which is usually tied in bundles to bring to the house may even be tied into bundles for the market, such as leeks and netz hahalav.","4065":"If one says to a worker: \u201cTake this issar and gather vegetables for me today,\u201d his payment is permitted. But if he said: \u201cIn return for this issar, gather vegetables for me today,\u201d then his payment is forbidden. If one bought a loaf from a baker worth a pondion and said: \u201cWhen I have gathered vegetables from the field, I will bring them to you,\u201d this is permitted. If he bought it from him without any explanation, he may not pay him his debt with the value of seventh year produce, for no debt can be paid with the value of seventh year produce.","4066":"They may not pay sheviit proceeds to a well-digger, an attendant at a public bath, a barber, or a sailor. But he may give them to well-digger so that the well-digger will provide him with drink. To all of them he may give it as a gift.","4067":"Sabbatical figs may not be cut in the muktzeh, but he may cut them in an open place. Grapes may not be trodden in the wine-press, but they may be trodden in a kneading-trough. Olives may not be prepared in an olive-press or in a small olive-press, but he may crush them and bring them into a small olive-press in the field. Rabbi Shimon says: they may even be crushed in the larger olive-press, and then he brings them into the smaller press.","4068":"One may not cook sheviit vegetables in oil of terumah lest they become invalidated. But Rabbi Shimon permits it. The last thing exchanged is always subject to the sabbatical law, and the produce itself   remains forbidden.","4069":"One might not buy slaves, land, or an unclean beast with sheviit money. If he did buy he must buy and eat food for their equivalent. One may not bring the bird-offerings of a zav or a zavah, or of a woman after childbirth with sheviit money. If he did bring he must buy and eat food for their equivalent. One may not anoint vessels with oil of seventh year produce. If he did annoint he must buy and eat food for their equivalent.","4070":"A hide which they oiled with seventh year oil: Rabbi Eliezer says: it must be burnt; But the sages say: he must buy and eat food for its equivalent. They said in front of Rabbi Akiba: Rabbi Eliezer used to say, A hide which they smeared with seventh year oil must be burnt. He replied: Silence! I won\u2019t tell you what Rabbi Eliezer actually said in this connection.","4071":"They also said in front of him: Rabbi Eliezer use to say: \u201cWhoever eats bread baked by Samaritans is like one who eats the flesh of a pig.\u201d He replied: Silence! I won\u2019t tell you what Rabbi Eliezer actually said in this connection.","4072":"A bathhouse that is heated with straw or stubble grown during the Sabbatical year, one is allowed to bath in it. But if he is an important person whose actions will be influential, he may not bathe in it.","4073":"Rue, goosefoot, purslane, hill coriander, celery, and meadow-berries, are exempt from tithes. And they may be purchased from anyone during the sabbatical year, since such produce is not usually stored. Rabbi Judah says: aftergrowths of mustard are permitted, since transgressors are not suspected concerning them. Rabbi Shimon says: all aftergrowths are permitted, with the exception of the aftergrowths of cabbage, since such cannot be placed within the category of field-vegetables. But the sages say: all aftergrowths are forbidden.","4074":"There are three territories in respect to the law of removal of sheviit produce:   these are: Judea, Transjordan, and Galilee, and there are three territories in each one. Upper Galilee, lower Galilee, and the valley. From Kefar Hananiah upwards, the region where sycamores do not grow, is Upper Galilee. From Kefar Hananiah downwards, where the sycamores do grow, is Lower Galilee. The borders of Tiberias are the valley. Those of Judea are: the mountain region, the plains of the south, and the valley. The plains of Lod are like the plains of the south, and its mountain region is like the king's hill-country. From Bet Horon to the sea is considered as one land.","4075":"Why did they speak of three territories? So that they may eat in each country until the last of the seventh year produce in that country is ended. Rabbi Shimon says: they have spoken of three countries only in the case of Judea, but all other territories are to be regarded as King\u2019s mountain (Har Hamelekh). And all other territories are the same with regard to the olive and date.","4076":"One may eat by virtue of similar produce regarded as ownerless still found in the fields, but not when it was stored and declared ownerless. Rabbi Yose permits even when it was stored and then declared ownerless. One may continue to eat by virtue of the poor grains that grow between the grass, or by virtue of the trees that yield bi-annually, but one must not eat by virtue of winter-grapes. Rabbi Judah permits provided they began to ripen before the summer of the seventh year had ended.","4077":"One who preserved three kinds of vegetables in one jar: Rabbi Eliezer says they may be eaten only so long as the first still remains in the field. But Rabbi Joshua says: even so long as the last remains. Rabban Gamaliel says: when the like kind is no longer to be found in the field, the same kind in the jar must be removed, and the halachah agrees with him. Rabbi Shimon says: all vegetables are regarded as one kind in respect of the law of removal. Purslane may be eaten until there is no more wild purslane in the valley of Bet Netopha.","4078":"If one gathered moist herbs, he may eat them until the sweet herbs in the field have dried up. And if he gathered dry herbs, he may eat them until the second rainfall. Leaves of reeds and of leaves of the vine may be eaten until they fall from the stems. But if he gathered them dry, they may be eaten until the second rainfall. Rabbi Akiba says: in all these cases, they may be eaten until the second rainfall.","4079":"Similarly, if one rents a house to someone \u201cuntil the rains,\u201d he means until the second rainfall. Or if one had vowed not to derive any benefit from his friend \u201cuntil the rains\u201d he is prohibited until the second rainfall. Until when may the poor enter the orchards?  Until the second rainfall. And when may one begin to enjoy or burn the straw and stubble of sabbatical produce?   After the second rainfall.","4080":"If one had sabbatical produce at home and the time of removal had come, he may give out food for three meals to every one. Rabbi Judah says: the poor may eat from it even after the removal, but not the rich. But Rabbi Yose says: both the poor and the rich may eat after the removal.","4081":"If one had inherited seventh year produce or had received them as a gift: Rabbi Eliezer says: they must be given to anyone who eats them. But the sages say: the sinner must not benefit, rather it should be sold to anyone who eats it, and its price divided among everyone. If one eats dough of seventh year produce before the hallah was taken from it, he has incurred thereby the death penalty at the hands of heaven.","4082":"The sabbatical year cancels a debt written in a document or one not written in a document. A debt to a shop is not cancelled, but if it had been converted into the form of a loan, then it is cancelled. Rabbi Judah says: the former debt is always cancelled. A wage-debt to a worker is not cancelled, but if it had been converted into a loan it is cancelled. Rabbi Yose says: the payment for any work that must cease with the seventh year, is cancelled, but if it need not cease with the seventh year, then it is not cancelled.","4083":"One who slaughters a cow and divides it up on Rosh Hashanah at the end of the seventh year: If the month had been intercalated, the debt is remitted. But if it had not been intercalated, it is not remitted. Fines for rape, for seduction, for defamation, and all other obligations arising from legal procedure, are not remitted. One who loans and takes a pledge, and one who hands over his debt documents to a court, these debts are not remitted.","4084":"A loan secured by a prozbul  is not cancelled. This was one of the things enacted by Hillel the elder; for when he observed people refraining from lending to one another, and thus transgressing what is written in the Torah, \u201cBeware, lest you harbor the base thought, \u2018The seventh year, the year of remission, is approaching,\u2019 so that you are mean to your needy kinsman and give him nothing.\u201d Hillel enacted the prozbul.","4085":"This is the formula of the prozbul: \u201cI turn over to you, so-and-so, judges of such and such a place, that any debt that I may have outstanding, I shall collect it whenever I desire.\u201d And the judges sign below, or the witnesses.","4086":"A pre-dated prozbul is valid, but a post-dated one, is invalid. Pre-dated loan documents of loans are invalid, but post-dated one valid. If one borrows from five persons, then he writes a separate prozbul for each creditor. But if five borrow from the same person, then he writes only one prozbul for them all.","4087":"A prozbul is written only for a debt secured by land. But if the debtor has none, then the creditor can give him title to a share, however small, of his own field. If he had land in pledge in a city, a prozbul can be written on it. Rabbi Hutzpit says: a prozbul may be written for a man on the security of his wife's property, or for an orphan on the security of property belonging to his guardian.","4088":"A bee-hive:Rabbi Eliezer says: Behold, it is like land and a prozbul may be written using it as security and it is not susceptible to uncleanness while it remains in its place, and one who takes honey from it on Shabbat is liable. But the sages say: it is not like land, a prozbul may not be written using it as security, it is susceptible to uncleanness while in its place, and one who takes honey from it on Shabbat is exempt.","4089":"One who returns a debt after the seventh year, the creditor must say to the debtor: \u201cI remit it.\u201d But the debtor should say: \u201cEven so I will repay it.\u201d The creditor may then accept it from him, because it says: \u201cAnd this is the word of the release\u201d (Deuteronomy 15:2). Similarly, when an accidental killer has been exiled to a city of refuge, and the citizens want to honor him, he must say to them: \u201cI am a murderer.\u201d If they say: \u201cEven so, we want to honor you, then he may accept the honor from them, because it says: \u201cAnd this is the word of the murderer\u201d (Deuteronomy 19:4).","4090":"One who repays his debts after the seventh year, the sages are pleased with him. One who borrows from a convert whose sons had converted with him, the debt need not be repaid to his sons, but if he returns it the sages are pleased with him. All movable property can be acquired only by the act of drawing, but whoever fulfills his word, the sages are well pleased with him.","4091":"Five may not give terumah, and if they do so, their terumah is not considered terumah:A heresh (deaf-mute); an imbecile, a minor, And the one who gives terumah from that which is not his own. If a non-Jew gave terumah from that which belongs to an Israelite, even if it was with his permission, his terumah is not terumah.","4092":"A \u201cheresh\u201d, who speaks but cannot hear, may not give terumah, but if he does so, his terumah is terumah. The \u201cheresh\u201d of whom the sages generally speak is one who neither hears nor speaks.","4093":"A minor who has not yet produced two pubic hairs: Rabbi Judah says: his terumah is terumah. Rabbi Yose says: if he has not arrived at the age when his vows are valid, his terumah is not terumah, but if he has arrived at an age where his vows are valid, his terumah is terumah.","4094":"They should not take terumah from olives for oil, or from grapes for wine. If one did: Bet Shammai says: there is terumah in the olives or grapes themselves. But Bet Hillel says: the terumah is not terumah.","4095":"They do not take terumah from \u2018gleanings\u2019, from \u2018the forgotten sheaf\u2019, from peah or from ownerless produce. Neither is it taken from first tithe from which terumah had already been taken, nor from second tithe and dedicated produce that had been redeemed. Nor is it taken from that which is subject to terumah for that which is exempt from terumah, nor from that which is exempt for that which is subject. Nor from produce already plucked from the soil for that attached to it, nor from that attached to the soil for that already plucked. Nor from new produce for old, nor from old for new. Nor from produce from the land of Israel for produce grown outside the land, nor from that grown out of the land for that grown in the land. In all these cases if they did take terumah, their terumah is not terumah.","4096":"Five may not give terumah, but if they do, their terumah is terumah.A mute person; A drunken person; One who is naked; A blind person; Or one who has had a seminal emission. They may not give terumah, but if they do their terumah is valid.","4097":"They may not give terumah according to measure, or weight, or number, but one may give it from that which has already been measured, weighed or counted. They may not give terumah in a basket or a hamper of a measured capacity, but one may give in it when it is a half or a third filled. He may not give a half of seah in a seah measuring vessel, for this half constitutes a known measure.","4098":"They may not give terumah from oil for crushed olives nor may they give terumah from wine for trodden grapes. If he did so, his terumah is terumah, but he must give terumah again. The first terumah renders on its own produce into which it falls \u201cdoubtful terumah\u201d and is subject to the added fifth, but not the second.","4099":"They may give terumah from oil for pickled olives, or from wine for grapes made into raisins. Behold, he gave terumah from oil for olives intended for eating, or from other olives for olives intended for eating, or for wine for grapes intended for eating, of from other grapes for grapes intended for eating, and he decided afterwards to press them, he need not give terumah again.","4100":"They may not take terumah from produce whose processing has been completed for produce whose processing has not been completed, or from produce whose processing has not been completed for produce whose processing has been completed or from produce whose processing has not been completed for other produce whose processing has not been completed. If they did take terumah, their terumah is terumah.","4101":"They may not give terumah from pure produce for impure produce, but if they did give, the terumah is terumah. In truth they said:  If a cake of pressed figs had become partly defiled, one may give terumah from the clean part for that part which had become defiled. The same applies to a bunch of vegetables, or a stack of grain. If there were two cakes of figs, two bunches of vegetables, two stacks of grain, one pure and one impure, one should not give terumah from one for the other. Rabbi Eliezer says: one can give terumah from that which is pure for that which is impure.","4102":"They may not give terumah from impure produce for that which is pure. If he did give: If unwittingly, the terumah is valid; If intentionally he has done nothing. So too, if a Levite had unclean tithe from which terumah had not been given, and he gave terumah from this, if unwittingly, the terumah is valid, if intentionally he has done nothing. Rabbi Judah says: if he knew of it at the outset, even if done in error, he has done nothing.","4103":"One who immerses unclean vessels on Shabbat: If unwittingly, he may use them. But if intentionally, he may not use them. One who separates tithes, or cooks on Shabbat: If unwittingly, he may eat it. But if intentionally, he may not eat it. One who plants on Shabbat: If unwittingly, he may keep the tree. But if intentionally, he must uproot it. But if during the sabbatical year, whether it was planted unwittingly or intentionally he must uproot it.","4104":"They may not give terumah from one kind for another kind, and if he did give, the terumah is not terumah. All kinds of wheat count as one. All kinds of fresh figs, dried figs and fig cakes count as one, and he may take terumah from one for the other. Wherever there is a priest, one must give terumah from the very best, and where there is no priest, one must give terumah from that which lasts longest. Rabbi Judah says: he should always give only from the very best.","4105":"They should give terumah of a whole small onion, and not of half of a large onion. Rabbi Judah says: not so, rather half of a large onion. So too, Rabbi Judah says: they give terumah from town onions for those from the village, but not from village onions for those from the town, since these are the food of its principal citizens.","4106":"They may give terumah from olives to be used for oil for those to be preserved, but not from olives due to be preserved for olives to be used for oil. They may give from unboiled wine for boiled wine, but not from boiled wine for unboiled wine. This is the general rule: any two things which together are kilayim he should not give terumah from one for the other, even if one is superior and the other inferior. But if they are not kilayim, then one may give terumah from the superior for that which is inferior, but not from the inferior for that which is superior. If one does give terumah from the inferior for that which is superior, his terumah is terumah, except for zunin given for wheat, since these are not food. Cucumbers and melon count are one kind. Rabbi Judah says: two kinds.","4107":"If one gave a cucumber as terumah and it was found to be bitter, a melon and it was found to be rotten, it is considered terumah, but he must again give terumah. If one gave a jar of wine as terumah and it was found to be vinegar: If prior to his act he knew that it was vinegar, the terumah is not valid; But if it had turned sour after he had given it as terumah, behold it is terumah. In case of doubt, it is terumah but he must again give terumah. The first terumah does not render on its own produce into which it falls \u201cdoubtful terumah\u201d and it is not subject to the added fifth, and so the second.","4108":"If one of them falls into non-sacred produce, it does not make the mixture medumma a mixture into which terumah has fallen. If the second of them falls then into another place, it also does not make it medumma. But if both fall into one place, they do make it medumma, according to the size of the smaller of the two.","4109":"Two partners who took terumah, the one after the other:Rabbi Akiva says: the terumah of them both is terumah. But the sages say: the terumah of the first is terumah. Rabbi Yose says: if the first gave the prescribed amount, the terumah of the second is not terumah, but if the first did not give the prescribed amount, the terumah of the second is terumah.","4110":"To what does this apply? Only if one did not confer with the other, but if one allows a member of his household, or his slave or female slave to give terumah for him, this terumah is terumah. If he annulled this permission: If he annulled it before the taking of the terumah, the terumah is not terumah; But if he annulled it after the terumah had been taken, the terumah is terumah. Workers have no permission to give terumah, except for those who tread grapes for they defile the winepress immediately.","4111":"If one says: \u201cThe terumah of this pile is within it,\u201d or, \u201cits tithes are within it,\u201d or, \u201cthe terumah of tithe terumat maaser is within it:\u201d Rabbi Shimon says: he has thereby designated it. But the sages say: not unless he said, \u201cIt is in the north or south of it.\u201d Rabbi Elazar Hisma says: one who says, \u201cThe terumah of this pile is taken from it for it,\u201d he has thereby designated it. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: one who says, \u201cThe tenth part of this tithe is terumah of tithe for that pile,\u201d he has thereby designated it.","4112":"He who gives terumah before first-fruits, or first tithe before terumah, or second tithe before first tithe, although he transgresses a negative commandment, that which he has done is done, for it is said: \u201cYou shall not delaying the skimming of the first yield of your vats\u201d (Exodus 22:28).","4113":"From where do we derive that first-fruits must precede terumah, seeing that this one is called \u201cterumah\u201d and \u201cthe first\u201d and the other is also called \u201cterumah\u201d and \u201cthe first\u201d? Rather first-fruits take precedence since they are the first fruits of all produce. And terumah comes before the first tithe also because it is called \u201cfirst.\u201d And first tithe precedes second tithe, because it includes that which is called \u201cfirst.\u201d","4114":"He who intends saying \u2018terumah\u2019 and says \u2018tithe\u2019, or \u2018tithe\u2019 and says \u2018terumah\u2019; \u2018Burnt-offering\u2019 and he says \u2018peace-offering\u2019, or \u2018peace-offering\u2019 and he says \u2018burnt-offering\u2019; \u2018I vow that I will not enter this house,\u2019 and says \u2018that house\u2019, \u2018That I will not derive any benefit from this man,\u2019 and says \u2018from that man,\u2019 he has said nothing until his heart and mind are at one.","4115":"Terumah given by a non-Jew or a Samaritan is terumah and their tithes are tithes and their dedications to the Temple are dedications. Rabbi Judah says: the law of the vineyard in the fourth year is not applicable to a non-Jew. But the sages say: it is. The terumah of a non-Jew renders produce into which it falls medumma and one who eats it unwittingly is obligated to pay back an extra fifth. But Rabbi Shimon exempts it.","4116":"One who sets aside only part of terumah and tithes, may take terumah from that heap, but he may not take terumah from it for other produce. Rabbi Meir says: he can also take terumah and tithes for produce elsewhere.","4117":"If one had his produce in a storehouse, and he gave a seah to a Levite and a seah to a poor person, he may set aside another eight seahs and eat them, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: he may only set aside according to proportion.","4118":"The amount of terumah: A generous amount: one fortieth. Beth Shammai say: one thirtieth. The average amount: one fiftieth. A stingy amount: one sixtieth. If he gave terumah and discovered that it was only one sixtieth, his terumah is valid and he need not give again. If he does go back and add to it, the extra amount is liable to tithes. If he found that it was only one sixty-first it is valid, but he must give terumah again according to his established practice, in measure, weight or number. Rabbi Judah says: even if it be not from produce close by.","4119":"One who says to his messenger: \u201cGo and give terumah for me,\u201d he should give terumah in accordance with the mind of the owner. If he does not know the mind of the owner, he gives according to the average amount  one fiftieth. If he gave ten parts less or more, the terumah is terumah. If, however, his intention was to add even one part more, his terumah is not terumah.","4120":"One who wishes to give more terumah:Rabbi Eliezer says: he may give up to a tenth part, as in the case of heave-offering of tithe.   If he gave more than this measure he must make it terumah of tithe for other produce. Rabbi Ishmael says: half non-sacred produce and half terumah. Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiba say: as long as he retains a part as non-sacred produce.","4121":"On three occasions they measure the contents of the basket: At the full time of the first ripe fruits, and of the late summer fruits, and in the middle of the summer. He who counts the fruit is praiseworthy, he who measures it is more praiseworthy, and he who weighs them is most praiseworthy of all.","4122":"Rabbi Eliezer says: terumah can be taken out if it falls into a hundred and one parts. Rabbi Joshua says: in a hundred and more, and this \u201cmore\u201d has no definite measure. Rabbi Yose ben Meshullam says: this \u2018more\u2019 must be a kav to a hundred seahs, a sixth of the seah which renders the whole as medumma.","4123":"Rabbi Joshua says: black figs can bring up white ones, and white ones can bring up black ones. In the case of cakes of figs, the large can bring up the small, and the small can bring up the large. Round cakes of figs can bring up square cakes, and square cakes can bring up round ones. Rabbi Eliezer prohibits this. Rabbi Akiba says: if the kind which fell in is known, then the one kind cannot bring up the other kind, but if the kind is not known, the one kind can bring up the other.","4124":"How so?  If there were fifty black figs and fifty white fig, and a black fig fell in, the black figs are forbidden, but the white figs are permitted; and if a white fig fell in them, the white figs are forbidden and the black figs are permitted. If it is unknown which kind fell in, then each kind helps to bring up the other. In this case, Rabbi Eliezer is stringent and Rabbi Joshua is lenient.","4125":"But in this, Rabbi Eliezer is more lenient and Rabbi Joshua more stringent. One was pressing a litra of dried figs of terumah into a jar and he didn\u2019t know which: Rabbi Eliezer says: they are to be regarded as if they were separated, so that those below can bring up those above. Rabbi Joshua says: it cannot be brought up unless there are a hundred jars.","4126":"A seah of terumah which fell on top of a pile and he skimmed it off: Rabbi Eliezer says: if in that which he skimmed off there are hundred seahs, it can be taken out through a ratio of one hundred to one. But Rabbi Joshua says: it cannot be brought up. A seah of terumah which fell on top of a pile, he must skim it off. If so, why did they say that terumah can be taken up in one hundred and one parts? Only if it is not known whether it has become mixed up or where it has fallen.","4127":"Two baskets or two piles and a seah of terumah fell on top of one of them and it is not known into which it had fallen, they bring up the terumah in the other. Rabbi Shimon says: even if they are in two cities, they bring up the terumah in the other.","4128":"Rabbi Yose said: A case once came before Rabbi Akiva concerning fifty bundles of vegetables into which a bundle of the same size had fallen, half of which was terumah. And I said in front of him, that it can be brought up, not because terumah can be brought up in fifty-one, but because there were one hundred and two halves there.","4129":"If a seah of unclean terumah fell into less than a hundred seahs of hullin, or first tithe, or second tithe, or dedicated property, whether these were unclean or clean, they must all be left to rot. If the seah of terumah was clean, the mixture must be sold to priests at the price of terumah, excluding the value of that seah itself. If it fell into first tithe, he should declare terumah of tithe. And if it fell into second tithe or dedicated property, they must be redeemed. If the hullin was unclean, it may be eaten in small quantities, or roasted, or kneaded with fruit juice, or divided into pieces of dough so that the size of one egg be not in any one place.","4130":"A seah of unclean terumah which fell into a hundred of clean hullin:Rabbi Eliezer says: a seah must be taken out and burnt, for I say that the seah taken out is the one that fell in. But the sages say: it may be taken out and eaten in small quantities, or roasted, or kneaded with fruit juice, or divided into pieces of dough so that the size of one egg be not in any one place.","4131":"A seah of clean terumah fell into a hundred of unclean hullin, it may be eaten in small quantities, or roasted, or kneaded with fruit juice, or divided into pieces of dough so that the size of one egg be not in any one place.","4132":"A seah of unclean terumah that falls into one hundred seahs of clean terumah: Bet Shammai prohibits, But Bet Hillel permits. Bet Hillel said to Bet Shammai: since clean terumah is forbidden to non-priests and unclean terumah is forbidden to priests, then just as clean terumah is brought up, so too unclean terumah can be brought up. Bet Shammai answered them: No! If hullin which is treated more leniently in that it is permitted to non-priests allows us to bring up clean terumah that falls into it, does terumah which is more stringent in that it is forbidden to non-priests also allow us to bring up that which is unclean? After Bet Shammai had agreed with Bet Hillel, Rabbi Eliezer said: it should be taken out and burned. But the sages say: it is gone, on account of its being a tiny portion of the whole mixture.","4133":"A seah of terumah that fell into a hundred of hullin, and he lifted it out and fell into hullin elsewhere:Rabbi Eliezer says: it renders medumma as though it were certainly terumah. But the sages say: it is rendered medumma only according to proportion.","4134":"A seah of terumah which fell into less than a hundred of hullin, and rendered the whole medumma, and part of this mixture fell afterwards into another place: Rabbi Eliezer says: it renders again medumma as if certain terumah had fallen in. But the sages say: the first mixture renders medumma only according to the proportion. Similarly, that which is leavened with terumah renders other dough leavened as with terumah only according to the proportion. And drawn water disqualifies a ritual bath also only according to the proportion.","4135":"If a seah of terumah fell into a hundred of hullin and he lifted a seah out, and then another fell in, and he lifted another out and another fell in, the pile is permissible as long as the amount of terumah does not exceed that of the hullin.","4136":"If a seah of terumah fell into a hundred of hullin, and before he could take it out, another fell in, the whole becomes forbidden. Rabbi Shimon permits it.","4137":"If a seah of terumah fell into a hundred of hullin, and they were ground together and reduced in bulk, just as the hullin was reduced so too the terumah was reduced, and it is permitted. If a seah of terumah fell into less than a hundred of hullin and they were ground together and increased in bulk, just as the hullin became more, so too the terumah became more, and it is forbidden. If it is known that the kernels of hullin were better than the terumah, it is permitted. If a seah of terumah fell into less than a hundred of hullin, and more hullin fell in afterwards, if it was accidental it is permissible, but if intentional it is forbidden.","4138":"One who eats terumah unwittingly must repay its value plus a fifth, whether he eats it or drinks it, or anoints himself with it, or whether the terumah is clean or unclean. If he eats the added fifth he must pay its fifth, and a fifth of that fifth. He may not repay with terumah, but rather with tithed hullin, which becomes terumah. And whatever may be repaid in its place also becomes terumah and if the priest wishes to forego the fine, he cannot do so.","4139":"A daughter of an Israelite ate terumah and afterwards married a priest:If the terumah she ate had not yet been acquired by another priest she can repay to herself the value and the fifth. But if a priest had already acquired the terumah she had eaten, she must repay the value to the owners, but she can repay the fifth to herself, because they said that he who eats terumah unwittingly, pays the value to the owners and the fifth to whoever he wants.","4140":"If one gives his workmen or his guests terumah to eat he must repay the principal and they must pay the fifth, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: they must pay both the value and the fifth, and he must pay them for the price of their meal.","4141":"If one stole terumah but did not eat it, he must return double-payment at the price of terumah. If he ate it, he must pay twice the value plus a fifth, one principal value and a fifth at the price of hullin, and the other principal at the price of terumah. If one stole terumah of dedicated property and ate it, he must repay two fifths and the principal value, for the laws of double-payment do not apply to dedicated property.","4142":"They may not make repayment from gleanings, from forgotten sheaf, from peah or ownerless property. Nor from first tithe from which terumah has been taken, nor from second tithe or dedicated produce which have been redeemed, because one dedicated thing cannot be used to redeem another dedicated thing (kadosh), the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages permit payment with these.","4143":"Rabbi Eliezer says: they may make repayment from one kind for another, provided that it is from a superior kind for an inferior kind. Rabbi Akiva says: they may make repayment only from the same kind. Hence if a man ate cucumbers grown a year before the seventh year, he must wait for those grown after the termination of the seventh year and repay with them. The same source which causes Rabbi Eliezer to be lenient causes Rabbi Akiva to be stringent, for it says: \u201cAnd he shall give the priest the holy thing (hakadesh)\u201d (Leviticus 22:14), implying, whatever is liable to become \u201ckodesh,\u201d the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But Rabbi Akiva says: \u201cAnd he shall give the priest the holy thing (kodesh),\u201d implying the same kind of holy thing which he ate.","4144":"One who eats terumah intentionally must repay its value, but not the fifth. And the repayment remains hullin, therefore, if the priest wishes to forgive the repayment, he may.","4145":"If the daughter of a priest married an Israelite and afterwards ate terumah, she must repay the value but not the fifth, and her death-penalty for adultery is by burning. If she married any of those disqualified from marrying her, she must pay back both the value and the fifth, and her death-penalty for adultery is by strangling, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: in either case, she repays the value but not the fifth, and the death penalty is by burning.","4146":"One who feeds terumah to his small children, or to his slaves whether they are of majority age or minors, or one who eats terumah from outside the land, or less than an olive\u2019s bulk of terumah, must repay the value, but not the fifth; and the repayment remains hullin. Therefore, if the priest wishes to forgive the repayment, he may.","4147":"This is the general principle: whenever one has to repay both the value and the fifth, the repayment becomes terumah, and if the priest desires to forgive the repayment, he cannot forgive. But whenever one has to repay the value only and not the fifth, the repayment remains hullin (non-sacred produce), and if the priest wishes to forgive the repayment, he can.","4148":"If there were two baskets, one of terumah and one of hullin, and a seah of terumah fell into one of them, but it is not known into which, behold I can assume that it had fallen into that of the terumah. Two baskets and it is not known which was of terumah and which of hullin, and he eats from one of them, he is exempt, and the second basket is treated as terumah and subject to the laws of hallah, the words of Rabbi Meir. But Rabbi Yose exempts it. If another person eats from the second basket he is exempt. If one man ate of both, he must repay the value of the smaller of the two.","4149":"If one of these baskets fell into hullin, it does not render it medumma (doubtful terumah), but the second is treated as terumah and subject to the law of hallah, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose exempts it. If the second falls elsewhere into hullin it does not render it medumma. If both of them fall into one place, they render it medumma according to the proportion of the smaller of the two.","4150":"If he used one of these baskets as seed, he is exempt, and the second is treated as if it were terumah and subject to the law of hallah, the words of Rabbi Meir. But Rabbi Yose exempts it. If another person uses the second as seed, then he is exempt. If one man uses both as seed, if it is of a kind whose seed disintegrates in the ground it is permissible, but if it is of the kind whose seed does not disintegrate it is prohibited.","4151":"If a woman was eating terumah, and they came and said to her, \u201cYour husband is dead\u201d, or \u201cHe divorced you.\u201d Or, if a slave was eating terumah, and they came and said to him: \u201cYour master is dead\u201d, or \u201cHe sold you to an Israelite\u201d, or \u201cHe gave you away as a gift\u201d, or \u201cHe emancipated you.\u201d So too, if a priest was eating terumah and it became known that he was the son of a divorced woman or a halutzah (a woman released from levirate marriage): Rabbi Eliezer says: they must repay both the value and the fifth. But Rabbi Joshua exempts them from the added fifth. If a priest was standing and sacrificing on the altar and it became known that he was the son of a divorced woman or a halutzah: Rabbi Eliezer says: all the sacrifices he had offered on the altar are disqualified. But Rabbi Joshua pronounces them valid. If it, however, it became known that he possessed a blemish, his service is disqualified.","4152":"In all the above cases, if terumah was still in their mouth: Rabbi Eliezer says: they may swallow it. But Rabbi Joshua says: they must spit it out. If it was said to him, \u201cYour have become unclean\u201d, or \u201cthe terumah has become unclean\u201d, Rabbi Eliezer says: he may swallow it. But Rabbi Joshua says: he must spit it out. If it was said to him, \u201cYou were unclean\u201d or \u201cthe terumah was unclean\u201d, or it became known that the food he was eating was untithed, or that it was first tithe from which terumah had not yet been taken, or second tithe or dedicated produce that had not been redeemed, or if he tasted the taste of a bug in his mouth, he must spit it out.","4153":"If he was eating a bunch of grapes, and he entered from the garden into the courtyard: Rabbi Eliezer says: he may finish eating. But Rabbi Joshua says: he may not finish. If dusk set in at the eve of Shabbat: Rabbi Eliezer says: he may finish eating. But Rabbi Joshua says: he may not finish.","4154":"If wine of terumah was left uncovered, it must be poured out, and there is no need to say this in the case of hullin. Three kinds of liquids are forbidden if they were left uncovered: water, wine and milk, but all other drinks are permitted. How long do they remain uncovered for them to become prohibited? The time it takes the snake to creep out from a place near by and drink.","4155":"The amount of water that is uncovered:  enough to negate the poison. Rabbi Yose says: in vessels it is forbidden whatever the quantity, but for water on the ground, it must be forty se'ahs.","4156":"Figs, grapes, cucumbers, pumpkins, melons or watermelons that have bite marks, even if they are in a jar, both large or small, both plucked or still attached to the soil, they are forbidden as long as there is juice in them. An animal bitten by a snake is forbidden on account of the danger to life.","4157":"A wine-filter used as a cover does not prevent the wine from becoming forbidden by being uncovered. But Rabbi Nehemiah permits it.","4158":"A jar of terumah which may have become impure:Rabbi Eliezer says: if it had been deposited in an exposed place, he must now place it in a hidden place; and if it had formerly been uncovered, it must now be covered. But Rabbi Joshua says: if it had been in a hidden place, he must now place it in an exposed place; and if it had formerly been covered up, he must now uncover it. Rabban Gamaliel says: let him not do anything new to it.","4159":"A jar of terumah was broken in the upper part of the wine-press, and the lower part was unclean: Both Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua agree that if one can save at least a reviit of it in cleanness he should save it. But if not: Rabbi Eliezer says: let it flow down and become unclean of its own accord, and let him not make it unclean with his own hands.","4160":"Similarly a jar of terumah oil which spilled: Both Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua agree that if he can save at least a reviit in purity he should save it; But if not: Rabbi Eliezer says: let it flow down and be swallowed up by the ground, and let him not make it unclean with his own hands.","4161":"Concerning both cases Rabbi Joshua said: This is not the kind of terumah over which I am cautioned lest I defile it, but rather to eat of it and not to defile it. If one was passing from place to place with loaves of terumah in his hand and a Gentile said to him: \u201cGive me one of these and I will make it unclean; for if not, I will defile them all,\u201d let him defile them all, and not give him deliberately one to defile, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But Rabbi Joshua says: he should place one of them on a rock.","4162":"Similarly, if gentiles say to women, \u201cGive us one of you that we may defile her, and if not, we will defile you all\u201d, then let them all be defiled rather than hand over to them one soul from Israel.","4163":"He who plants terumah, if unwittingly, may overturn it, but if intentionally, he must allow it to remain. If it had already grown a third of its full size, whether he had planted it unwittingly or intentionally, he must allow it to remain. But in the case of flax, even when planted intentionally he must overturn it.","4164":"And it is subject to gleanings, the forgotten sheaf and peah. Poor Israelites and poor priests may glean them, but the poor Israelites must sell theirs to priests for the price of terumah and the money becomes theirs. Rabbi Tarfon says: only poor priests may glean them, lest the others forget and put it into their mouths. Rabbi Akiva said to him: if that be so, then only those who are clean should be allowed to glean.","4165":"And it is also subject to tithes and poor man\u2019s tithe. Both Israelites and priests that are poor may accept them, but the poor Israelites must sell that which is theirs to the priest for the price of terumah and the money belongs to them. He who beats the grain with sticks instead of threashing with an animal is to be praised. But he who threshes it by having an animal walk on it what should he do? He must suspend baskets from the neck of the animal and place in them from the same kind, with the result that he will neither muzzle the animal nor feed it terumah.","4166":"What grows from terumah is terumah, but that which grows from growths of terumah is hullin. As for untithed produce, first tithe, after-growths from the sabbatical year, terumah grown outside the land, mixtures of hullin with terumah and first-fruits what grows from them is hullin. What grows from dedicated produce and second tithe is hullin and it is to be redeemed at its value at the time when it was sown.","4167":"If a hundred rows were planted with terumah seeds and one with hullin, they all are permitted, if they are of a kind whose seed disintegrates in the soil. But if they are of a kind whose seed does not disintegrate in the soil, then even if there be a hundred rows of hullin and one of terumah, they all are prohibited.","4168":"As for untithed produce, what grows from it is permissible if of a kind whose seed disintegrates in the soil. But if of a kind whose seed does not disintegrate, then even what grows from plants which grew out of it are forbidden. Which is the kind whose seed does not disintegrate?   Like luf, garlic and onions. Rabbi Judah says: garlic is like barley.","4169":"He who weeds allium plants for a Gentile, even though the produce is untithed he eat from them in a casual fashion. Saplings of terumah which had become unclean and were re-planted, become clean from their uncleanness. But they must not be eaten until the edible part of the stalk has been lopped off. Rabbi Judah says: he must before eating lop off a second time that which grew on the edible part.","4170":"An onion of terumah was placed into lentils:If the onion was whole, it is permissible; But if the onion had been cut up, it is forbidden if it imparts a flavor. In the case of other dishes, whether the onion is whole or cut up it is forbidden if it imparts a flavor. Rabbi Judah permits it in the case of mashed fish, because it is used only to remove the unpleasant flavor.","4171":"If an apple of terumah was chopped and placed into dough of hullin so that it leavened it, the dough is forbidden. If barley of terumah fell into a cistern of water, though the barley stinks up the water, the water is permissible.","4172":"One who removes warm bread from an oven and places it over an open barrel of terumah wine:Rabbi Meir says: it is forbidden. Rabbi Judah permits it. Rabbi Yose permits the bread of wheat but not of barley, because barley absorbs.","4173":"If an oven was heated with cumin of terumah and bread was baked in it, the bread is permitted, for there is no taste of cumin, just the smell of cumin.","4174":"Fenugreek which fell into a vat of wine:If it was terumah or second tithe and there is in the seed alone without the stalk sufficient to impart a flavor it is forbidden. But if it was seventh year produce or mixed seeds in vineyards, or dedicated produce, it is forbidden if in both seed and stalk there is sufficient to impart a flavor.","4175":"If one had bunches of fenugreek of mixed seeds of the vineyard, they must be burned. If he had bunches of fenugreek of untithed produce, he must beat them and calculate the amount of seed within them and set aside terumah from the seed, but he need not separate terumah from the stalks. But if he did set aside the terumah from the stalks before he beat the bunches he must not say: \u201cI will beat out the seed and take the stalks and give only the seed\u201d but he must give the stalks together with the seed.","4176":"Olives of hullin which were pickled together with olives of terumah, whether it was a case where crushed olives of hullin which were pickled together with crushed olives of terumah, or crushed olives of hullin with whole olives of terumah, or with juice of terumah, they are forbidden. But if whole olives of hullin were pickled with crushed olives of terumah, they are permitted.","4177":"Unclean fish which was pickled with clean fish:If the jug contains two seahs and the unclean fish weighs ten zuz in Judean measure, which is five selas in Galilean measure, the brine is forbidden. Rabbi Judah says: it needs be a quarter of a log in two seahs. Rabbi Yose says: one-sixteenth of it.","4178":"If unclean locusts were pickled together with clean ones, they do not make the brine forbidden. Rabbi Zadok testified that the brine of unclean locusts is clean.","4179":"Vegetables pickled together are permitted, except when pickled with allium (onions, garlic, leeks). Allim of hullin pickled with allium of terumah, or other vegetables of hullin with leeks of terumah are forbidden. But allium of hullin with vegetables of terumah are permitted.","4180":"Rabbi Yose says: Anything stewed with terumah beets becomes forbidden, because they impart a flavor. Rabbi Shimon says: cabbage from a field artificially irrigated that is stewed with terumah cabbage from a field watered by rain, is forbidden because it absorbs. Rabbi Akiba says: all things cooked together are permitted, except those with meat. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: liver renders other things forbidden, but does not become forbidden, because it gives off flavor but does not absorb.","4181":"If an egg is boiled with forbidden spices even its yolk is forbidden, because it absorbs. The water in which terumah has been stewed or pickled is forbidden to non-priests.","4182":"One must not put a cake of pressed terumah figs or dried terumah figs into fish-brine, since it spoils them. But one may place terumah wine into fish brine. One must not perfume the oil, But one may put honey and pepper into wine. One may not boil terumah wine, because it decreases it. Rabbi Judah permits this, because it improves it.","4183":"A non-priest drank honey of dates, wine of apples, vinegar from winter grapes, and all other kinds of fruit juice of terumah: Rabbi Eliezer makes him liable to repay their value and the fifth; But Rabbi Joshua exempts from the fifth. Rabbi Eliezer declares these susceptible to uncleanness as liquids. Rabbi Joshua says: the sages have not enumerated seven liquids as those that count spices,   but rather they stated: seven liquids make things susceptible to uncleaness, whereas all other liquids do not make susceptible.","4184":"One must not make dates into honey, apples into wine, winter-grapes into vinegar, or change any other kind of fruit that is terumah or second tithe from their natural state, except olives and grapes. One does not receive forty lashes on account of orlah except with that which comes from olives and grapes. Liquids cannot be brought as first fruits, except with that which comes from olives and grapes. And no fruit juice is susceptible to uncleanness as liquids except with that which comes from olives and grapes. And nothing that is derived from fruit can be offered on the altar except with that which comes from olives and grapes.","4185":"The stems of fresh figs and dried figs, klisim and carobs of terumah are forbidden to non-priests.","4186":"Seeds of terumah fruit: When he gathers them in, they are prohibited. But if he throws them away, they are permitted. Similarly, the bones of holy things: When he gathers them in, they are prohibited. But if he throws them away, they are permitted. Coarse bran is permitted. Fine bran of new wheat is forbidden, and old wheat permitted. One may act with regard to terumah as one does with hullin. One who sifts a kav or two of fine flour from a seah of wheat, must not leave the rest to ruin, but rather he should put it in a hidden place.","4187":"If a store-chamber was cleared of terumah wheat, they do not need to force him to sit down and collect each grain, but rather he may sweep it all up in his usual manner and then deposit hullin in it.","4188":"Similarly, if a jar of oil is upset, they do not need to force him to sit down and scoop it up with his fingers, but he may deal with it as he would in a case of hullin.","4189":"One who pours from jar to jar and three drops drip, he may place in it hullin. But if he inclined the jar on its side in order to drain it, it is terumah. How much terumat maaser of demai must there be for him to take it to the priest? One eighth of an eighth of a log.","4190":"Vetches of terumah may be given to cattle, to wild beasts or fowls. If an Israelite hired a cow from a priest, he may give it vetches of terumah to eat. But if a priest hired a cow from an Israelite, even though the responsibility of feeding it is his, he must not feed it with vetches of terumah. If an Israelite undertakes the care of a cow from a priest, he must not feed it with vetches of terumah. But if a priest undertakes the care of a cow from an Israelite, he may feed it on vetches of terumah.","4191":"One may burn terumah oil that has to be burnt in synagogues, houses of study, dark alleys, and for sick people with permission of the priest. If the daughter of an Israelite married to a priest regularly goes to her father's house, her father may burn such oil with her permission. One may also burn such oil in a house of celebration but not in a house of mourning, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Yose says: in the house of mourning, but not in a house of celebration.
